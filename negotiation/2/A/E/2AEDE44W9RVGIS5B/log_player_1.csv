"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to settle for such a significant discount just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still within a reasonable range of the deal I can get with John. I'm going to try and push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and the price you're willing to pay.  Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,020,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a done deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, the negotiations are getting tedious, and I'm worried he might just walk away.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is the most secure way to ensure I get the best possible outcome for my product."
