Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

``` 
At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Taking the $13,500 is better than counter-offering again and risking him going even lower or walking away.
