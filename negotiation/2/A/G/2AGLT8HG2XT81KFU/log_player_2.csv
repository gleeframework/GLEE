"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product for $8,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but only if he can get a price significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $15000 for the product.  This represents a substantial discount from my initial price.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a considerable amount more than what he's willing to pay.  He should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further. John's offer is a solid fallback option, but there's still room to see if he can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your initial asking price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $12500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I get a reasonable return on this valuable product.  I'm confident you'll find this price agreeable.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is tempting, Bob should still reject Alice's offer. He's already shown he's willing to pay $10,000, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further.  It's worth trying to get closer to his desired price by making another counteroffer. John's offer remains a viable safety net if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11000}
