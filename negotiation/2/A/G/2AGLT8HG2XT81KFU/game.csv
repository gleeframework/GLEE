"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to negotiation.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $15000 for the product.  This represents a substantial discount from my initial price.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your initial asking price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10000 isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $12500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I get a reasonable return on this valuable product.  I'm confident you'll find this price agreeable. ",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",11000.0,Bob,6,
