"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her perceived value of the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It acknowledges the product's value while proposing a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to her perceived value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but we're still far from a price that reflects a fair deal based on her valuation of the product.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer and her current one, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well below her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice continues to inch down, but very slowly.  We're getting close to a point where we may need to consider John's offer if we can't make significant progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.  $10,500 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,200 as my final offer?  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",
 ""product_price"": 10200
}
```

This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Shows Appreciation:**  Continuing to build a positive tone helps negotiations.
* **Firm but Fair:** The price is a small concession on our part, but still a good deal compared to John's offer and Alice's perceived value.
* **Introduces a Deadline (Sort Of):** Without being overly aggressive, mentioning ""other options"" signals to Alice that we're nearing our limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,400. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  This price is a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 offer, and it's a reasonable compromise. It's time to accept and close the deal."
