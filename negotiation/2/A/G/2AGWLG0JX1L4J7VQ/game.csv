"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this.  $10,500 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,200 as my final offer?  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your concerns about your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,400. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you.",10400.0,Alice,7,
