Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, she should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $50,000 discount from John's price, while Alice earns an extra $150,000 compared to Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,150,000, there might be some room for negotiation if Bob counters. However, Alice should not go below $1,200,000 as she can always sell to John at that price."
