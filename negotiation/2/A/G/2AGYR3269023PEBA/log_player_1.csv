Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $9,000 is a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering Bob's valuation. It's better than rejecting his offer and risking a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a lower price or the need to sell to John for less than my desired amount."
