"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
