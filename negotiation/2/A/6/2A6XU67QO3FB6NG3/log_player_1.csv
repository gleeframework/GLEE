"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation, considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer of $1,300,000, closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000 than our minimum acceptable price ($800,000). This gives us room to negotiate downwards while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" without explicitly revealing why it's so valuable to Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point for negotiation,"" we signal flexibility and invite Bob to engage in a back-and-forth discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our initial asking price and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate further. Since we are only in round 2 out of 10, it's worth countering to try and secure a better deal. We are confident we can negotiate a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers you. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,225,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's offer but stand firm that $1,000,000 is too low. By countering with $1,225,000, we're making a significant concession from our initial offer ($1,300,000) while still aiming for a price above the midpoint between our initial offers. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** We reiterate the product's unique value *to Bob*, subtly reminding him of the potential gains he stands to make.  
* **Seeking Compromise:** The message frames this counteroffer as a ""middle ground,"" demonstrating our willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally moving towards our desired price range, but we still have room to negotiate.  We're at $1,100,000, and while that's a good profit, we started at $1,300,000. There's a chance we can close the gap further in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway at $1,162,500? This recognizes the value you gain while allowing me to feel good about the deal."",
""product_price"": 1162500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're proposing a price exactly between our last offer ($1,225,000) and his counteroffer ($1,100,000). This classic negotiation tactic signals fairness and a strong desire to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes that we're ""getting closer"" and appreciates Bob's engagement. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative atmosphere.
* **Win-Win Language:** By saying we'll ""both feel good"" about this price, we reiterate the mutually beneficial nature of the deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above $1,162,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled this is his final offer by stating it's ""the lowest I'm willing to go."" While we could push for a slightly higher price, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting $1,150,000 secures a significant profit ($350,000 above our minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
