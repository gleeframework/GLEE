"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit shy of that number. How about $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12500.0,Bob,4,
