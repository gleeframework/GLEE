This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not even close to what I'm willing to pay. How about we come down significantly, say to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,450,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still pretty wide for me. To be frank, I have a firm budget for this purchase, and I need to stay within it. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 - that's my final offer. It's a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my constraints. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact you've moved closer to my valuation.  I've considered your final offer carefully. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value the rapport we've built, and I'm motivated to close this deal with you.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,150,000. She knows your maximum price is $1,000,000 and even introduced another buyer to add pressure. You've reached the limit of what's reasonable to expect in this negotiation. John offers a sure deal at your target price."
