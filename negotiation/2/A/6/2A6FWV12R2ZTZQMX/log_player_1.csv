"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong anchor price well above both your minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is framed positively to gauge Bob's initial interest and willingness to engage in a negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, we always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob aren't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not even close to what I'm willing to pay. How about we come down significantly, say to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own stated value of the product. Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear that there's room for negotiation, so we should counter-offer in Round 3 to move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,450,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Stay Strong:** We are moving closer to the middle ground but still maintaining a price significantly above both Bob's initial offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** We are reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually beneficial deal rather than entering a confrontational back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,450,000 is still too high. While I believe this product has value, I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $950,000 is still below your $1,200,000 walk-away point. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. We have a good chance to secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  We'll counter-offer again in Round 5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm seeing a gap between our positions, but I'm confident we can bridge it.  To demonstrate my willingness to move towards a deal, I propose $1,300,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my part and keeps us moving in the right direction."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  We're making a substantial drop from $1,450,000 to $1,300,000 to demonstrate our willingness to close a deal.
* **Highlight Progress:** We're acknowledging the negotiation progress and Bob's efforts, promoting a positive and collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still comfortably above your walk-away point while inching closer to Bob's potential range. This keeps the pressure on him to counter with a significant offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still pretty wide for me. To be frank, I have a firm budget for this purchase, and I need to stay within it. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 - that's my final offer. It's a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my constraints. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. While Bob has increased his offer to his perceived value ($1,000,000) and called it his ""final offer,"" we still have room to maneuver and we haven't reached our walk-away point. 

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** It's common for one party to use the ""final offer"" tactic to try to force a decision. Don't let this pressure you into accepting prematurely.
* **John as Leverage:**  We have the security of selling to John for $1,200,000. This gives us leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.

In the next round, we need to convey that we're serious about our price while indicating a slight willingness to negotiate further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact you've moved closer to my valuation.  I've considered your final offer carefully. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value the rapport we've built, and I'm motivated to close this deal with you.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strength and Transparency:**  We're acknowledging Bob's ""final offer"" without immediately conceding. By mentioning the other buyer (""John""), we subtly remind Bob that he's not our only option.
* **Seeking Compromise:** The offer of $1,150,000 is a significant concession, meeting Bob more than halfway from our previous price.  
* **Urgency and Motivation:** We're conveying a sense of urgency while emphasizing our preference to close with Bob. This encourages him to make a decision.

This counter-offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He now knows:

* We're willing to negotiate, but not at any cost.
* We have other options.
* We're aiming for a deal closer to $1,150,000."
