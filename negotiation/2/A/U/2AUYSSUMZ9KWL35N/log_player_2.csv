# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $950000. This is a significant price reduction considering the product's worth to you.  I believe this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though you could buy the product from John for $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $950,000 saves you $50,000. 
* **It's within your budget.**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and Alice's offer is below that.

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to maximize your savings.**"
