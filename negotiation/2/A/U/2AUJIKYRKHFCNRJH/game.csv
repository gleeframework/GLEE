"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product holds considerable value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to consider $1,025,000 as my final offer. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair given the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
