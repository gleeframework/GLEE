Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,200,000). This allows her to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and her initial offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be a price point both parties find agreeable. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has the security of John's offer, giving her leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product holds considerable value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer aims to show flexibility while still pursuing a price closer to Alice's target.  It's not a perfect split of the difference, keeping the pressure on Bob.
* **Maintaining Value Assertion:**  The message reinforces the product's value, justifying a higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:** By moving down from her initial offer, Alice signals a willingness to negotiate, potentially encouraging Bob to raise his offer in return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, $950,000 is still significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counteroffers are moving up slowly, suggesting he might be unwilling to reach a price that truly satisfies Alice. 
* **John as Leverage:** Alice has the security of John's offer, which is substantially higher. It's worthwhile to see if she can push Bob closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find common ground. However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm willing to consider $1,025,000 as my final offer. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair given the product's true worth."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By presenting this as her ""final offer,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and limits further back-and-forth.
* **Slight Concession:** The small reduction from $1,050,000 to $1,025,000 shows flexibility but not desperation.
* **Deadline Implied:**  While not explicitly stated, the tone implies that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, Alice is prepared to walk away and sell to John.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  Alice is still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's current offer, leveraging her backup plan."
