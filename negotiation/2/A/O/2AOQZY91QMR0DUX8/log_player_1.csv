{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's valued at no less than $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $9500. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can likely do better with some negotiation.  I will counteroffer and see where we land."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,500 is a bit lower than what I had in mind, but I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position and appreciate your flexibility. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9600 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I could keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing the deal and only ending up with John's offer of $8,000.  $9,600 is a good price and I can still make a decent profit."
