"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,000,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly value the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great value for you, and it reflects the true worth of the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
