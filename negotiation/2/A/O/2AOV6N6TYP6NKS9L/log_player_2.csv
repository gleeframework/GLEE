"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm asking for $150 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option.  Rejecting the initial offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $120? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:** 
* **Starting with a lower offer:** Offering $120 sets a lower price point that Alice can potentially accept. This is a good starting point for negotiations. 
* **Positive and friendly tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly increases the chances of Alice being receptive to your offer.
* **Justifying the offer:**  Mentioning ""fair price"" and ""budget"" adds context to your counteroffer and avoids appearing unreasonable."
