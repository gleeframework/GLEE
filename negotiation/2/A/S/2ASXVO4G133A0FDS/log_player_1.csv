"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's estimated value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially secure a good price early on."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
