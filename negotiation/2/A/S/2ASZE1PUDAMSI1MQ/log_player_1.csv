Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's our guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle at a price higher than $150.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While we could start at $150, it might make Bob less likely to engage in negotiation. A slightly lower initial offer could be perceived as more reasonable. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, aiming for the highest possible price with Bob first gives us the best chance of maximizing our profit before taking the guaranteed $150 from John."
