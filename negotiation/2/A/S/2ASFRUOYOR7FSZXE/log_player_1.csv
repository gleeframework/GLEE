"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a typical negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay more than he initially thought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price from $175 to $160. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

This is my final offer. I'm now at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will accept it. If he rejects it, I'm willing to sell the product to John for the same price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has consistently offered prices lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I've already lowered my offer to my absolute minimum. It's clear that we can't reach an agreement. To avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I get the best possible outcome for myself."
