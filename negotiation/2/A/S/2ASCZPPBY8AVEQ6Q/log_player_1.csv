"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I want to try to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially gain a better deal."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however. How about $10,500?

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  The product is worth $15,000 to Bob and we still have several rounds of negotiation left."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  It's a reasonable compromise and still gives you a good value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We've gotten close, but I still believe I can get a higher price, and the product is definitely worth more to Bob than $9,800.  It's better to risk a couple more rounds than settling too low."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to the end of negotiations, and while I believe I could squeeze a little more out of Bob, the risk of him rejecting my counteroffer is high.  I don't want to risk getting nothing and losing the opportunity to sell to John for $8,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and while it's not ideal, it's better than risking nothing at all."
