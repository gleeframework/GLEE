"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can meet my minimum requirements.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
