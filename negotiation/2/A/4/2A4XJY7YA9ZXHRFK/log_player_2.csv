Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can meet my minimum requirements.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,200,000. 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is at Bob's maximum budget.** He has no room to negotiate lower.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed deal.** There's no risk of further negotiations falling apart.
* **Time is a factor.**  While Bob could continue negotiating, he has only 5 rounds left. There's no guarantee he'll get a better deal. 

By choosing John, Bob ensures he gets the product at his maximum price without risking further negotiations and potential losses."
