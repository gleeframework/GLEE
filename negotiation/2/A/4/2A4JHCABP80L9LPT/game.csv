"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. My asking price is $10,000, which I believe is fair given its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value.  How about $9,500?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it gets us closer to finding a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This is a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.",9000.0,Bob,4,
