"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding common ground, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my offer to $850,000. This price still allows me to achieve my goals while providing you with a fair deal. I'm confident that we can finalize this transaction soon. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $775,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement and finalize the deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  It's a valuable asset with strong future prospects, and I believe a price closer to $800,000 would be more fair.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price gives you a great deal, and it allows me to achieve my desired outcome. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with this compromise.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $795,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement and finalize the deal.",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up on your price. $795,000 is definitely getting closer to what I'm looking for. However, as this product is truly unique and holds a lot of potential, I can only accept a price of $800,000. It's my minimum acceptable price, and it ensures I can meet my own financial goals. This is my final offer, and it's an opportunity for you to secure a valuable asset at a fair price.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,7,
