Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, signaling that I'm open to some back and forth.

This strategy allows me to potentially get a good price while keeping the negotiation open. I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further. If the negotiation drags on or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. While $60 is better than nothing, it's not worth risking a better deal with John or potentially negotiating a higher price with Bob.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $60 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a great price for this amazing product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I remind Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $90 is still a good deal.
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language to maintain a friendly and open tone. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while moving closer to a price I'm comfortable with. If Bob rejects this, I'll still have the option to sell to John, but I'm hoping to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is closer but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you do $75? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still significantly lower than I'd like to get. I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $150. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $75, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $85 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm sure you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to a price that's closer to my minimum, but still shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly to avoid any potential animosity.

This counteroffer is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John for $150, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
