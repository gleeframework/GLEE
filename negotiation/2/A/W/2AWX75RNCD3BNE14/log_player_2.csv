Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $60 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a great price for this amazing product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $75, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $85 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm sure you won't regret it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, it's clear she's unlikely to go below $85.  At this point, John's guaranteed offer of $80 is the better deal. It's better to secure a price you know you can get rather than risk the negotiation falling through."
