{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $12,000 is significantly above Alice's value of $8,000 and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There's a good chance you can get the price lower through counteroffers.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You have the option to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a bad deal."

Round 2

{""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her value, leaving room for compromise.
* **Aggressive but fair:**  It shows you're serious about getting a good deal, but it's not so low as to be insulting.

* **Potential for a lower price:**  You've already demonstrated your willingness to counter, and Alice has shown some flexibility.  There's a good chance you can get the price down even further.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** As before, having the option to buy from John provides you with leverage and allows you to take calculated risks during negotiations."

* **Getting closer:**  This offer is closer to Alice's latest price, but it's still a substantial difference, suggesting that there's still room for compromise.

{""product_price"": 12500}
```

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer, but it's still below Alice's price. It's a clear signal that you're willing to meet her halfway but are also nearing your limit.
* **High stakes:** With only two rounds remaining, this offer puts pressure on Alice to make a decision. It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of a lower price is worth it.
* **Backup plan:** John's offer provides a fallback option, ensuring that you won't be forced to overpay if Alice rejects your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too close to John's:** With only one round left, Alice's offer is only $500 less than John's price. The time and effort needed to negotiate further may not be worth the potential savings.
* **Risk of stalemate:**  If Alice rejects your counteroffer in the final round, you risk being left with no deal. 
* **Guaranteed purchase:**  Buying from John ensures you get the product at a price within your budget, avoiding the uncertainty of further negotiation.

While a slightly lower price from Alice is possible, the risk of failure and the limited time remaining make John's offer the most reliable option at this point."
