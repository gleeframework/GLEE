"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal.  There's a significant gap between Alice's value ($800,000) and Bob's maximum ($1,500,000), so there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her own value. This approach attempts to quickly establish a middle ground for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation and allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than his maximum price from John ($1,500,000) and still allows him to get a good deal while leaving room for Alice to make a profit.  There's no need to risk further negotiation at this point."
