Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is well below Bob's value of $1,500,000, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving me a good margin.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is a good price, I can likely do better.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000.  It also gives me a bit more than Bob's last offer, but leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
