"I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980000.
