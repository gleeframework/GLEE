"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $100? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $95. That's the lowest I'm comfortable going.",95.0,Bob,4,
