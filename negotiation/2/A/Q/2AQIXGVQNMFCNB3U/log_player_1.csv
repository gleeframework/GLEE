"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and uses positive language to encourage a collaborative negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets a higher reference point for subsequent discussions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start with that number and see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is far too low, matching his perceived value but significantly undercutting mine. I'll reject this offer and use the next round to attempt to steer the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move forward, I can offer a revised price of $1,400,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding but Holding Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's budget but make it clear that his initial offer is unacceptable. 
* **Significant Reduction:** The substantial drop from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000 signals a willingness to negotiate and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and my budget. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. Accepting at $1,000,000 would mean leaving $200,000 on the table.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can bridge that gap. I'll aim for a more aggressive counteroffer in the next round to keep the momentum going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see you're making an effort, we need to find a solution that truly works for both of us.  To be frank, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm shifting to a more direct and assertive tone, making it clear that substantial compromises have been made, and my bottom line is approaching.
* **Final Offer Signal:** By stating ""I can't accept anything less,"" I'm signaling that this is nearing my final offer, prompting Bob to seriously consider it.
* **Justified Price:** I'm reiterating the value justification to counter Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower. 
* **Limited Concessions:** The price reduction is smaller this time, indicating I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that. I can go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we're both bringing to the table. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still $100,000 short of my guaranteed sale price with John. While there's a chance Bob might go higher, the increments are getting smaller, and I'm running the risk of him walking away entirely.  

At this point, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential, but uncertain, upside of continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'd rather secure the $1,200,000 from John than gamble on Bob potentially increasing his offer by a smaller amount in the remaining rounds."
