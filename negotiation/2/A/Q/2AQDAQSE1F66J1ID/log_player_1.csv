Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-counteroffer.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's not even close to my minimum value.  I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and closer to what I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair compromise and will hopefully be enough to convince Bob to agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm confident that selling to John for $1,200,000 is a good decision.  This guarantees me a profit and ensures I don't lose too much time in further negotiations with Bob."
