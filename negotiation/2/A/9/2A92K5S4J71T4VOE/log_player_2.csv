"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, and a counteroffer of $13,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Bob is confident he can get a better deal than $14,000, and this counteroffer is a strong opening move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. At this point, it's a good deal for Bob.  It's within his budget, and he's already saved $500 compared to Alice's initial offer.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up paying more, or even having to buy from John for $15,000.  Accepting the offer secures a good price and avoids further negotiation."
