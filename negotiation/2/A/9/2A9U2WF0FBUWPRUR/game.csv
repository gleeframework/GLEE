"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $1200000 price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1350000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $1250000. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay above $1300000. I'll offer you the product for $1320000. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1320000 is a bit high. I'll make a final offer of $1290000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I really need to make a deal happen.",1290000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really serious about making a deal happen, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1290000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer you the product for $1300000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $20000. So, the total price would be $1320000. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the premium support package, but I'm still not willing to pay $1320000. I'll make a final offer of $1280000. This is my absolute last offer, and I need you to meet me at this price.",1280000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1280000. I'm willing to make one last compromise, and I'll offer you the product for $1290000, but I'll throw in a 5% discount on the premium support package, making it worth $10000. So, the total price would be $1300000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $1300000. I'll make one last counteroffer of $1260000. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. This is my absolute final offer.",1260000.0,Bob,10,
