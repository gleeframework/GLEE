Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, giving Bob a reason to counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and friendly message:** This helps establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and is a reasonable compromise. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a profit for you."
