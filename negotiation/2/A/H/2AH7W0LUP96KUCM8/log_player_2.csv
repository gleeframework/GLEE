Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and it seems she is unlikely to go lower. It's better to secure the product at his desired price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
