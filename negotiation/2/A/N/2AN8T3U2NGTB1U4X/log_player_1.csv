"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $110 gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Openness:** Stating I'm open to negotiation shows I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:**  While I don't need to explicitly state the value to Bob, I'm hinting at it by saying it's a ""great product"".

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged.  Starting high allows for potential concessions while still potentially getting close to my minimum of $100.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe the product is worth around $90 to me. Would you consider a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still a $5 difference.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can potentially get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John's offer of $100 provides security. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John.

**Strategy:**

Continuing to negotiate with Bob is the best option at this point. I want to maximize my profit, and rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $95 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. Would you be willing to go up to $98? It's a fair price considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hinting at why my price is justified.
* **Specific Number:** I'm providing a concrete number ($98) for Bob to consider.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $98, I'm aiming to:

* **Close the Gap:**  Reduce the price difference and make the deal more likely.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Keep some room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers again.
* **Stay Above Minimum:**  Stay above my minimum selling price of $100, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I would like to stay within my budget. How about $96? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $96 is only $4 away from my minimum selling price of $100.
* **Limited Upside:** There's a high chance of further negotiation if I reject the offer. However, Bob seems firm on his budget, and I'm not confident I can get significantly higher.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're already halfway through the rounds.  Accepting the offer now ensures a sale and prevents the risk of further negotiations failing.

**Strategy:**

It's time to be realistic.  While I would prefer a higher price, I can't risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer is a smart move, securing a sale and minimizing the risk of ending up with nothing."
