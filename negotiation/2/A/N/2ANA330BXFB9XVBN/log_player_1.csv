"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired $15,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm offering $14,500 as a counteroffer. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current offer, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's valuation, it's still too low for me. I'm hoping to reach a deal closer to my desired price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is a significant move toward Bob's offer, but still within my desired range. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. At this point, with only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement with Bob is high. It's better to guarantee a sale to John at $15,000, which is my minimum desired price."
