{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. I believe it's a steal considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum acceptable price, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary. It also frames the offer as a ""steal"" to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your valuation, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  Rejecting allows me to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $14,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $14200. I hope this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $14,200 is a decent compromise and significantly higher than selling to John.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal for me."
