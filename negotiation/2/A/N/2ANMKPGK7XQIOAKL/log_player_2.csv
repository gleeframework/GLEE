Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price.  How about we start at $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  It's better to secure the product now than risk losing it in further negotiation rounds."
