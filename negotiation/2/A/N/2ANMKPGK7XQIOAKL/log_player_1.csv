"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality asset. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your business."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still below what it's worth to me. This is a reasonable starting point that gives me room to negotiate and leaves the door open for a potential deal.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob, aiming to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price.  How about we start at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still far from my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a more agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
