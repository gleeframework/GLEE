Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the chance he'll accept while still securing a significant profit for you.

By starting at $130, there's room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, but you're still ensuring a good profit even if he accepts immediately."
