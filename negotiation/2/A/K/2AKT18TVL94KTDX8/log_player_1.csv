**Reasoning:** 

Bob is consistently using a ""meet in the middle"" tactic, and we're now below $1,000,000.  While he may be willing to go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll meet my minimum price in the remaining rounds. It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
