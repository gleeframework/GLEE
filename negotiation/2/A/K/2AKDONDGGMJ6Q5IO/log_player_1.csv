Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,200,000.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering a price that is significantly more than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000. This allows me to take a bit of a risk and try for a higher price. 

This offer maximizes my potential profit while still leaving a good chance of Bob accepting."
