"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially maximize my profit.  It also demonstrates that I believe the product is valuable and am not afraid to ask for what I believe it's worth."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, it doesn't leave me any room for profit. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
