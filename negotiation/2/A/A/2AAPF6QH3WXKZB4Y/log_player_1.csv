"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll be able to make a good profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum value ($1,500,000), I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target. I also want to see if Bob is serious about making a deal.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially close the deal for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's potential and your own projected profits, I'm willing to go down to $1,700,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $1,600,000 is just $100,000 short of my minimum acceptable price, I'm still within a range where negotiating for a better price is worthwhile. 
* **Negotiation dynamics:** Bob has shown he's willing to compromise, so there's a good chance we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe I can potentially push Bob to $1,650,000 or even closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,620,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value I can get from it. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,620,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,620,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $1,620,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We're now in Round 6, and I want to avoid potentially losing a deal with Bob and having to sell to John at my minimum price.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  I risk losing even more money if I keep rejecting Bob's offers and he ultimately decides to walk away.

While I'd ideally like to reach my target price of $1,500,000, accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit. It's a calculated risk to secure a deal now rather than potentially losing everything."
