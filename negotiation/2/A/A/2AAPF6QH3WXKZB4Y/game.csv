"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll be able to make a good profit. Let me know what you think!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's potential and your own projected profits, I'm willing to go down to $1,700,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit away from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows for both of us to make a good profit. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,620,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value I can get from it. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1620000.0,Bob,6,
