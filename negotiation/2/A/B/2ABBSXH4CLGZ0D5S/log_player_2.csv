"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love!  I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's best to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's a starting point, and we can negotiate further based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has agreed to meet your maximum budget. There's no point in further negotiation or going to John, as you won't get a better price."
