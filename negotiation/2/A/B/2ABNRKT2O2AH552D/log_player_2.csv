Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in this product, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value it brings.  Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,750 isn't quite getting me there. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,125. It's a small compromise from both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?
