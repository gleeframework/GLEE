"Bob, I understand you're interested in this product, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This still leaves you with a significant profit, and it's a fair price for the value it brings.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit below $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,750 isn't quite getting me there. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,125. It's a small compromise from both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  Let's meet in the middle one last time at $9,875. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",9875.0,Alice,7,
