Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your backup plan. You are guaranteed to sell the product for $1,500,000 to John. This means any offer you make to Bob should be above that price to make a profit.  You need to balance maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the ""unique value proposition"" without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Price:** The price of $1,750,000 is a significant markup from both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a substantial profit if he accepts outright.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down towards $1,500,000, knowing that's your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob doesn't know about John. Your confidence and the product's perceived value are key to a successful negotiation."
