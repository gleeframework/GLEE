Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than Bob's ideal price.  While $11,200 is closer, Bob can still try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for further negotiation and may lead to a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's last offer, but is still trying to save some money.  $10,500 is a compromise, and Bob is hoping Alice will accept, as he has already rejected a higher price.  If Alice continues to reject, Bob may consider buying from John in the next round to avoid further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation has reached a stalemate.  Alice continues to hold firm at a price higher than Bob's desired goal.  With only a few rounds remaining,  buying from John at $12,000 becomes the more sensible option.  While it's not the best price, it avoids further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
