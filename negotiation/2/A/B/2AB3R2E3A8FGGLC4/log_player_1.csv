Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a higher profit. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the offer in a confident but not overly aggressive manner.
* **Open for negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" Alice invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price.

**Worst-case scenario:** Bob rejects the offer, and Alice sells the product to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
