"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might be offering, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with $95.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $95 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
