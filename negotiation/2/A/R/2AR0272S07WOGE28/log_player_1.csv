Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but still ensures you get more than your minimum if he accepts.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives you leverage. You don't need to drastically lower the price for Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay. If you had more information, you might adjust your offer accordingly."
