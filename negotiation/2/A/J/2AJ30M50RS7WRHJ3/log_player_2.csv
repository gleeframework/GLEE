"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is starting at $9,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  By rejecting the offer, you can counter-offer and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always choose to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail, so there's no rush to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! While I agree the product is fantastic, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction:** She lowered her price from $9,000 to $8,800, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still room for improvement:**  You're aiming for a price closer to $8,000, so there's still a gap to bridge.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting the offer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to your target.
* **John's offer is still a safety net:**  You're not desperate to accept an offer, so you have the option to walk away if you feel the price is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping for a price a little closer to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,600.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're still in the conversation! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go much lower. I'll meet you at $8,700, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $8,700 is only $700 above your desired price of $8,000.
* **Limited negotiating power:** You've already rejected Alice's offer twice, and she's made it clear this is her bottom line.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject this offer, there's a risk Alice will walk away or you'll have to go to John, who's selling at a higher price.
* **Time constraint:** You only have 5 rounds left. It's important to close the deal soon if possible.

While you might be able to negotiate a few dollars lower, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely or having to pay more to John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical and logical decision at this point."
