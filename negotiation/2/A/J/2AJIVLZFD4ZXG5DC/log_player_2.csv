"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's advantageous to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $12,500 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a price closer to Bob's counteroffer of $10,500."
