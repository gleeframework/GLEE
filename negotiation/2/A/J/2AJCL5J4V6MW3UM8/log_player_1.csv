"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""unique opportunity"" and the ""true value"" of the product to entice Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage and make a counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget without immediately revealing my minimum acceptable price. This approach allows me to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my absolute floor, so I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and the value it can bring to you.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's perspective:** Showing I recognize his concerns can build rapport.
* **Maintain a firm position:** I'm not drastically lowering my price, showing my product's value.
* **Open for compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a price that ""works for both of us,"" keeping negotiation open. 

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between showing flexibility while still keeping the price higher than Bob's initial offer. I hope this encourages him to compromise and meet me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1700000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a better option than accepting Bob's offer at this point. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, trying to get him to come up closer to my price point. It's getting late in the negotiation, so I need to start pushing for a deal that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 for this unique product. It's a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:** I show understanding and respect for Bob's perspective.
* **Bridge the gap:** I emphasize finding a ""fair compromise"" and propose a price that's halfway between our current positions.
* **Highlight the product's value:** I subtly remind Bob of the unique qualities of the product to justify the price.
* **Emphasize the reduction:** I emphasize the ""significant price reduction"" to make the offer seem more enticing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to make a strong move towards compromise without conceding too much. By highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the price reduction, I hope to sway Bob into accepting a price closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1600000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've gone through several rounds, and it's clear that Bob isn't willing to meet my price expectations.  

Given that we have limited rounds left, it's more advantageous for me to sell to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lead to an even lower price."
