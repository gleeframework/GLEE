"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1000000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $1050000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is still too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think $1050000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable going any higher than that. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
