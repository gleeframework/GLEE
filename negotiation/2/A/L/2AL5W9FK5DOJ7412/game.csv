"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $75.  Would you be open to that?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $125 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm working with a tight budget.  Would you consider $90? I think that's a fair offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $90. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,5,
