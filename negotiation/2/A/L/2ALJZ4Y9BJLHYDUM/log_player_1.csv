Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price point is too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential return on investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $850,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's a good deal, and prolonging the negotiation has a risk of Bob lowering his offer or me needing to settle for John's offer."
