"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's potential, that price point is too high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $700,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price considering the potential return on investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
