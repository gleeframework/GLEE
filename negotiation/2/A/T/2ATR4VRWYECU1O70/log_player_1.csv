Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

Here's why:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $12,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a sale."
