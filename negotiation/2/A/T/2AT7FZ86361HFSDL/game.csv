"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1200000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product, as I mentioned before. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
