{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you at $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still allow you a healthy profit while giving me a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than my ideal price, but closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further to get closer to my target price. There's still room for a compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,150,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at $1,150,000, which is within my budget and closer to my desired price. While I'd still prefer to pay $1,125,000, the added extras she's offering might make up for the difference. It's time to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
