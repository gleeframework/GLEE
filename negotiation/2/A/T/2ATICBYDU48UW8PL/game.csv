"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you at $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still allow you a healthy profit while giving me a good deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,150,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more wiggle room. Let's meet in the middle at $1,125,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,150,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
