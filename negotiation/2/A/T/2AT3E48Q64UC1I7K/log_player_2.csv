# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both her value and my maximum price. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  I'll make a counteroffer to try and bring the price down."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I agree the product looks promising, that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $850,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000, and I want to make sure I'm not losing out on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but her current offer is still above my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation before I consider John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $925,000?"",

}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other opportunities, and I don't want to miss out on a better deal. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While it's a bit higher than I'd hoped, it's a reasonable price and significantly less than John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
