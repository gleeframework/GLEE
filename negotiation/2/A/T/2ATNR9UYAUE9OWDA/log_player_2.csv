"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll reject Alice's offer since I can get the product from John for $10,000, which is lower than Alice's offer.
