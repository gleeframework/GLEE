"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product but I can only go up to $700,000 at this time. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $700,000 is too low for this product.  Would you consider $900,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the true value of what you're getting.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. This is my final offer, let me know if it works for you.",850000.0,Bob,4,
