While we're getting close, we're still significantly above Bob's perceived value of the product. It's unlikely he'll jump much higher. We need to encourage him to see more value or decide if it's time to switch to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on the price. To help you see the value, I'd like to highlight [mention a specific feature or benefit that aligns with Bob's needs/interests, and explains the higher price].  Considering this added value, I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Highlight Value:**  We're shifting from pure price negotiation to emphasizing the product's value proposition.  This aims to justify the price difference and potentially increase Bob's perceived value.
* **Final Offer:** By introducing a sense of scarcity and a ""final offer,"" we create a stronger incentive for Bob to act.
* **Mention Other Buyers:**  Subtly reminding Bob of your alternative (John) reinforces your position and the product's desirability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the added value you mentioned, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough call, but consider these points:

* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has likely reached his maximum price. His ""final offer"" and mention of ""other options"" suggest he's serious. 
* **Time Remaining:**  Only two rounds are left. Pushing further risks losing both Bob and John.
* **Profit Margin:** While $1,300,000 is less than ideal, it's still a $100,000 profit over John's offer.

Based on this, the most logical decision now is:

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's better to secure a reasonable profit now than risk getting stuck with a no-deal and having to accept John's offer, which would yield no profit."
