Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $77. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're not ready to go as low as $65, Alice. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine - would $71 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 71
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not quite ready to accept $71. How about we try $79? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is very slowly coming down on price, and we are running out of rounds to get a better deal.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $79, and at this point, it's not worth risking paying John $80."
