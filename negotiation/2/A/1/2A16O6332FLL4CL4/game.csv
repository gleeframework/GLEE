"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $77. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",77.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're not ready to go as low as $65, Alice. How about we split the difference between your offer and mine - would $71 work for you?",71.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not quite ready to accept $71. How about we try $79? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",79.0,Alice,5,
