,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $14000 is tempting, I'm hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'd love to close the deal, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $15000. This is my final offer, and it's a price I'm confident we can both be happy with.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I'm prepared to drop my price to $14500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I genuinely believe it's a fair price for the product. Let's finalize this deal.",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $14500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13200. I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. Can you consider it?",13200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm starting to feel like we might not be able to agree on a price. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll offer the product for $13800. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I hope it's something you can work with.",13800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $12500. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can meet me halfway. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
