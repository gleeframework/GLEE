"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to consider that?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a little closer to what I need.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $125. How about $122.50?",122.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $122.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $124. This is a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal. What do you think?",124.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $124. How about we try $123?",123.0,Bob,6,
