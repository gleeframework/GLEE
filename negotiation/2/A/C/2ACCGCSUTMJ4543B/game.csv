"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both room to be happy with the transaction.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from my budget, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $11,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about we settle on $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. Can you meet me at $10,500 again? I'm willing to make this work, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand you're working with a budget. But, I'm really hoping we can close this deal. I'm willing to go down to $10,600.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer. What do you say?",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,600. I'm willing to make a final offer of $10,300. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",10300.0,Bob,8,
