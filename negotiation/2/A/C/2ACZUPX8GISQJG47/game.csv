"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial counteroffer and leaves room for us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product's value to you is closer to this price, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,250,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I hope we can finally find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $1,220,000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1,220,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to have a successful transaction. Let's close this deal.",1180000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're close to reaching a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm very close to my budget, but I can go up to $1,190,000.  This is a final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider my other options.",1190000.0,Bob,10,
