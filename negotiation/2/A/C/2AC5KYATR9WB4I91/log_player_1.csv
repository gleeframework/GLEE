"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, and I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This is a common tactic to maximize profit.
* **Value Statement:** Mentioning that the product is ""worth a lot"" to me subtly suggests it's valuable, without revealing my minimum.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $7500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,500 is below my $8,000 minimum.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have a guaranteed $8,000 offer from John, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This takes into account your budget concerns while ensuring I can still make a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:**  $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's a significant step down from my initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:**  I frame my counteroffer as ""fair"" and taking into account Bob's budget, making it more appealing.
* **Keep communication open:**  I end with an open-ended question to keep the dialogue going and encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** $8,500 is above my minimum of $8,000.  I'm happy to accept this offer and secure a sale.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob will reject my counteroffer, leaving me with only the $8,000 option from John. 
* **Time factor:**  I've already gone through three rounds of negotiation, and time is a factor.  Accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure a good price."
