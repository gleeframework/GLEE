"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than $15,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $12,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's still a good deal for Alice (above her desired selling price of $15,000). This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness in negotiating while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is now within Bob's budget and a good deal considering his initial goal of $10,000. Accepting this offer saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal entirely to John is too high at this point."
