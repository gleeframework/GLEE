Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, and it leaves room for negotiation. It's likely that Bob will accept, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him. However, if he rejects, you can then adjust your counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. You can likely get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate while still ensuring you receive a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. You can likely squeeze out a bit more by counteroffering.  John's offer is a safety net, but you can afford to be more aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still lower than your previous one. This shows you're serious about a deal but are also trying to meet him halfway. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the gap and secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While it's frustrating that Bob keeps rejecting your offers, his latest offer is only $80,000 above John's offer.  There's a good chance that Bob is trying to push the price down as low as possible, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better result.  It's time to secure the sale with John to avoid further delays and uncertainty."
