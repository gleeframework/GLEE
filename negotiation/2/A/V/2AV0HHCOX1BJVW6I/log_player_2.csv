"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you control over the negotiation and the opportunity to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the lower price, highlighting the value to you and the fairness of the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $850,000 is still a bit below your maximum budget, allowing for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your budget, it's still above your preferred price point. 
* **Continuing to negotiate is advantageous.** You can try to get closer to your target price by sending another counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  If negotiations fail, you can always secure the product for $800,000 from John, giving you a clear fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a midpoint between Alice's offer of $975,000 and your previous offer of $850,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.

* **Strong Position:**  This counteroffer is still below your maximum budget of $800,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000. How about $960,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your budget, you're still better off trying to negotiate further.
* **You have a strong fallback option.** You can always buy from John for $800,000, giving you leverage in negotiations.
* **You've been successful in lowering the price.** You've already brought the price down from $1,100,000 to $960,000. Continuing to negotiate could get you even closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $960,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to lower the price:** This counteroffer further reduces the price, moving closer to your target while still leaving room for potential concessions from Alice.

* **Maintaining leverage:**  This counteroffer keeps you below your maximum budget, giving you more flexibility in case Alice rejects it again."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a very desirable product, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to make one final concession at $945,000.  This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $945,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $945,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting close to your budget.** At $945,000, you're only $145,000 over your maximum budget.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her absolute best offer, indicating that further negotiation may be fruitless.
* **Strong fallback option:** If you reject this offer, you can still buy from John for $800,000. 

While you could continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, the risk of losing the deal is high. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product, and the price is reasonable considering your maximum budget and the fact that it is below the product's value to Alice."
