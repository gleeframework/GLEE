"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving towards a more reasonable price. However, we're still significantly above his initial offer and below my minimum.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can push the price closer to $1 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000. How about $960,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for such a valuable product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $960,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to my acceptable range, but I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $950,000."
