Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is simply too high for me.  Given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and its current market value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 remains out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your last price. This reflects a serious commitment to acquire the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving in the right direction, further negotiation is unlikely to net a better result than John's standing offer.  It's time to move on."
