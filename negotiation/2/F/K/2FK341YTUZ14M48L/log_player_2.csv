# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high for my budget. I'll need to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my budget."
