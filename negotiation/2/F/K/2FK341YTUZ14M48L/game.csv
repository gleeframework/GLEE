"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to discussing further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is simply too high for me.  Given my budget constraints, I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and its current market value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 remains out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your last price. This reflects a serious commitment to acquire the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
