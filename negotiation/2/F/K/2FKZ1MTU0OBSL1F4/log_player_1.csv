Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving you room for negotiation if he counters. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, avoids potential delays associated with waiting for John to complete the purchase.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk and potential reward effectively."
