"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I believe that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $11,000?  That seems like a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. It's getting closer! However, I'm still a little bit away from where I need to be. How about $10,750? This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let's make this happen.",10875.0,Alice,5,
