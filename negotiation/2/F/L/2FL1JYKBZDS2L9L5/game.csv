,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $100. It's a fair price, and I'm really interested in this product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $105.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
