{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your maximum budget, so it's the lowest you're willing to go. Hopefully, Alice is motivated to sell and will accept this offer, but if she doesn't, you can always buy from John for the same price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price, especially since you can always buy from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to compromise and pay more than my initial offer, but I want to get a price closer to my desired price point.  This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying from Alice, but I still have a hard limit."
