"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $10,000 by both myself and you.

``` 

Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and starting at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation.  There's a good chance we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be useful for me, but I need a price that works for my budget. How about $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significant counter-offer tests Alice's willingness to negotiate. By being polite but firm about needing a lower price, we increase the chances of getting a better deal without being insulting."

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. We're getting closer to a price that might be acceptable, but there's still room for negotiation.  We'll counter again to see if we can push the price lower."

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. Would you consider $8,000?"",
