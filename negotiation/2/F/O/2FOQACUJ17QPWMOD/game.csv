"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise - I'll sell it to you for $160. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $160 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $130. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you at $120, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to sell it to you.",120.0,Alice,7,
