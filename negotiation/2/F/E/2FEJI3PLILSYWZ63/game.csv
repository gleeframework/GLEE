"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still leaves you a good profit.  Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. What do you think is the maximum you're willing to pay?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is a fair offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $895,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",895000.0,Alice,7,
