Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm asking for $1,100,000, which reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage.  You should aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than your guaranteed sale price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  This strategy increases the likelihood of securing a deal above Bob's initial valuation. 
* **Confident Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as fair, potentially swaying Bob's perception."
