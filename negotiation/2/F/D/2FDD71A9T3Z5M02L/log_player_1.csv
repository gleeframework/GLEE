Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate makes him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit, and you have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially reaching a price you're both happy with.

**Remember:** If Bob rejects your offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,350,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still willing to hold out for a better deal.  There's a good chance Bob will come up a bit more in the next round, and I'd rather not settle for less than I can potentially get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,300,000 is my absolute bottom line.  This still gives you a great deal, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'm starting to think about buying from John, though... 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a stalemate, and I might not be able to get a better deal. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, which is a much safer and more profitable option."
