"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle for $15,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
