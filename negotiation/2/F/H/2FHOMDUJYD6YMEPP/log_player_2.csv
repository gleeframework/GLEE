"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. I think you'll really love it!

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual value, it's still above your maximum budget.  You can do better. By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know what you think!

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's closer, but I can still do better.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for both of us. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice is firm on her price.  I've already established that I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, and Alice has rejected it.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a deadlock, and I risk losing out on the product entirely.  Instead, I'll go with the guaranteed deal from John."
