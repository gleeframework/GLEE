"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  I'm confident Bob will at least counteroffer, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still holding out for a price that is closer to what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also confident that the product is valuable enough that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit further. There's still a good chance he'll come up in price, and I don't want to settle for less than I can potentially get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

I'm dropping my price a little more, but I'm still keeping it above Bob's last offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. At this point, I'm getting a little nervous, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'm still hoping for a bit more, I'm getting close to the end of the rounds. Bob's offer is only $200 away from what John is offering, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's time to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
