Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **My minimum:** I'm comfortable selling to John for $15,000, so this is my lower limit.
* **Bob's value:** I know Bob values the product at $10,000, so I want to offer a price that's attractive to him but still profitable for me.
* **Negotiation room:**  A price of $12,500 gives Bob a good discount from my ""fallback"" price with John, making him more likely to accept. It also allows for some potential negotiation if he counters. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
