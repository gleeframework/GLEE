"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my value and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price.
