"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, there's still room for negotiation.  Since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my value and the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what John would charge, but it's a significant drop from her initial price. This represents a reasonable compromise.  While there's always a chance you could negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or Alice getting more stubborn outweighs the potential of saving an extra $75,000.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
