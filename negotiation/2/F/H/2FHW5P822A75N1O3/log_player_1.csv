{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really like it! My price is $115. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially gets Bob interested in buying.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if he rejects, but ultimately, John's offer of $120 gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could sell to him and get something, I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll counter-offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
