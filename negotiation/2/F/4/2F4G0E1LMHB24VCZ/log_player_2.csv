"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice.  It's worth $8,000 to her, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  Offering $9,500 is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than her asking price but also a reasonable price for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer was $11,000, and she's clearly willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer of $10,000 is a reasonable compromise that still allows Alice to make a profit while getting you closer to your desired price."
