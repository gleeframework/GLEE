Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value the product holds for Bob while still ensuring a substantial profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer I made.  I believe I can push for a higher price, and $950,000 is not enough to justify accepting and forgoing the potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. It's still a good profit for me, but also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a decent compromise. It's a good profit for me, and while it's not my ideal price, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  It's time to secure the sale."
