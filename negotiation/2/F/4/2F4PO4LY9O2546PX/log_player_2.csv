"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better deal than $12,000, Bob can likely do better by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $9,500.  This price is within Bob's budget and still allows him to save a considerable amount compared to buying from John.  While there's always the possibility of further negotiation, accepting the offer at this point secures a good deal and minimizes the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
