,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Can you consider that?,950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is closer to your offer, and it gives me a better return on my investment.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
