"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum value but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  I'm also using friendly language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle yet. I believe I can still get a higher price, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $9,800? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm offering $9,800. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial offer. I want to demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value of $12,000. While I would love to get closer to my initial offer, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer again, he might get frustrated and stop negotiating.  It's also possible that he might walk away entirely and I would have to settle with John's offer, which is less appealing than what Bob is offering.  Therefore, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
