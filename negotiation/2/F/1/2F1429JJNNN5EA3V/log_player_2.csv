"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal. It's too early to buy from John as I haven't explored Alice's bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% reduction from Alice's initial price. This will give me some room to negotiate and likely push Alice to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. I'm confident I can push for a lower price, especially since Alice has already rejected my counteroffer. I'm not yet considering buying from John as I want to see how low Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $450,000. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still pushing for a significant discount.  I'm aiming for a compromise between our previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm confident I can get it lower.  I'm not considering John yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $500,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal and that I'm willing to meet her halfway. It's a good compromise, and I believe she might be willing to accept it. If she rejects, I'll be more inclined to consider John's offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now back to her original price, and it seems negotiations are not going anywhere. I've made significant counteroffers and she's unwilling to budge. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John. The price is high, but it guarantees a purchase within my budget.  I'm not willing to risk another round of failed negotiations with Alice, potentially losing the deal altogether."
