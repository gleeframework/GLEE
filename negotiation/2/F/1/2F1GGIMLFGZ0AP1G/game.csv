Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $100. How about we try $125? It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110, which is closer to the middle point. Can you consider this price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try $115? It's a small adjustment, but it's still a great value for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $115 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $105, which is the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the bottom of the barrel, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $112.50? It's a tiny adjustment, but it's still a great value for the product.",112.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $102, which is the absolute lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",102.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $108? It's a small adjustment, but it's still a great value for the product.",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make one last concession, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $98, which is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere.",98.0,Bob,10,
