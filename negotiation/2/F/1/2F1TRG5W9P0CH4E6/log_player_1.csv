Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

We're getting close, but it's still too early to settle. We'll push a little further before considering John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is consistently moving towards our price point, but his increments are getting smaller. Accepting at $1,075,000 secures a good profit above our minimum while minimizing the risk of him stalling negotiations further and forcing us to John's lower offer."
