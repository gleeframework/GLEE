"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you can expect. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $850,000 is still above John's standing offer of $800,000. It makes more sense at this point to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John to secure the best price."
