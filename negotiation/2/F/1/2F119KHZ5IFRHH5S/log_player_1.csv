Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
