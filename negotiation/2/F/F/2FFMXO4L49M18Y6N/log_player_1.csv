Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** You need to sell the product for at least $150 to match John's offer.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $120.
* **Negotiation:**  Offering the product between $120 and $150 creates a potential win-win. Bob gets a product he values for a price lower than your minimum, and you earn more than Bob's perceived value.

**The offer of $135 is strategic because:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** It's slightly above what Bob thinks it's worth, encouraging him to consider it a ""deal.""
* **Below Your Minimum:** It leaves you room to potentially negotiate down a little further if Bob hesitates, while still staying above your guaranteed sale price to John."
