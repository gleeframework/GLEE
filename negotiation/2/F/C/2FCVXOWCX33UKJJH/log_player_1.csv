Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** A friendly and encouraging message can help Bob feel more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving the door open:** By saying ""Let me know what you think,"" I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer and continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my $15,000 minimum as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low. If the negotiation stalls, I can always go with John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss for me. I am willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price. 

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's $9,000 but lower than my initial $12,000 offer. This will show Bob that I'm open to negotiation while still trying to secure a better deal for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Fair value:** I'm presenting $10,500 as a ""fair compromise"", appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly, hoping to keep the negotiation open and avoid an impasse.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price point that's closer to my desired $15,000, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable. This counteroffer gives me a chance to see if we can reach a deal without having to go back and forth too many times."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However,  $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This price is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss. I am willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my desired price point.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's $9,500, but still lower than my previous offer of $10,500. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a better deal for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and we're getting closer! While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. This price is fair and reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to avoid a breakdown in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to see the benefit of a deal.
* **Urgency:** I suggest finalizing the deal, subtly increasing the pressure on Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $15,000, but still within a range that Bob might find acceptable. This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options more carefully and possibly move towards selling to John."
