Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $10,000, but this doesn't directly influence your initial offer. You're aiming for the highest possible price.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer of $19,000 sets an anchor. Even if Bob doesn't accept this price, it sets the stage for negotiation and makes a slightly lower counter-offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, guaranteeing you'll get at least $15,000. This allows you to be bolder in your offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the initial price, you can always lower it, staying above your minimum of $15,000."
