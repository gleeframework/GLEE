"Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I think my product is a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're both willing to compromise. I still believe a price closer to $1,000,000 is fair, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. I'm confident we can close a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I still think $1,050,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $1,087,500. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",1087500.0,Alice,7,
