"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I think my product is a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I still think $1,050,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $1,087,500. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is getting very close to my target.  Considering we only have a few rounds left, it's likely I won't be able to get a significantly lower price from Alice.  Accepting this offer saves me a substantial amount of money compared to buying from John."
