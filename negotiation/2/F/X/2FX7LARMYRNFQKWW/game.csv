"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? I believe this price is fair considering the value you've placed on the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $775,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $800,000. That's my bottom line, and it's a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
