# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1200000. It's a significant value for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. There's a significant difference between Alice's offer and your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price still represents a substantial value for you, and it's a reasonable starting point for a final agreement. Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, which is a good sign. However, you still have room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price point of $950,000 before considering buying from John."
