,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my best price for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential savings you'll get from a quick sale.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting closer, Bob. I can see that you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price that makes this deal work for me.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that we're both close to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to sell to John. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, Bob.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $987,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that's closer to your bottom line, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal now.",987500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $987,500, Bob. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1,020,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to go, and I expect you to accept it.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
