Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and inviting in my message to establish a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to meet him in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not quite there.  I'm hoping that another round of negotiation will get us to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer, but $95 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can we meet at this price?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm close to a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation when I can get my minimum price from John right now."
