"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price. You've already established a ceiling of $1,000,000 for yourself, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, especially since you have a solid fallback option with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $1080000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

At this point, Alice is only willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is still above your maximum budget.  It's time to take the safe option and buy from John for $1,000,000 to ensure you get the product within your desired price range.  You've already established John as a reliable alternative, and further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a better result."
