Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll be ready to adjust based on Bob's response, but I want to see how interested he is in the product first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,500. This is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to compromise.  I hope this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob and we can find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum, and I'm starting to feel like he's not serious about negotiating.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's not the highest price I was hoping for, but it's more than Bob is offering and it secures a sale without further negotiation."
