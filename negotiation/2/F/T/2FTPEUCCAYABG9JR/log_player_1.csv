{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  This product is highly sought after and I know it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation without scaring him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting high leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still well above your minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Highlighting the product's desirability and the limited-time offer adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Why not go higher?**
Pushing closer to $1,500,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer outright.  You have a strong fallback with John at $1,200,000, so it's best to aim for a price that is both appealing to Bob and highly profitable for you."
