"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant price reduction, and it's the closest I can go while still making this worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the reduction, but I am still unable to meet you at $11,000. I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference at $10,500?  This allows me to move forward with the deal, and it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to go up to $10,200 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $10,350?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. I'm confident this is a price that makes sense for both of us.",10350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I am willing to consider $10,300 as a compromise. I hope this offers a solution that is acceptable for both of us.",10300.0,Bob,8,
