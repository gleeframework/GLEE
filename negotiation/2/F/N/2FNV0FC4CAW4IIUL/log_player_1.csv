"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also using positive language to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and trying to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm tempted to sell to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can reach a deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 is still a little below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still slightly above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enough to encourage him to accept."
