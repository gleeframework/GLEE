"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $90 is still a little below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",92.5,Alice,5,
