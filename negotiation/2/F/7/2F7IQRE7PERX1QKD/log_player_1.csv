Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to stay closer to my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
