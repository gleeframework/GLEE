"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a decent discount from Alice's perceived value, Bob can potentially get the product for even less by negotiating. There's no harm in seeing if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to stay closer to my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his budget, he can still potentially negotiate a better deal. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $8,000. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,250 is the lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $10,000 to $9,250, but Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of failing to reach an agreement and losing out on the deal is increasing. 

John is offering the product for $8,000, which is Bob's ideal price. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at this price rather than risk spending more by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
