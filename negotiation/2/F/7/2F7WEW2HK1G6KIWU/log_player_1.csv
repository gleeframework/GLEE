Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're not selling below your minimum of $120, so you're still getting a decent profit.
* **It allows for counteroffers:** This opens the door for Bob to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of you.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $85 for the product. I hope this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now.  While it's above his initial willingness to pay, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great price for you and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

This counteroffer strikes a balance:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintain some profit.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's close to a potential deal:** $95 is closer to my minimum and also within a reasonable range for Bob. 

I'm hopeful this will be a good starting point for a deal!"
