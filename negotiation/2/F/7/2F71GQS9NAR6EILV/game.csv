"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm getting close to my target, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,,
