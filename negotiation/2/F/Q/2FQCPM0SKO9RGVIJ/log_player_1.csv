Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum value of $100. It leaves room for negotiation while still offering a decent profit margin."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
