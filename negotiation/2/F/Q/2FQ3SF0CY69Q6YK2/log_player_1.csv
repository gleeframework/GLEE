While Bob might eventually be willing to pay more than $12,000, his incremental increases are getting smaller. It's clear he's trying to get the best possible deal.  At this point, the additional profit from continuing the negotiation with Bob is likely not worth the time and effort, especially when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000."
