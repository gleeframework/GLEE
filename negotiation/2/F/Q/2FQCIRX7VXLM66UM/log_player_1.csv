Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to make a counter-offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  You signal that you're willing to be flexible and hear Bob's perspective, making him more likely to engage.
* **Alternative Option:**  While not explicitly stated, implying that you have other options (""list it publicly"") creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act. 

By setting the initial price at $15,000, you aim to:

1.  **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, you earn $3,000 more than your minimum.
2.  **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  You can always lower the price during the negotiation if needed, ensuring you don't leave money on the table."
