"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to make a counter-offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal you're not willing to pay that much and open the door for a counter-offer closer to your desired price range."
