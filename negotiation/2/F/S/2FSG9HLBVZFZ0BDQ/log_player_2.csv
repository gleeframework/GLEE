"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'll sell it to you for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000. Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000. This means there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer.  You can get the same product for the same price from John.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
