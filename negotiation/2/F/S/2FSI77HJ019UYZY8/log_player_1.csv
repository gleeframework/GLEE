Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly.
* **Justification:**  While brief, mentioning ""value"" plants the seed in Bob's mind that the product is worth the higher asking price. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Mentioning a public listing subtly implies you have other options, increasing the perceived value and potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price $5,000 above your minimum gives you space to potentially negotiate down while still securing a profit."
