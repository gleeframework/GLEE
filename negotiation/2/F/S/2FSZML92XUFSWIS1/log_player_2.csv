"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $120.
* Alice is offering the product for $100.
* You can get the product from John for $120.
* Since Alice's offer is better than John's, but you can get it for even cheaper (by rejecting Alice's offer and then buying it from John for $120), it's best to reject the offer."
