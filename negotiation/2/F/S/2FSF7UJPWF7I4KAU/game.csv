"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly lower than its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $7,000 is too far off.  I could consider $9,500, but that's my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
