Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial and $7,000 is too far off.  I could consider $9,500, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum price.  You're guaranteed the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
