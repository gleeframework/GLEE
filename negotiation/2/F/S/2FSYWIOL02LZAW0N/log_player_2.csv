"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above your maximum price of $120. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed to buy from John for $120, which is your upper limit."
