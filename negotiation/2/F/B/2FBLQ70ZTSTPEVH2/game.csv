"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $20,000 is already a very competitive price for this product. I could come down to $18,000, which is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $16,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,4,
