"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $150 to $120, and now you're asking for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. Let's close this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I need to make a bit more. How about we compromise at $108?",108.0,Alice,5,
