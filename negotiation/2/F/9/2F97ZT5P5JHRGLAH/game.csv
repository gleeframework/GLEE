"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's market value.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget constraints.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  This allows you to earn a profit while ensuring I get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
