"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,500. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the product's market value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That reflects its worth while acknowledging your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  This allows you to earn a profit while ensuring I get a good deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  While I could counter again, it's risky. Accepting his $9,000 offer is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $10,000."
