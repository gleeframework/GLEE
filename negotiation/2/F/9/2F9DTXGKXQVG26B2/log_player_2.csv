"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your maximum price and even above her stated value. It's clear there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need a more realistic price. How about we start at $5,000?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum price ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help me understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she outright rejects it, I know I need to move closer to my maximum. 
* **Psychological Advantage:**  While a very low offer might seem aggressive, it sets the tone that I'm a serious buyer but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still above your maximum price and her claim that this is her ""final offer"" should be treated cautiously at this stage. There's a chance she might be bluffing to try and pressure you. You're better off countering again, but moving closer to your limit to signal your interest while also keeping the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to offer $6,500.  This is a fair offer considering the value it holds for me."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up, But Strategically:**  I'm increasing my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious, but staying well below her $9,000 and my $8,000 maximum. 
* **Justification:** By referencing the value ""for me"" I'm subtly reminding Alice that her $10,000 valuation might not be the absolute measure.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves some space for one more round of negotiation if Alice is still firm. If she rejects it, I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John for $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,500. This is a good compromise, considering the value I have in the product and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice's offer of $7,500 is a great price, saving you $500 compared to John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away. The current offer represents a good balance of risk and reward.
* **Limited Time:**  In a real-world scenario, there might be other potential buyers. Accepting this good offer secures the deal."
