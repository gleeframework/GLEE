"I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $8,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but I'd need a more realistic price. How about we start at $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is my final offer, so I'd appreciate it if you could consider it carefully.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for me. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to offer $6,500.  This is a fair offer considering the value it holds for me.",6500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $7,500. This is a good compromise, considering the value I have in the product and the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make a deal.",7500.0,Alice,5,
