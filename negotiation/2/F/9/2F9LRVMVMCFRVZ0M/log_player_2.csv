"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that I believe will be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm sure you've heard about the incredible potential of this product, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is full of praise for the product, it doesn't change the fact that she's offering it at your maximum price. You have nothing to lose by rejecting her offer. You can always buy from John at the same price, or try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
