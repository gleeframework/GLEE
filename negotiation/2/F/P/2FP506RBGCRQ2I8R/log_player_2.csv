"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's true value, it's still above Bob's budget. There are still rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $9000? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, as there are more rounds available. It's worth attempting to find a more mutually acceptable price point before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8750.  This would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's meet at $9250. This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to your offer than my last one. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9250 is still outside Bob's budget of $8,000. While there are still rounds left, the negotiation is getting close to the deadline, and there is a risk that the negotiation might stall. Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with, and it avoids potentially losing out on the product altogether."
