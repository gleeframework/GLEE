Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point, as I don't know anything about Bob or the product's perceived value. Offering $20,000 is a good starting point as it's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 

Let me know Bob's response so we can continue the negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. $10,000 is far below my minimum of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  It's also a good starting point for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $16,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still being above my minimum and closer to a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I've reached a point where I'm not sure further bargaining will get me a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
