"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than $7500. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8200. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. I'm trying to be fair, but I really need to stay within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8100. It's a good compromise considering the value it brings to you.",8100.0,Alice,5,

I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $10000 if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go.,7800.0,Bob,6,
