"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer but still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
