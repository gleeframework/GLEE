Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Create Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (slightly):** While unlikely, starting slightly below $120 leaves a tiny bit of room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially increasing my profit marginally.

**Important:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for my minimum acceptable price."
