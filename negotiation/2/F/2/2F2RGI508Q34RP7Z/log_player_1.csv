Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $12,000?**  This price is a compromise. It's higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($10,000), but lower than what you'd get from John ($15,000). This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still getting a decent price. 
* **The risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, you are guaranteed to sell the product to John for $15,000. However, by offering a lower price, you have a chance to make the sale sooner and potentially avoid any delays or uncertainties associated with selling to John."
