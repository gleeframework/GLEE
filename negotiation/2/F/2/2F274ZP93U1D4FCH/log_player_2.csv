"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $120. I think it's a fair deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's significantly more than your $80 limit and leaves no room for negotiation.  It's time to counter with a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($60 vs. $120) leaves room for negotiation and gauges Alice's willingness to bargain. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite to maintain a positive tone but clearly states your price limit.
* **Strategic Goal:** The goal is to move the negotiation closer to your $80 limit while still leaving you the option to walk away and buy from John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met you halfway, but the price is still above your $80 limit. While $90 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer ($90) and your previous offer ($60) but skews slightly in your favor.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""ready to buy right now,"" you add a bit of pressure and signal that this is a serious offer.
* **Close to Your Limit:** $75 keeps you comfortably below your $80 limit, maximizing your potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can give it to you for $85, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that $85 is her final offer. While this is close to your $80 limit, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $80. It makes more sense to go with the guaranteed lower price, even if it means a slightly less exciting negotiation."
