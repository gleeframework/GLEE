"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $12000. I can offer it to you for $16000, which is a compromise from my original price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
