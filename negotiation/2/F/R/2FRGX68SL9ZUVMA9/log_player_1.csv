Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the value I place on this product and the fact I can get it elsewhere for $1,200,000, I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,150,000. This allows for a decent profit for you and secures a great deal for me. Let's close this deal!
