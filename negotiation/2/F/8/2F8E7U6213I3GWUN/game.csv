"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 to me. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering its value and the opportunity it presents, I am offering it to you for $120. This price reflects the balance between its worth to me and its perceived value to you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",120.0,Alice,1,
