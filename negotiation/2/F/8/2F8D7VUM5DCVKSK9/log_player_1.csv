Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's a significant discount from your minimum price:** This makes it more appealing to Bob and shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's above Bob's estimated value:** This gives you some room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps ensure a smooth start to the negotiation.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response and how determined you are to sell to him rather than John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While you want to sell the product, you're not desperate.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to make a counteroffer that is more in line with your minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I'm sticking to my budget. Would you consider $700,000? It's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still significantly below your minimum price, and while $700,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still not close enough.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is closer to your minimum. You still have the option to sell to John if Bob continues to be unreasonable."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $700,000 is simply not feasible for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
