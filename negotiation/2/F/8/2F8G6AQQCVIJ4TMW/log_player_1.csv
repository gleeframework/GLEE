{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it!  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Below your minimum:** It ensures you're still getting a profit.
* **Reasonable:** It's not an overly aggressive opening that might scare him off immediately. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $80 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but $95 is my lowest.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my offer and coming down to $95. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price.  I'm not willing to drop that low yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $85. I'm still a bit too high for that price.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  Let me know if that sounds good to you!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $87 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn, and his offers are still too low. It's not worth continuing the negotiation with him. I'd rather sell the product to John for $120 and avoid further haggling."
