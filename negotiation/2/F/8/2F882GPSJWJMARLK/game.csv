Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a good start, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10500?  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $11250.  How about we split the difference and go with $10875?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident this is a product I'd be very happy with.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go down to $10875. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller step back and offer it to you for $11375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11375 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $11000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11000 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm really trying to make this work, so how about we meet in the middle at $11125?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",11125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11125 is still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,9,
