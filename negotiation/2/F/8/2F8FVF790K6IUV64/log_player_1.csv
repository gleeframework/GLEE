"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting high, but within reason.  I want to see if Bob is willing to bite, but I'm also leaving room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counter his offer and try to push for a price closer to what I want.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting a significant compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it still allows you to make a good profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to close the deal and get my $1,500,000."
