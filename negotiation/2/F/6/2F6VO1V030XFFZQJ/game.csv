"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is considerably below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,000,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $925,000.  This is my final offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,
