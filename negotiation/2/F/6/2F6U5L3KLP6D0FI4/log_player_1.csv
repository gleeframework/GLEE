Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is lower, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 signals you're open to discussion but still value the product highly.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value and potential"" aims to frame the offer attractively to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.
* You have a strong fallback position with John, giving you leverage in the negotiation.
* Gauge Bob's reactions and adjust your approach accordingly."
