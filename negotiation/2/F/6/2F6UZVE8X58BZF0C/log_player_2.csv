"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, you know you have a backup option at $15,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice or see if she'll lower her price further."
