"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on the product, and it's closer to my desired price point.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's right at your value point and within my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",15000.0,Bob,4,
