Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** You leave room for negotiation and still allow Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is brief and focuses on the value proposition for Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds and continue the negotiation from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $90?  That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you'd prefer to get closer to $100, accepting Bob's offer of $90 is a good move. Here's why:

* **You're above your minimum:**  $90 is still significantly more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's likely a fair compromise:** Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum, and you're likely to get a better price than John would offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob backing out or getting into a long, drawn-out process.

Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal quickly and confidently."
