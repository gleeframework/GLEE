"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I can assure you it's worth at least $800000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $900000, which I believe reflects its potential value. If you're interested in exploring this further, please let me know and we can discuss the details.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you if possible.
