"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product of significant value.  While I can't disclose specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm willing to part with it for $1500000.  This is a fair price considering its potential.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your willingness to negotiate,  $1200000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This reflects the significant value of this product and gives you a good opportunity to acquire something truly special.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiations.  However, $1250000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
