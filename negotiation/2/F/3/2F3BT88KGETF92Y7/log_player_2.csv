# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a deal with you - I'll sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you is $800,000. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?
