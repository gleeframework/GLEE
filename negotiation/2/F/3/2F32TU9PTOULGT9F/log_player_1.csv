Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150, the goal is to get as much as possible from Bob first.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($150) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **""Stealing"" Narrative:**  Phrases like ""a steal"" aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal, even though the price is significantly higher than his perceived value."
