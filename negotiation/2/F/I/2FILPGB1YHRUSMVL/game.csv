"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but $120 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125, which is my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
