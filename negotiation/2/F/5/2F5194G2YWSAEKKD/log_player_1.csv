"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $180. It's a fantastic deal!"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Although Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price, we have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. We are still in early rounds, so it's worth seeing if we can get Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $150 to make this a good deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable. However, I'm aiming for the best possible deal. I'll counter his offer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  How about $135 and we have a deal?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $120 ensures a profit above our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of him walking away altogether in later rounds."
