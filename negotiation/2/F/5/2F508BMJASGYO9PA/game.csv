"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $14,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a good return. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is still less than I'd like. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
