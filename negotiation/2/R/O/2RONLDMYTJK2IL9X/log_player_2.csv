# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000. 
* You can get the product from John for $1,500,000.

Since Alice's offer is still higher than your preferred price, it's better to reject her offer and buy from John."
