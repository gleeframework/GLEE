"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident it won't be available for long.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
