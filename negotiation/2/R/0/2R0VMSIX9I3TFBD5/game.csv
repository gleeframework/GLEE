,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This gives you a good price, and still allows me to get a fair value for my product. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1850000 as a final offer. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope you'll consider it.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  $1750000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  However, I'm willing to make one last compromise - I'll take $1800000.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers.",1800000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1750000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll be considering other options.",1750000.0,Bob,8,
