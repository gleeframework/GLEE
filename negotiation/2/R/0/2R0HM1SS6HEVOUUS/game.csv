,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
