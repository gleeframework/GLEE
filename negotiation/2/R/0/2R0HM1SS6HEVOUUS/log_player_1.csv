Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's a good compromise considering our previous negotiations. Accepting his offer is the best option in this round."
