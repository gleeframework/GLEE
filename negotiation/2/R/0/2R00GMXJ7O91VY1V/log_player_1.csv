"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. It's a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This will give me a good starting point to see how much leverage I have in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round and see if we can close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob is interested in the product and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,600. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,100. While it's still a bit below what I initially hoped for, it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for $8,000 is too high. It's time to secure the deal."
