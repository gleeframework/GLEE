Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's always good to start with a price higher than his valuation. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives the deal as valuable.
* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** The price of $125 ensures that even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you'll still make a profit above your minimum of $150.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. This knowledge empowers you to aim for a higher price with Bob, as you don't risk losing the sale entirely."
