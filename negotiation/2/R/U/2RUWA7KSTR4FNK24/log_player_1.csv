Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it won't be available for long. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message doesn't sound like an ultimatum. It invites Bob's thoughts, making him more likely to engage in negotiation even if he finds the initial price high.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. This offer allows you to:

* **Maximize profit:** If Bob accepts, you get a $400,000 profit.
* **Negotiate strategically:**  If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, knowing your baseline is $800,000 from John."
