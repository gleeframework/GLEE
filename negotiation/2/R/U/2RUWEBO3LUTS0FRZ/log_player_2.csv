That's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $800,000.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at that price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You'll save $10,000 by going with John."
