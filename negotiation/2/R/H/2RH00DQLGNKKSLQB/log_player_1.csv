Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Fairness:** $120 is still less than the product's worth to Bob ($150), making the offer seem reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price and willing to negotiate. This encourages Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer of $100 is still significantly lower than the product's worth to him ($150).  There's still room for negotiation and potential to get a better price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and shows Bob I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Balancing Risk:** While $100 is a decent profit, the risk of selling to John for $80 is still lower than accepting a price that might be too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $110. This price is still fair for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $100 and my previous offer of $120. This shows willingness to negotiate and makes it more likely for Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $110 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring I make a decent profit. 
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, creating a more collaborative atmosphere for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Acceptable:**  $90 is just $10 below my minimum acceptable price of $80. This is a good profit margin considering the potential risk of selling to John for $80.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. It's unlikely he'll get much lower than $90, and continuing to negotiate could risk him walking away completely.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer saves time and avoids further negotiation rounds.

While $90 isn't my ideal price, it's a decent compromise that balances profit and risk."
