"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to negotiate a higher price, $11,500 is still below your maximum budget of $12,000. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
