"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up.",12500.0,Alice,1,
