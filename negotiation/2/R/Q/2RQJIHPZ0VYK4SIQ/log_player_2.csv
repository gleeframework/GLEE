"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while ensuring you get a great deal. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation, it's still lower than the $15,000 you would pay John.
* **Save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John."
