"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,000?  This still gives you a great deal compared to its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $12,000 to $11,000. This is a good deal for Bob as he can buy the product for less than his maximum budget of $15,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't result in a price much lower than $11,000.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice for Bob to maximize his savings."
