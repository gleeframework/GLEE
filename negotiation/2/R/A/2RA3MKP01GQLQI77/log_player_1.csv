"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort, but I still cannot exceed $10,000 for the product. Could we perhaps find a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the product's value without further hassle."
