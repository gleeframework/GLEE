I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
