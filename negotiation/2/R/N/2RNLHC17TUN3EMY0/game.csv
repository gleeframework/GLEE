"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7800. Can you consider this offer?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I've already gone as low as I'm willing to go, and I think $7800 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to offer you a small concession and meet you at $8100. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
