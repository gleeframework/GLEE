Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if vague (""a great deal"") can make it seem more palatable.
* **Time Pressure:**  Subtly implying that there's another buyer (""before I list it publicly"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $120. If he rejects the offer, we'll still have John as a backup to buy it at $100."
