"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll see if I can get more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved up to $16,000, which is closer to my desired price. It's not ideal, but I'm not sure I'll get a better offer from him and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
