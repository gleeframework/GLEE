"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $105. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,5,
