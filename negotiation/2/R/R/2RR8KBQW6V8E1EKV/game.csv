"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $912500. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again if needed.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.
