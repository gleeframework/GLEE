"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still above my maximum.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering what the product is worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob seems firm on his valuation, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
