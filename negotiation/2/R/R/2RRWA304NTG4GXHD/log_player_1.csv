Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a high price initially, as I don't know Bob's value for the product.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to compromise.  If he still rejects, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and closer to my ideal price.  I'm going to accept it and avoid further negotiation."
