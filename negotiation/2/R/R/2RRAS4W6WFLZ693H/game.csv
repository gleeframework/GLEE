"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you have budget constraints, but I'm afraid $950000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My next offer is $1200000 is my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll meet you at $1150000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go much lower than $1150000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target.

"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll meet you at $1100000. This is my last offer before I start to consider other options. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep negotiating at this price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1100000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to meet my minimum target. I'm afraid I'm going to have to stop negotiating at this point. I'm willing to sell the product to you at $1100000, but I need a firm commitment from you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.
