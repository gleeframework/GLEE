"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $12,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,250. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial. How about $13,000?  That's a good compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
