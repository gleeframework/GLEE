Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for a quality item."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us a chance to lower the price slightly and still stay above our minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, ensuring we won't be forced to go below $120.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while having a guaranteed sale to John as backup."
