Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob is key to maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Knowing the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), the offer is set significantly below that but well above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a substantial gain if accepted. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value."
