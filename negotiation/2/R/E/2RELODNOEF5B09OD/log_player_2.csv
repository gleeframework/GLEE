"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I will pay $1,350,000, which is more than the $1,000,000 that Alice values the product at, so I won't make a profit. If I buy from John, I will pay $1,500,000, which is more than what Alice is asking for, but at least I will be buying the product at a price that is equal to its value to me. Therefore, I will reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
