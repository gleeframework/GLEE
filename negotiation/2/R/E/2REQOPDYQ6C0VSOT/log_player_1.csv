"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm confident you'll find highly valuable. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something truly unique.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value and uniqueness of the product to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which allows for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While his offer is low, there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I believe I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Moderate Adjustment:** I'm decreasing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for both of us. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can reach an agreement. I am proposing a price of $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation for the potential of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, it doesn't quite reflect its full potential value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This represents a significant opportunity for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like a fair deal.
* **Highlighting Opportunity:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a valuable opportunity for him, further encouraging him to accept.
* **Open Ended Question:**  I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, which encourages him to engage in the conversation and potentially make a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price that's slightly higher than my minimum, but still acceptable to Bob. I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, and I am willing to increase my offer to $1085000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Bob has increased his offer to $1,085,000, which is very close to my desired price range. 
* **Time Constraints:** With only four rounds remaining, the risk of continuing negotiation is higher. It's possible Bob could lower his offer again, or we could reach an impasse.
* **Secure Profit:**  Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit significantly higher than selling to John. 

While I'd ideally like to push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential gains in this scenario."
