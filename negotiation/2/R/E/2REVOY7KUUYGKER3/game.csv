"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. It's in great condition and you know it's worth $100 to you, so this is a fair price.  Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 still isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
