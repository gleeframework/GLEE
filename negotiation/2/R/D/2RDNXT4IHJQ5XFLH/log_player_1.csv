Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm asking for $20,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I provide a  justification by mentioning its ""significant worth"" and calling it a ""unique item"" and a ""valuable asset."" This framing aims to increase its perceived value to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell below that price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Ideal scenario, I maximize my profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** This opens the door for a discussion where I can potentially still sell above $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** I sell to John at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out."
