Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, meaning you'll still profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $9,500 is less than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, meaning he has room to negotiate if he wants to. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and ensuring Bob doesn't immediately walk away.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to try to push for a higher price. There's a good chance Bob is still willing to pay more, especially since he expressed initial interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm hoping we can settle on $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while also keeping my desired profit margin in mind. Hopefully, Bob will find this counteroffer acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price. There's still a chance Bob might be willing to come up a bit more, and I'm not ready to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

I've decided to make a final counteroffer. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it shows that I'm still flexible and willing to compromise. This price is still above my minimum and might be appealing to Bob, who's already shown a willingness to go up to $8,750."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can do $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has repeated his offer of $8,750.  While it's not ideal, it's close to my minimum and I'm concerned that another counteroffer might lead him to walk away.  It's better to secure the sale at this price rather than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower amount."
