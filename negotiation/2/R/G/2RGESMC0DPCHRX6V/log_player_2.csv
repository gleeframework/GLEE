"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to your business endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is less than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase from John for a price within your budget."
