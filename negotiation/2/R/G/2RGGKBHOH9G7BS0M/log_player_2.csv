"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a clear negotiating range and shows I'm serious about getting a better deal. It's likely Alice will reject this offer, but it will force her to counter with a lower price, giving us room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if I can get a better price closer to my maximum. I'll use the information from this offer to inform my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget but still too high. This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to pay more than my initial offer, but staying below my maximum. It's a reasonable middle ground that might encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly and is now within my maximum budget, it's still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer to see if I can get it down closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm willing to pay John's price, which is my maximum budget.  If Alice accepts, I get the product at my desired price. If she rejects, I'll buy from John, as I don't want to risk further negotiation and potential price increases."
