Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000.  This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also need to make the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit lower. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly is better than waiting for John, even if we get slightly less.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price and ensuring a successful sale."
