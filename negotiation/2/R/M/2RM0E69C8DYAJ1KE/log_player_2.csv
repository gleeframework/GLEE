"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation.  It shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better price.  $8,500 is a reasonable compromise, as it's still above Bob's maximum price and could be attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,750, which is within Bob's budget.  While he could try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and the negotiation could drag on.  Accepting the offer now secures the product and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
