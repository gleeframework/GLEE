"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth a significant amount to me, and I'm confident it has the potential to be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a price I'm comfortable with, considering its potential. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe you could maximize its value. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
