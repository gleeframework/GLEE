"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $900000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction.",950000.0,Alice,3,
