"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity for you, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial offer is $1000000.  This represents a significant value proposition for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim for a price closer to Alice's value of $800,000 to maximize savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $900,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $900000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and a good price for Bob. This price is still well below Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000 and is within a reasonable range for both parties.  It's unlikely Bob will be able to get a lower price without risking losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob."
