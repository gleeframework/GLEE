{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. It's worth a significant amount to both of us, at least $1,000,000.  To be fair and give you a chance to benefit from this unique opportunity, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** The product's high value to both parties allows for a higher initial offer.
* **Potential for Profit:** Aiming for $1,250,000 allows for a significant profit margin while staying within a reasonable range above Bob's perceived value.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, giving Alice leverage to negotiate from a position of strength. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer.
* Bob's risk tolerance and negotiation skills are unknown factors that could influence his decision."
