Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I appreciate the product's value, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to offer $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more affordable. Would you consider $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is incrementally increasing their offer.  There's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working to find a price that works. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to drop to $860,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal."",
""product_price"": 860000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but  $860,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle at $780,000? I think that's a very fair offer considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very close to John's offer, but we're still in a position to try and get a bit more.  We'll push slightly above John's price to test Bob's flexibility."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're really close, and I appreciate how we've worked together to reach this point. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a very similar price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can reach an agreement.  Would you consider $810,000? It's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 810000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** By slightly exceeding John's offer and presenting it as a final offer, we apply a bit of pressure while still allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a better deal than the ""other buyer."" This maximizes our chances of securing a sale above $800,000."
