"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price than $900,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? I'm confident this price is still attractive for you, while allowing me to get a fair return on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'll keep negotiating with Bob for now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's be realistic,  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had enough of this negotiation. Bob seems unwilling to go higher than $975,000, which is still significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get the value I deserve."
