"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It's a unique opportunity to own an item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. Given its importance and the benefits it offers, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This price reflects not only its current market value but also the potential long-term benefits you could derive from it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price or get the product closer to your desired price from John."
