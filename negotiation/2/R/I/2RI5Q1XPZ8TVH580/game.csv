"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. While $10,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to get the product for this price or I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,4,
