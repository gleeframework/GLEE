{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to secure a deal.  It's a good starting point, and I can adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better deal. I will counteroffer to see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500?  That way we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. That's a fair price and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm still hoping to get a better price, the negotiation has become increasingly difficult.  Bob's last offer is only $500 above my minimum.  It's time to secure the deal with John and avoid further risk of a lower price."
