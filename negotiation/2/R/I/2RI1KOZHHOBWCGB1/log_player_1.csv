Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's close to my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a good incentive to accept as he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it should still be attractive to Bob given he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a higher price, $132 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. There's a chance Bob will reject my counteroffer and I might end up with nothing, so I'll take the sure win."
