"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its worth and the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting the initial offer and attempting to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of $10,000. This demonstrates that he's serious about getting a deal, but also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will bring you even more value than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high for Bob, as he's aiming for a price closer to $10,500.  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $10,750?  This price is fair and allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a price that's closer to his desired price while still being a reasonable compromise. This shows that he's taking Alice's offer seriously and wants to reach an agreement.  By suggesting a split-the-difference approach, he's demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle."
