"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $15,000. This is to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value for the product.  It's important to establish a starting point that allows for negotiation but doesn't immediately make me look desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $15,000.  However, it's getting closer, so I'm going to try to get closer to my price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
``` 

I'm  offering a price of $15,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value. I hope this will entice Bob to accept and close the deal, as further negotiations could lead to selling the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price.  It's still more profitable for me to keep negotiating with Bob than to sell to John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15250}
``` 

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $15,250.  This is a further compromise but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation, and I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept.  We're running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm not happy to settle for $15,000, given that Bob is refusing to budge on his price, I'm starting to run out of rounds. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price, especially with John willing to pay my minimum value."
