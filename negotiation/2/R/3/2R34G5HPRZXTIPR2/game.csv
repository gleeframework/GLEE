"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to make a serious offer of $850,000,  which I believe is fair considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a valuable product, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I truly believe this product has the potential to be valuable. Let's see if we can close this deal at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
