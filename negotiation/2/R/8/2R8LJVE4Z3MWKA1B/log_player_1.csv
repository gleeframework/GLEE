Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible (her guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting Alice closer to her desired profit. 
* **Balance Confidence and Flexibility:** The message conveys that Alice believes in the product's value while still being open to negotiation.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000, so any price Bob accepts above that is a bonus."
