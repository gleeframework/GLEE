{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob without revealing too much information about my own valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a win-win scenario.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $14000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my ideal price point.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would result in a lower profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000. My counteroffer will be calculated based on the value I place on the product and my willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $14,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This price reflects the product's unique features and potential value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while staying firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits.
* **Openness:**  I use language that encourages continued discussion and a potential agreement.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our initial positions.  I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I might consider lowering my price further, but I'll also keep John as an option if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $14000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to propose $14200 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Gap:** The difference between Bob's offer ($14,200) and my desired price ($14,500) is now very small.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John at a much lower price.
* **Time Factor:** The negotiation process is taking time, and I need to consider the opportunity cost of delaying a sale.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to earn more, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical choice. It ensures a sale at a reasonable price and minimizes the risk of ending up with a much lower profit by selling to John or having the negotiation drag on indefinitely."
