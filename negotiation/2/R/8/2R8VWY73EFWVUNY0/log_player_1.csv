Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to be persuasive without seeming too aggressive. Highlighting the product's value to Bob justifies the price. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
