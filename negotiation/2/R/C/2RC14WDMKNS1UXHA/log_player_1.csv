Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price closer to $12000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. Although it's tempting,  I'm aiming for a price closer to $14,000 and want to see if I can get a better deal. I still have more rounds and don't want to settle for the minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit more.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  It's still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13500 is a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd be willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price and we're getting closer to the middle ground. It's important to remember that I still have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, so this is a good compromise."
