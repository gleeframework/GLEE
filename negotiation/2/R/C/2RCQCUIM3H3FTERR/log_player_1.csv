"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $220. I think it's a great deal for something of such high quality."", ""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $220 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is significantly lower than its actual value. How about we meet in the middle at $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $180 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his low offer.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation with him when I have a guaranteed offer of $150 from John."
