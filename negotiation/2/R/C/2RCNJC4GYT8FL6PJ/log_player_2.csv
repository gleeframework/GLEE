"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is within your budget, there's a chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to get a profit margin, and you have the option of buying from John for $150. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or resort to buying from John."
