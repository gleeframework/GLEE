"Thanks for your counter-offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer.",11200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's close this gap. Would $11,600 work for you? It's a small adjustment, but I think it's fair given the product's value.",11600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I still need to save some money. Would you be willing to go down to $11,400? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11400.0,Bob,6,
