"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the potential profit he can make.
* **Strategic Choice:** I'm not starting too low, as I want to maximize my earnings. However, I'm leaving room for negotiation to incentivize Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Strategic Choice:**  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal for me. I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay significantly more. I'm not going to settle for such a low price.
* **Next Steps:**  I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,300,000? This still gives you a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher than his initial proposal. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that I'm willing to compromise but still need to secure a reasonable price.
* **Strategic Choice:** I'm taking a measured approach, acknowledging Bob's position while trying to find a middle ground. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiations if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which still allows you a good profit and is a fair price considering the value for me. Let's find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Although it's an increase from his previous offer, it's not enough for me to consider accepting.
* **Strategic Choice:** I'm still holding out for a better deal, hoping to get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a strong alternative.
* **Next Steps:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, but I'm also closely considering selling to John as the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a satisfactory result yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to find a middle ground by suggesting a price that's closer to Bob's but still within my desired range. I'm also reminding Bob of the value he would be getting.
* **Strategic Choice:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution, hoping this offer will be tempting enough for Bob to accept.
* **Next Steps:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I will have to carefully consider if it's more profitable to sell to John or continue negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1150000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Strategic Choice:** The negotiations have reached a stalemate.  I'm not confident that Bob will agree to a price that's satisfactory to me, especially since he's already been hesitant to go much higher.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option at this point, ensuring I get the best possible return. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'm ending negotiations with Bob and moving forward with the sale to John."
