"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which is important for building trust."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $12,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $13,500 for this product. It's still a great price considering the value it holds. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $13,000. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. I'm willing to accept $13,000 as it's still a decent profit for me."
