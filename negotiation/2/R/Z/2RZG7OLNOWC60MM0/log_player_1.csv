{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for your business, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my initial offer. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to $1,400,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.

This would still give you a substantial return on your investment while ensuring I can get a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,350,000. I propose $1,325,000 as a compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm not willing to settle for $1,325,000 just yet, especially since I have a few more rounds to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,340,000. This is a fair price that balances both our needs. Let's close this deal and get this valuable product working for you."", ""product_price"": 1340000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer, and I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially with only a few rounds left. I'm not ready to settle for $1,330,000 yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've reviewed your latest offer, Alice. I am willing to pay $1,332,500 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,332,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob's offer is only $2,500 less than my last offer, and it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm taking this offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of selling to John for a much lower price."
