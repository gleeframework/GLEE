Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair deal that benefits us both. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By highlighting a ""special price"" and suggesting a ""fair deal,"" Alice subtly encourages Bob to accept quickly before he misses out. 

If Bob rejects this offer, Alice can always fall back on her guaranteed sale to John for $10,000."
