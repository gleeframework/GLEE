"Hi Alice,  $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115. Let's meet in the middle.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal!",120.0,Alice,5,
