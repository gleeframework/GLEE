"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $12,000. Let's work together to make this transaction beneficial for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm unable to match the full $14,000 asking price, I'm willing to consider a middle ground. How about we aim for $12,000 for the product? This brings us closer to your valuation while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",12000.0,Alice,3,
