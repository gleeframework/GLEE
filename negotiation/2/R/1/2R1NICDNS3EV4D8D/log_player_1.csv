Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! $14,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm unable to match the full $14,000 asking price, I'm willing to consider a middle ground. How about we aim for $12,000 for the product? This brings us closer to your valuation while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
