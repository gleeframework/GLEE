Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm unable to match the full $14,000 asking price, I'm willing to consider a middle ground. How about we aim for $12,000 for the product? This brings us closer to your valuation while still allowing me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.
