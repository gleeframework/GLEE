"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price.  $9,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,250? That's a fair price and allows both of us to get a good deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
