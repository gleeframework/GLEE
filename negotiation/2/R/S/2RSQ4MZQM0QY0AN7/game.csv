"Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest in the product, but your offer is significantly below its true market value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $2,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. To be transparent, my absolute minimum price for this product is $1,750,000. This is a firm offer and reflects the true value of what I'm offering.  Please consider it carefully.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your transparency on your minimum price.  While I understand its value, that figure is still outside my budget. I could potentially stretch to $700,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",700000.0,Bob,6,
