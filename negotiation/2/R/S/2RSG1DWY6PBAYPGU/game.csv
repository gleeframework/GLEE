"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $950,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
