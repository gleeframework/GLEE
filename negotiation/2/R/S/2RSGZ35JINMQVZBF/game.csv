"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900,000?  That's a significant savings for you, and it would be a great deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a significant concession, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
