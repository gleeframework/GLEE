"Alice, your product is interesting, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, which is still a good price for you, considering it's worth $800000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $825000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on.",800000.0,Bob,4,
