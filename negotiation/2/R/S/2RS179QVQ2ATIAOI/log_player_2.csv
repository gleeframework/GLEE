"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I believe this is a fair starting price for us both.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is above your maximum budget of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's room to try and lower the price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed option at your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a good price for you, considering it's worth $800,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $825000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** You have 7 rounds left and can potentially lower the price further.
* **Buying from John is still a good option:**  You can still get the product for your target price if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 800000}
