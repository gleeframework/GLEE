{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a valuable asset that's worth every penny, and I believe this is a fair starting price for us both.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, which is still a good price for you, considering it's worth $800000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $825,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly what the product is worth to me, and it's the same price John is willing to pay. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm not likely to get a better offer. I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
