"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a solution that works.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as it's getting very close to my minimum price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not at my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I need you to meet me there. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
