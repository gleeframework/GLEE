,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900000 is significantly below my minimum.  Let's find some middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
