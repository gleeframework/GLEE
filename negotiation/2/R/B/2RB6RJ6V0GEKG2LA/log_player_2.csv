"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to get the product for as low as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, which is $12,000. This counteroffer is a significant step towards that goal, offering a price close to Bob's maximum budget.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it establishes Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's preferred price of $12,000, but it's lower than her previous offer of $14,500.  At this point, it's a good compromise. Continuing negotiations might result in a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will stick to her $13,500 offer or even increase it again. It's a calculated risk, and in this case, accepting the offer seems like the best option for Bob."
