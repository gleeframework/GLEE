Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value but allows for potential negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a fair price that might encourage Bob to accept. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $125 is a good deal considering I could sell to John for $100. It seems like Bob is firm at $125, and continuing to negotiate might just waste time and ultimately lead to me selling to John for less."
