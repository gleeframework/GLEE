"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as you know the value is significantly higher.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can do better than $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $950000?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
$950,000 is a good price for you and allows you to save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting and then going to John is too high."
