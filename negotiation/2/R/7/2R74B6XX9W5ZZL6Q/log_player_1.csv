I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $1,500,000, giving Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a substantial profit.  I'll be prepared to counteroffer if he rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm still above my minimum value and hope this will entice Bob to accept."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating."

I'm counteroffering at $1,850,000.  This is a small drop from my previous offer but still above my minimum. I believe this shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal, but also keeps me within a range that I find acceptable."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's only $50,000 less than my previous counteroffer and a good deal considering I could sell to John for $1,500,000. I'd rather lock in a sale and secure a profit than risk further negotiation."
