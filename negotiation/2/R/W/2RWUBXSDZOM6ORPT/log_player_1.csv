Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a strong starting offer, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding the product's value to Bob.  It's important to start high to maximize your potential profit while still being within the realm of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than the product's worth to me. I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, or if not, I can always sell to John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is just too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $850,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $775,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, or I can always sell to John for $800,000.  I'll continue to try and reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $775,000 is still a bit too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal on track. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm getting close to my target price. How about we meet at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum price point.  While I'd love to get more, it's been a long negotiation and accepting his offer guarantees me a sale. I'm happy with this outcome."
