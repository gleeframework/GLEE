Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm very interested in the product and believe it could be beneficial for my business, but I'm only able to offer $950,000. This would still give you a good profit while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm confident this product can generate significant value for your business, which justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a substantial return on your investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a substantial profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I have several rounds left, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased with your continued willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, I need to stay closer to my original position.

This compromise demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your effort, $1,050,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and gives you a good profit margin. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to stay closer to my target price. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,040,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,032,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part and would still leave you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,032,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,032,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,032,500 is still less than my ideal price, I'm willing to accept this offer.  This is a good outcome considering it's above my minimum and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's also important to note that selling to John would result in a lower profit."
