"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a new proposal, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product's value is not quite as high as you're suggesting. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
