Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be particularly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have a safety net. You should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in his mind.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob and offering him a priority opportunity. This can make him more receptive even if the price is higher than he initially expected."
