"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is right at the midpoint between our last two offers. It's a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
