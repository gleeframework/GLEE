{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to potentially make a profit greater than selling to John.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob makes the offer more appealing and incentivizes him to consider it.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for potential counteroffers. 
* **Preparing for potential counteroffers:** I'm ready to counter Bob's offers while keeping my bottom line of $1,200,000 from John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on your investment while allowing me to secure the product within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit, and $950,000 is still below my minimum desired value of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I can counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially reaching a more favorable outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,200,000, aiming for a win-win situation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $975,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway from my initial offer to Bob's offer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I reiterate that I'm willing to negotiate but emphasize the value of the product to both of us. 
* **Compromise:**  $975,000 is a reasonable middle ground that could be agreeable to both parties.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary but also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your offer. However, I must respectfully decline at $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. This price still allows you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Goal:** While $960,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept a loss on this deal.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I still have John's offer as a backup, giving me bargaining power. I can continue negotiating with Bob to try and get a better price.
* **Counteroffer:** I can make a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's, aiming to close the gap without compromising my minimum profit.

**Next Steps:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to inch closer to my goal of $1,200,000 while acknowledging the value of a deal with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer to $965,000.  This represents a good compromise and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 965000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping the price by $5,000, showing flexibility while staying close to my desired profit.
* **Final Offer Appeal:**  I'm framing this as a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept and avoid risking losing the deal.
* **Win-Win Focus:** I emphasize the mutual benefit of the deal, highlighting that both of us can be happy with this outcome.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm ready to accept if Bob agrees, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've carefully considered our negotiations, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose $962,500 as a counteroffer. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will allow us to conclude this transaction successfully. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Goal:**  $962,500 is still significantly below my desired minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where the price difference is small, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a substantial increase for me.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000, ensuring a profit that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John is the most logical choice at this point. It provides a higher profit, eliminates further negotiation, and ensures a timely sale."
