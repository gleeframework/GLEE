"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value to us at $1,000,000. Given its importance to both of our businesses, I propose an initial offer of $950,000. This price reflects our commitment to fair trade while allowing us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's worth to you at $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would leave you with a substantial profit, while still allowing me to acquire the product at a favorable price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. While I'd like to accommodate your needs as much as possible, I must also ensure that our business interests are met. Therefore, I propose an adjusted offer of $875,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions, providing you with a more favorable deal than my initial offer while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
