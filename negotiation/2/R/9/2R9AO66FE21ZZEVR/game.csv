"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product presents a mutually beneficial opportunity, $900,000 is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $820,000. Let me know if that works for you.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $820,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle on $760,000? I feel that would be a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $810,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",810000.0,Alice,5,
