"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find common ground.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $105 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $107.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $107.50 is still a bit too low for me, though. How about we settle on $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. What do you say?",112.5,Alice,5,
