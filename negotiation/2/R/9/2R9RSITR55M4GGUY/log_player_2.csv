# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value is immense, and I believe it will be a game-changer for your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it would bring to my business."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I understand your position, but I'm still confident in its potential to benefit your business significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its quality and the potential return on investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice is coming down, but the price is still considerably higher than her own valuation. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer to that $1,000,000 mark, but I need to see a little more movement. How about $950,000? I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still doesn't cover the full value of the product.  However, to show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're getting very close, but I believe Alice might be willing to come down a little more. I'll risk another counteroffer."
