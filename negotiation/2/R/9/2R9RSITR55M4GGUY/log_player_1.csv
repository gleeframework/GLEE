Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it would bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
