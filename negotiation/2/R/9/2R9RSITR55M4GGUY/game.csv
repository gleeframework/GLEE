"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know its value is immense, and I believe it will be a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its quality and potential.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it would bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I understand your position, but I'm still confident in its potential to benefit your business significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering its quality and the potential return on investment.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm getting closer to that $1,000,000 mark, but I need to see a little more movement. How about $950,000? I'm confident this price is mutually beneficial.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 still doesn't cover the full value of the product.  However, to show my commitment to a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $975,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our needs. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close. This is a very fair offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Would you consider $960,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
