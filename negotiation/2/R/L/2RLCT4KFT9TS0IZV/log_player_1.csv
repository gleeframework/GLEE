Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 887500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $875000. How about we meet at $882500? I think that's a fair price for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $882,500 is now above my minimum desired price of $800,000.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and the risk of losing the deal entirely is increasing. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
