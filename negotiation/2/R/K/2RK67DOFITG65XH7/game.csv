"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",11250.0,Alice,3,
