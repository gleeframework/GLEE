"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent profit for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or switch to John who is offering a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
