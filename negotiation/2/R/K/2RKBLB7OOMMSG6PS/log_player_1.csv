Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving and generating significant revenue. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000.  I think it's a fair price that reflects its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price closer to your value ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. While Bob might not accept this, it gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob justifies the high price and shifts the focus away from your potential profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit for you even if Bob manages to bring the price down slightly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This approach assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If you know Bob to be particularly tough, you might adjust your initial offer slightly lower. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you're under time pressure to sell, a lower initial offer might be more appealing to ensure a quicker sale. However, with John as a guaranteed backup, you have leverage to aim high."
