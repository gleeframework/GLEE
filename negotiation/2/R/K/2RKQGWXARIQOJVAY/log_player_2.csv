Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product for you. Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer still gives you a significant benefit and allows us to reach an agreement.

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer, and it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, saving you $25,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
