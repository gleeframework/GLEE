"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I recognize the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product for you. Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer still gives you a significant benefit and allows us to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,
