``` 

This offer aims for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation.  By starting high, I can potentially secure a good price. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffers accordingly.  Remember, John is always a backup, ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I recognize the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While it's good to see that he recognizes the value of the product, his offer is simply too low. I will counter with a higher offer, trying to close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product for you. Let's compromise - I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This offer still gives you a significant benefit and allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you be willing to settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, aiming to close the gap and hopefully reach an agreement. If he rejects again, I'll go with John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
