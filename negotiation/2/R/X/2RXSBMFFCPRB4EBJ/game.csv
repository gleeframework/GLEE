"Alice, your product looks great, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle at $15,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $16,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",16250.0,Alice,5,,
