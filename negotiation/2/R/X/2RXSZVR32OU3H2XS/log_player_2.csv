"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than John's price of $1,200,000, you know the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice. This suggests there might be room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, you could potentially get Alice to lower the price further, saving you even more money."
