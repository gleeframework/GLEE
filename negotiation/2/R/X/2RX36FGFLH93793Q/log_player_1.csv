Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high asking price.
* **Confidence:**  The language used is confident and positions the product as something desirable, potentially encouraging Bob to meet the price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If negotiations fall through, you always have the safety net of selling to John for $800,000."
