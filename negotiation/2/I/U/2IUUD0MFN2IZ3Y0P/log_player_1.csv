"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident that this offer allows for a mutually beneficial outcome."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives you a better sense of Bob's willingness to pay.
* **Justifying the Price:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high asking price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it's not so outrageous as to be immediately rejected.  It leaves ample room for Bob to counter-offer and for you to strategically move closer to a price that works for both parties.
* **Considering the Alternative:**  You have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so any offer significantly below that would not be in your best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his counteroffer shows he's serious, you have room to negotiate. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is your safety net but settling too quickly might leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the proposed price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a figure closer to my initial ask. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** While Bob's offer was too low, you don't want to scare him off. By significantly decreasing your asking price, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and incentivize him to move closer to your desired range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** A price of $1,900,000 keeps you well above your minimum ($1,500,000) and gives you room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message directly addresses the discrepancy between his offer and the product's value, reiterating your position while encouraging continued discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I've considered your proposal and am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). While you could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
