Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We're aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum ($8,000) and close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum. 
* **Considering the Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John. This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit with Bob while having a safety net."
