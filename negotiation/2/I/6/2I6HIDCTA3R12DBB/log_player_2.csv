"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $14,000. This means you'll save $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting the offer is not optimal:** Rejecting the offer means you'll end up paying John $15,000. This is worse for you than accepting Alice's offer."
