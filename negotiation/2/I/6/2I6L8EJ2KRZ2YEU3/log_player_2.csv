"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $95 is too close to his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $85.  How about we split the difference and meet at $90? It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value, and it's a fair compromise for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is better than $95, it's still above his ideal price point.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $87? It's a fair compromise for both of us, and gets me closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I really value our negotiation and appreciate you coming up to $87. Let's see if we can find a happy medium.  How about $89? This would still be a great deal for you, and would get us closer to a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price.  $89 is within his budget, and only $1 more than his last counteroffer.  Accepting the offer keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John for a higher price."
