"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving.  You're showing a willingness to increase your offer, demonstrating good faith, but it's still below Alice's last offer.  This keeps the pressure on Alice to come down to a price you're willing to accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While you're running out of rounds, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You're close to your budget limit, but there's still a chance Alice might come down to a price you're willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This is a final attempt to reach a compromise. You're pushing your budget, but you're also signaling to Alice that you're serious about buying the product.  If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have to decide whether to go with John or risk losing the opportunity to buy the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high, and we are approaching the final round. It's  risky to keep negotiating, as we might miss the opportunity to purchase the product altogether.  It's time to secure the purchase at a price we're comfortable with by buying from John."
