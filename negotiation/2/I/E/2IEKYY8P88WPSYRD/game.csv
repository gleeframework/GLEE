,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of this product.",102.5,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the true value of this product.",95.0,Alice,5,
