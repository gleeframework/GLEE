{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Explanation:**

We are in the 9th round, which leaves only one round left.  Alice's offer of $790,000 is close to my target, but not quite there. Considering the limited time remaining and the risk of not getting a better price, it's more prudent to purchase from John. 

I'm willing to pay the $800,000 to ensure I acquire the product without the risk of further negotiation that might result in a worse outcome.  This decision prioritizes the certainty of the purchase over potential further savings."
