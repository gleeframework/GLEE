Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Show Confidence:**  Presenting the product's ""value and potential"" emphasizes its worth, justifying the high asking price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.

By starting high, Alice can potentially secure a price significantly above Bob's perceived value, while still leaving room to negotiate down to a figure that remains profitable for her."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and your initial offer.  There's room for negotiation. Selling to John right now would meet your minimum, but there's potential to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount and a serious offer on my end."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (But Not Too Much):**  Alice comes down from her initial offer but remains significantly above Bob's price, showing she's willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Highlight Value Again:**  The phrase ""true value of this product"" reinforces that the product is worth a premium.
* **""Meet You Halfway""**: This framing creates a sense of fairness, even though the reduction isn't precisely half.
* **""Serious Offer""**: This language signals that Alice is getting closer to her bottom line and encourages Bob to engage more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, ensuring you don't lose money.  

It's often better to take a sure profit than risk getting bogged down in a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
