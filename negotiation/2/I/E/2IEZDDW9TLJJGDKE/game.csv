"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000.  It's a high-value item with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm more comfortable in the $500,000 range.  What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is far below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, considering the value this product holds.  Let's try to find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget. I can offer you $650,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its potential while working for me financially.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have budget constraints, but $650,000 is simply not a feasible price for me. I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm offering $1,000,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest,  $1,000,000 is still a stretch for me.  My absolute limit is $700,000. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",700000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let me know your decision.",850000.0,Alice,7,
