Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $230. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 230} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start with a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchor Price:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" the price in Bob's mind. Even though it's much higher than his perceived value, it sets a reference point for further discussion.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price this high indicates you're willing to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to engage further.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($150) and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, his message suggests he's genuinely interested. This means there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your target.
* **John is a backup:**  You have the security of John's offer ($150).  You can leverage this to push for a better price from Bob.

Let's continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $230 was my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. However, $120 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $190?"", ""product_price"": 190}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and appreciate:**  Start by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing you value his interest. This maintains a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Explain your position:**  Briefly explain that while you're willing to negotiate, his offer is too low. 
* **Propose a compromise:**  Suggest a price that's a significant decrease from your initial offer but still comfortably above your minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while aiming for a profitable outcome. 
* **""Meeting in the middle"":**  Framing the counteroffer as meeting in the middle encourages Bob to reciprocate with a similarly reasonable counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $190 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking of making an offer of $160. It's still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** Bob's offer of $160 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer ensures a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, the potential gain is likely small. It might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Continuing negotiation prolongs the process. Accepting now allows you to complete the sale and move on.

Bob's latest offer represents a reasonable compromise and a profitable outcome for you."
