# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really benefit from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
