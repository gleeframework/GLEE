"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's significantly above your maximum budget and leaves no room for negotiation. You should make a counteroffer, aiming to bring the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is a significant difference from Alice's offer, it anchors the negotiation closer to your desired price range.  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer allows space for Alice to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Alternative Option:** Remember, you always have the option of buying from John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is better than her initial price, but it's still above your $10,000 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** You have a little more room to negotiate, as Alice has shown a willingness to move from her original price. 
* **John's Offer:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $10,000 is your safety net. You can use this to your advantage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate by moving closer to her price.
* **Middle Ground:** $9,500 represents a compromise and might be tempting for Alice to accept.
* **Below Budget, Above John:** This offer keeps you below your maximum budget while still offering Alice a better price than she could get from John."
