Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to accept.  This approach allows for a potential counteroffer, giving you the chance to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to take a small risk to try and get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm happy to come down a little, but $135 is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $132.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is reasonable and the negotiation has gone on for a while. Accepting his offer is the best option at this point."
