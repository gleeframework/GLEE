"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still worthwhile to see if Alice is willing to go lower.  We have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating that you're serious about negotiating.  $75 is still within your budget, but it leaves room for Alice to counter if she's willing to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $82 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if she'll come down further. There are still 7 rounds left, and I can always buy from John for $120 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $82 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to offer $78 for it. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step up from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but also that I still believe $78 is a fair price. It keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $82 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $80.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80.50 is closer to my target price, I'm still not quite there. I have 5 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal.  I'll continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you coming down to $80.50. I'm getting closer to where I want to be, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to offer $79 for it.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 79}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm serious about making a deal. $79 is still well within my budget and leaves room for a small compromise from Alice. We've been moving in the right direction, and this should encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob. I'm offering the product to you for $79.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a great deal for me!  While I would love to get it down to my target $78, Alice has come down significantly and is now only $1.50 away from my last offer. I'm confident that I won't be able to get a much lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with only 3 rounds left. It's also worth noting that John is selling the same product for $120, so this is a much better price."
