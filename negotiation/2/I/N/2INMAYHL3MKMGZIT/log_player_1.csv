Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $850,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value it brings to me and the opportunity cost of dealing with another vendor.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
