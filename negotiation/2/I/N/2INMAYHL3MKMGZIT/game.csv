"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $850,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value it brings to me and the opportunity cost of dealing with another vendor.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the initial offer and the counteroffer you presented. I look forward to your feedback and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",900000.0,Alice,3,
