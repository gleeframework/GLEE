Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its unique features and benefits. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** The message lightly justifies the high price by mentioning ""unique features and benefits,"" aiming to nudge Bob towards accepting.

**Important Note:** While John guarantees a minimum sale price, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a significantly better outcome."
