"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value to both of us. Given its worth to you, I propose to offer it to you for $950,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between the intrinsic value of the product and my objective to maximize its worth. I believe this offer presents an attractive proposition that respects both our interests. Please let me know if you would like to discuss further details or consider this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than your walk-away price of $1,200,000 and leaves a substantial amount of room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. This doesn't mean you'll walk away â€“ it just sets the stage for a potential counter-offer from Alice that could save you a considerable sum."
