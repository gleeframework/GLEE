"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $135.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'd accept ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message can help build rapport and make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message implies that I'm open to discussing the price, encouraging Bob to counteroffer if necessary. 

This strategy allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired value while still leaving room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than nothing, I am still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's closer to my desired price point.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I have a backup option of selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  $125 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about $130?  I'm willing to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I acknowledge Bob's interest and reiterate my willingness to find a solution.
* **Setting the stage for agreement:** The ""meet you halfway"" statement subtly positions $130 as the logical next step, making it more likely Bob will accept.

This approach aims to close the gap and potentially secure a deal before having to go through more rounds.  I'm also hoping to leverage the remaining rounds and the potential sale to John as leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $128. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $128 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter again.   There are still 6 rounds left, and I have a backup option of selling to John for $150. I'm hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $128 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $132? That's just a couple dollars more, and it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying close to my desired price:** I'm raising the price only slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Emphasizing the closeness of the deal:**  ""A couple dollars more"" and ""closer to a deal"" highlight that we are nearing an agreement.
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By suggesting we're close, it subtly pressures Bob to accept, especially given the potential sale to John for a higher price.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap further and potentially secure a deal in the next round. It balances my desire to earn more with the need to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $132. How about we meet at $129? It's just a small step from your previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $129 is only $3 away from my minimum acceptable price of $126.  Given the limited number of rounds remaining and the possibility of selling to John for $150, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to counter again, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further. Accepting his offer now secures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing a deal altogether.

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale at a price that's reasonably close to my minimum.  I also avoid the potential for a stalemate that could lead to me selling to John for a lower profit."
