Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aim high initially, leaving room for negotiation. This maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but comfortably above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable outcome. 

By setting a strong initial offer, you create a favorable starting point for negotiations while ensuring you don't undervalue the product."
