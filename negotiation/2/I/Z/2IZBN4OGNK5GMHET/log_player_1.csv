Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to scare him off immediately. Starting with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" and ""interest"" subtly implies the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** We don't want a flat ""take it or leave it"" approach. Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and keeps the conversation going. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes we don't know much about Bob's negotiating style. If we knew he was very price-sensitive, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If we were on a tight deadline, we might lower the initial price to ensure a quicker sale. However, with John as a backup buyer, we have some leverage."
