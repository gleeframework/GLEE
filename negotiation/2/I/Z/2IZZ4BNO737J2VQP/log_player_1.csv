"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's justified because the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a more reasonable offer than my initial $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to meet me halfway as he knows the product's true value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied.  There's potential to get closer to $1,000,000. I'll counteroffer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,050,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on my belief that the product is worth more than $1,000,000.  I hope this will persuade him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $975,000 is getting closer to my target price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I have several rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,025,000.  This is a small decrease from my previous offer, but it signals to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. We're only $25,000 apart now, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $990,000 is very close to my target price, I only have two rounds left and I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can push for that last $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is my final offer. I'm confident that Bob understands the value of the product and will accept. If he rejects, I'll sell the product to John for the same price.  This way, I guarantee I'll get my desired price and avoid further negotiation."
