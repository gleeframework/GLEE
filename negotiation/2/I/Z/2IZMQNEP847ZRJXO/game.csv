"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a significant step down from its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to pay right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
