Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
