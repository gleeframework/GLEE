"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only afford $85.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",85.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,6,
