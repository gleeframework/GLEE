"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to build rapport and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I need to get closer to my minimum, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is lower than I'd like to go, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price with further negotiation. It's worth continuing to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way we both get a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, his offers are consistently below my minimum. With only four rounds remaining, I don't have time to negotiate further.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is more secure than potentially ending up with less from Bob."
