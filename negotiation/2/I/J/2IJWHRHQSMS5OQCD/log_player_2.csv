# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. While I can't disclose the details publicly, I can assure you it's worth at least $10000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a significant discount considering its true potential.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $8,000, and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  He can get the same product from John for a much lower price."
