"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  My budget for this is $8,000.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 if you're open to negotiating.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product is truly valuable and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
