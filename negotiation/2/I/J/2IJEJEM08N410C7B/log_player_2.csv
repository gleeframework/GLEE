"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1000000. While I can't disclose specifics without a confidentiality agreement, I'm confident this could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1500000. This is a limited-time offer, so please consider it carefully. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she claims the product could be worth more, it's a gamble to pay more than your maximum. It's better to reject her offer and go with the guaranteed purchase from John for $1,000,000."
