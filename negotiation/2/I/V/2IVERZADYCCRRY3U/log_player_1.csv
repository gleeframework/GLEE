Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob at $100, which is a price that is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to potentially earn more than the $80 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than John's offer, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. How about $88?  That's a decent jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $88 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than what John is offering, and it's a good price considering the negotiation process.  I'll accept his offer."
