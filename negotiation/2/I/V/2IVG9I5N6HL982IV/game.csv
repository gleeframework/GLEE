"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, I'm not quite ready to go to $800,000 yet. I'm going to offer you $700,000.  This is still a good price for you, considering you're getting closer to your desired amount than you would from John. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
