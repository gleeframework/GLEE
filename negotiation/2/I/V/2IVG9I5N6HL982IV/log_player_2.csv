# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

It's a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get a better price."
