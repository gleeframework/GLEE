"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. For the product, I would like to propose a price of $95. This reflects my desire to maintain a fair profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer of $95 is still within your budget of $120, and it's closer to your desired price of $90. It's a good deal considering your other option is to buy from John for $120."
