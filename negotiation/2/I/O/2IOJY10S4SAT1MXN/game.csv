"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at $1500000, and I believe it would be a fantastic asset for your business.  To start our conversation, I'd like to propose a price of $1750000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for room for a fair negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $1600000 doesn't quite meet my needs. To demonstrate my commitment to a fair agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1650000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground!  What are your thoughts?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1625000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
