"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product at a price that I think is very competitive. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's not a good deal to buy from Alice at $12,000 when you can get it from John for $10,000.  Let's try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product and am willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would allow me to purchase the product while still being within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can offer you a price of $11,250, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's closer to the value of the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not within my budget.  I'd rather just go with John at this point, as the price is what I'm looking for."
