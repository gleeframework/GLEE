Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's down to the wire, and Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high.  While you might be able to get a slightly lower price in the final round, there's no guarantee. You're very close to the price John is offering, and there's no point in risking a potential failure to close the deal.  It's best to buy from John and avoid any further delays."
