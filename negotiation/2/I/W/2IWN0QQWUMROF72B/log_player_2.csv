"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying Alice's asking price. You can get the same product from John for a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that you are serious about buying the product but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your goal, John offers a better price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than your previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current price. This shows Alice you're serious about buying, but also signals you're not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than John's price. It's not worth continuing the negotiation for the sake of saving a small amount of money.  It's better to secure the product from John and avoid further potential delays or complications with Alice."
