Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the starting price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential, Alice, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,475,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand.

**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go above $1,500,000.  At this point, it's more profitable to cut the negotiation short and take John's guaranteed offer. 
 
It's important to remember the time value of money and opportunity cost. Continuing negotiations with Bob for a potentially small gain isn't worth risking the sure sale to John."
