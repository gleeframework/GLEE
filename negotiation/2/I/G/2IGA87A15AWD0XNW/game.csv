"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the starting price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a strong return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a competitive offer considering its potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
