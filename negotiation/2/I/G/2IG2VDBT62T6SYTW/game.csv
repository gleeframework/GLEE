"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but would be happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $120 is still above my budget. How about we settle on $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
