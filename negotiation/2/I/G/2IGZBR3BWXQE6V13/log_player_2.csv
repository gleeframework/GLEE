# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. This offer takes into account both the worth of the product to you and my desire to achieve a fair return. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

While Alice's offer of $120 is better than her initial asking price, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off going with the guaranteed lower price."
