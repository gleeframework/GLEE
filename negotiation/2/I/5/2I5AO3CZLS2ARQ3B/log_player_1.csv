Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're open to negotiation. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50.  This would give us both a good deal and let us move forward with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price,  $107.50 is a good deal, and it's getting late in the game. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
