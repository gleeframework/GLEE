"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,850,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer, reflecting the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm ready to close the deal soon, but I need the price to be right. How about we settle at $1,400,000?  That's a strong offer, and it would allow us to wrap things up quickly.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  Let's split the difference and call it a deal at $1,500,000.  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair solution for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
