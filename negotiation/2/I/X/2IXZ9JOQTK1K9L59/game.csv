"Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is of great interest to me, but I believe $900,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell it for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
