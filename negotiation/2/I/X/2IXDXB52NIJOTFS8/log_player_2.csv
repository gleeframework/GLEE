"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $17,000 is higher than my budget and what John offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $17,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($12,000) gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $15,000 maximum and John's offer. It's a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $15,500?  That gives us both a little wiggle room. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice moved closer to my range, $15,500 is still more than John's offer.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?"",
""product_price"": 13750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Splitting the difference between her current offer ($15,500) and my previous offer ($12,000) keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $13,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $14,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is now offering the product for $14,500, which is below John's price of $15,000. It's a reasonable compromise and meets my goal of getting the product for a good price. There's a chance I could push for a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are minimal and might risk losing the deal altogether."
