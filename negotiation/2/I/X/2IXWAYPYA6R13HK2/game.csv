"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $700,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
