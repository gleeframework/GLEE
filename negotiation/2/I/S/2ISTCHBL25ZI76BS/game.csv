"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1300000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1250000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1200000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1200000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1220000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you. What do you think?",1220000.0,Alice,5,
