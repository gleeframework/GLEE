"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You don't know her minimum selling price, so there's a possibility of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong negotiating position and forces Alice to either accept a lower price or counter with something more reasonable.  Since we have 10 rounds, we have room to adjust if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to continue negotiating in hopes of getting an even better price. I have several rounds left, so there's still time to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price below her current offer. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, while also putting pressure on her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's price has gone up! This indicates she's either very confident in the value of the product or she's playing hardball.  Since my goal is to save money and my maximum budget is $800,000, I'm better off buying from John at this point.  Continuing negotiations with Alice risks me paying more than my budget."
