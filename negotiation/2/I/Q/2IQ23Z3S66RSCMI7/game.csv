"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and our initial discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allows us to both find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this revised offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our discussions so far.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
