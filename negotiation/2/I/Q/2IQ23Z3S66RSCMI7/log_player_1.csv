Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal, as you know the value is significant.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me more room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Offering Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that it's a good deal even at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, inviting Bob to express his thoughts. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's not enough for me to accept at this point.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to reach a compromise closer to $1,250,000. 
* If Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely move on to John, as the risk of continued negotiation with Bob is too high at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and our initial discussions, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would still be a great deal for you and allows us to both find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with this revised offer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, implying that even at this price, it's a good deal for him. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that it allows both of us to achieve our goals.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, allowing Bob to respond to my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price and closed the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to weigh the potential of further negotiation against the certainty of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our discussions so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** While he's moving closer, it's not enough for me to accept at this point.
* **The risk of continued negotiation with Bob is too high.** He seems unwilling to budge much, and I'm not confident we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option.**  It guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will move on to John and sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
