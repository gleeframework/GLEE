"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in this product's value, and I do too. But $1,650,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. It's a fair compromise that recognizes the potential of this product while staying within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. Selling to John guarantees the maximum value of the product ($1,500,000) without further negotiation and potential for a lower final price."
