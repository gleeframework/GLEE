{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?

$1,650,000 is still too high. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not going to give in to her full asking price. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
