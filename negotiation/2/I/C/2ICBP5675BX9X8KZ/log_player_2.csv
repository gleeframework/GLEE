* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, giving you ample opportunity to try and lower the price. 
* **John is a fallback option:**  While buying from John is the worst-case scenario, knowing it's available gives you negotiating leverage."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your seriousness about negotiating.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter at a price that's reasonable for both parties.
* **Avoiding John:**  The goal is to save money, and buying from John should be a last resort."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Closing the gap:** It further reduces the price gap and makes a deal more likely.
* **Still under budget:** You're still well within your budget and can afford to pay $10,000."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is very close to your ideal price point, making it a good deal.
* **Risk of going higher:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to a higher price in subsequent rounds, especially if Alice becomes more resistant.
* **Time is running out:** You've already used 4 rounds and need to be mindful of the remaining rounds.  

While it's tempting to keep negotiating, accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal within your budget and avoids risking a worse outcome."
