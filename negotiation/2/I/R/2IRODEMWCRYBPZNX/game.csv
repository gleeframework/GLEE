"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
