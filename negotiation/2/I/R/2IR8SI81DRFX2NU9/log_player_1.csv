Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum price of $100, giving you a profit, but it's also lower than Bob's maximum value of $120, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is still better than selling to John, and it is closer to the price I initially wanted. It's a win for me."
