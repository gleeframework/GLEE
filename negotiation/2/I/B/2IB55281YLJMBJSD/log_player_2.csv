"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but  $115 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my price, and $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept and save some money than risk her retracting the offer and having to settle for John's price."
