Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but it's also high enough to show I value the product and that I'm not desperate to sell it. I can always lower my price later if Bob makes a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and closer to my initial asking price.  It's also more than I'd get from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
