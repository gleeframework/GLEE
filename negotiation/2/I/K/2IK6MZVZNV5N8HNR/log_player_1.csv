"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for your product.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll try to counter-offer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,800.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $8800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8600. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $8,600 is slightly lower than my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited rounds.  I'd rather secure a sale than risk losing out entirely."
