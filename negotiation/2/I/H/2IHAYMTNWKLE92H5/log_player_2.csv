"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-return investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range. You're looking to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense.  You have room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential gains for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,150,000 is still above your desired price range.  You can likely negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering again makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the compromise, but I'm still a little above my budget at $1,150,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be beneficial, and I'm eager to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're still aiming for a price below $1,100,000. While Alice has shown flexibility, $1,125,000 is still a bit high.  There's still room for negotiation, and you have a few rounds left to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this offer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,120,000, which is very close to your counteroffer of $1,100,000. Given that you have limited rounds left and the price is fairly close to your desired range, accepting the offer is the best option.  You've saved a significant amount compared to John's offer, and you've secured the product."
