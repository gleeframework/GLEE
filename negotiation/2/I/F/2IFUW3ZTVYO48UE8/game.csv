"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $125 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50. Can we make a deal at that price?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $128.75? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal.",128.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $126, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to buy the product from you.",126.0,Bob,6,
