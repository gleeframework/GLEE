"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's room to negotiate downwards if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to close a deal, $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my desired range.
* **Testing Bob's limits:** By rejecting his offer, I'm seeing how committed he is to purchasing the product and how much he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $125 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price slightly. 
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" for both of us, hoping to emphasize the win-win aspect.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm still being friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $127.50. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $127.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for better deal:** I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for a higher amount.
* **Testing Bob's commitment:** By rejecting Bob's offer again, I'm gauging how serious he is about buying the product and if he's willing to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $127.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $128.75? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 128.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but offering compromise:** I'm maintaining my stance that $127.50 is too low but offering a compromise by splitting the difference with Bob's last offer.
* **Appealing to fairness again:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" aspect, highlighting the mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Moving closer to the middle:** This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $128.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $126, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $126 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer and counter, there's a high chance he won't budge further. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** I can guarantee myself a profit of $150 by selling to John, which is more than what Bob is offering.

**Conclusion:** Given the limited negotiation room and the risk of further haggling, selling to John is the most sensible choice to maximize my profit."
