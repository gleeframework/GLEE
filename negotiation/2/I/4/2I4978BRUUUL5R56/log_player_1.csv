"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to make Bob feel good about the potential deal and encourage him to engage.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** This initial offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer, which is likely to happen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  Here's why:

* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. He's clearly interested in the product.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting the offer puts me in a stronger negotiating position. It shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a better deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore further options before potentially settling with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm meeting Bob halfway,  showing flexibility but not giving away too much.
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by referencing the value of the product, making it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, inviting Bob to consider my offer and potentially come up with a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Goal:** $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Time Pressure:** With limited rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.
* **Potential Loss:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob completely and being forced to sell to John at a lower price.

While I'd love to get closer to my initial target, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic move at this point."
