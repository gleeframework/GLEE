"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get at least my minimum price of $10000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is $8000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer at $11000. This is a compromise, but it's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $9000, so I'll counteroffer at $10000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $10000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet your budget, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counteroffer at $11500. This is a bit above your offer, but it's still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $10000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. I'd like to reiterate that I can buy the product from John for $8000 if we can't come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,6,
