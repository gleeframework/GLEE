"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and a great deal for you given the value you've described. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $850,000 is quite a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,000,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you considering the potential returns.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm ready to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $975,000? This feels like a fair point to land, offering a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
