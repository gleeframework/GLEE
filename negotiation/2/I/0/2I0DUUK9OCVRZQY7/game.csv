"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,750?  I think this would be a fair price for both of us. ",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
