"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low. How about $11,000? This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a higher price.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position and that you have other potential buyers.  However, I have a firm budget for this purchase.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000. It's a fair offer considering it's my final offer, take it or leave it.",10000.0,Bob,6,
