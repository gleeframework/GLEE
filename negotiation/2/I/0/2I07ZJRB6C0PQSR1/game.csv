"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500. This product is worth $10000 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still hoping to find a middle ground. How about $8750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at that price.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $8750 is still a bit too far from my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $8900 as a final compromise. If we can reach an agreement at that price, we can close the deal.  If not, I'm afraid we'll need to move on.",8900.0,Alice,5,
