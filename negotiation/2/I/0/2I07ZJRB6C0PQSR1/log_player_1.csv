Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500. This product is worth $10000 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,000?  It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. I'm still hoping to find a middle ground. How about $8750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try to push for a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $8,750 is still a bit too far from my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900 as a final compromise. If we can reach an agreement at that price, we can close the deal.  If not, I'm afraid we'll need to move on."", ""product_price"": 8900}
