I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good compromise:

* **It's better than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000** 
* **It's still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $12,000**. 

This gives Bob a chance to buy the product at a lower price, while still guaranteeing me a profit if he rejects the offer."
