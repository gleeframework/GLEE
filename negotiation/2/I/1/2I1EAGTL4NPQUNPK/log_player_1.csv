"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for your business. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price to see how much room for negotiation there is.  It's a risky move, but the goal is to maximize my profit and see if I can get close to my target of $1,000,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  This product is valuable, but I'm looking at something closer to $600,000.  What's the best you can do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my target, but it's also lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer for now and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  Selling to John right now would be profitable, but I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob and I can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $600,000.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and reflects the value I place on doing business with you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

I've decided to make a counteroffer to Bob at $900,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a significant step closer to Bob's offer. I believe this shows I'm willing to negotiate, and it may be tempting enough for Bob to accept. If he doesn't, we'll have more rounds to explore options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but I need you to move a bit more for us to make a deal.  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject this offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round.  While selling to John would be safe and profitable, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to see it through for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the importance I place on closing a deal with you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I've decided to come down to $800,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's a significant compromise on my part. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal. If he rejects this offer, I'm still considering selling to John, but I'm giving Bob one last chance to make a deal."
