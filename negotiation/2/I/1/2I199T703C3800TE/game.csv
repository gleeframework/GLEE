"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $650,000 is tempting, it's a bit too far off what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000.  That gives you a good price point, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However,  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and it's within your budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
