"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $650,000 is tempting, it's a bit too far off what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000.  That gives you a good price point, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However,  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let me know your thoughts."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and it's within your budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer matches John's price. There's no benefit to further negotiation or buying from John.  Accepting now secures the deal at your target price."
