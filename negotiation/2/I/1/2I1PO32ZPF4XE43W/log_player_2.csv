"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly higher than your target price of $800,000. 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the initial offer gives you more room to try and get a better price. 
* Buying from John immediately is also an option, but negotiating with Alice might give you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still above your target price of $800,000. 
*  It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product, but you're not willing to pay her full asking price.
* This gives Alice room to counteroffer, but it also puts pressure on her to come down from her original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $950,000 is closer to your target price, it's still above your maximum of $800,000. 
* You have several rounds remaining, so continuing to negotiate could get you a better price. 
* Buying from John is always a safe option, but you still have a chance to get a deal closer to your desired price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's last offer. 
* It shows Alice you are willing to move towards her price, but still maintain some leverage. 
* This should put some pressure on Alice to come down from her price, as she has already rejected a lower offer from you."
