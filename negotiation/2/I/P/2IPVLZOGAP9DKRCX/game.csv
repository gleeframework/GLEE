"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price, considering your initial offer was $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiations, so please let me know your thoughts on this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand you see the value in this product, as do I.  While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, I'm holding out for a figure closer to my initial offer. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Considering your initial offer was $1,400,000 and you're now offering $1,350,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
