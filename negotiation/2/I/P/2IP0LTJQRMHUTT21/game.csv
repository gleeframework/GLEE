"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a good return on my investment.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need to make sure I get a fair price for this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This offer still provides you with a good deal, and it allows me to get a reasonable return.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
