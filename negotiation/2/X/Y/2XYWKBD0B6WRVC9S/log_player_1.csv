Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a $10 discount, making it more enticing for him to buy, while still giving you a $40 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a backup option with John."
