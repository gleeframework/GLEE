Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $125, and it's better to secure the product at the known $120 price from John."
