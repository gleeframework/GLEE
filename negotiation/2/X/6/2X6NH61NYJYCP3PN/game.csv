"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $775,000 yet. I'll offer you a revised price of $825,000. This is still a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
