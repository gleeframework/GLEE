,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,000?  It's a fair compromise and a great price for such a valuable product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",12500.0,Bob,4,
