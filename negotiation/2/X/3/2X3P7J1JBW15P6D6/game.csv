"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be incredibly valuable to your operations. Given its potential for your business, I'm asking for $1200000. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from this acquisition. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1500000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value and the significant benefit it will bring to your company.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still offers a substantial margin for you, while allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price closer to $950000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1500000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975000. This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round to finalize the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $975000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $960000, but I need to see a price that's closer to that. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. I'm willing to drop to $965000, which is closer to your offer.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that will allow us both to secure a beneficial deal.  Let's close this transaction and move forward.",965000.0,Alice,7,
