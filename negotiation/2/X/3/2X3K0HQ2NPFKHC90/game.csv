"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,200.  This would allow me to make the purchase and it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,200 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but only if you're willing to throw in some additional services that will enhance the product's functionality. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not interested in any additional services at this time. I'm confident I can maximize the product's functionality on my own. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $10,300 for the product as is.  This is my final offer.",10300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,300, but I'm still not convinced that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know that you're serious about this deal. I'll offer you the product for $10,400, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer.",10400.0,Alice,7,
