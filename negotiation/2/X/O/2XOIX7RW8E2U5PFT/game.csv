"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $80 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good price, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can make this work!",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on a product you've said you want. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,5,
