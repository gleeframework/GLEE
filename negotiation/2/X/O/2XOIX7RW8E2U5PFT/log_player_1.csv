"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more than $80 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $65 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to get closer to that value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a good price, but $65 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to get closer to that value in the next round, but I'm starting to think about selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go lower than $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good deal on a product you've said you want. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
