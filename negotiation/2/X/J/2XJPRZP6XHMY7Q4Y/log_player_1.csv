"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is too low for me. I need to at least get close to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to my value for this product. How about $1,250,000? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the $1,100,000 range. Would you be open to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000.  How about $1,150,000? It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
