I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from Bob.  It seems like we're stuck in a price range that's not ideal for either of us.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not the best I hoped for, but it's a decent outcome given the negotiation with Bob."
