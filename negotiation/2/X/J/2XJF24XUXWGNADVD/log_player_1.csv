Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for me, and I'm confident you'll still make a significant profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
