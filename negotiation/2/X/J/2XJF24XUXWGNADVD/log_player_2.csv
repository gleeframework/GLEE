"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this product from you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a competitive offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for me, and I'm confident you'll still make a significant profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's preferred price, but it's getting closer to his budget.  At this point, it's probably worth accepting the offer and avoiding further negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Potential for further negotiation is uncertain:**  There's no guarantee that Bob can negotiate a lower price, and Alice might become less willing to compromise.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, potentially costing Bob time and opportunity.
* **The price is reasonable:** While $1,100,000 is not ideal, it's still within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for both parties.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
