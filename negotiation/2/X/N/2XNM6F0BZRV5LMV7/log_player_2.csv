"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate down towards our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too rich for me. I'm thinking closer to $60.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a lowball offer, significantly below our true maximum. This leaves room to negotiate upward while aiming for a price well below Alice's asking price.  The message aims to be polite but firm, indicating our budget constraints without being offensive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. This product is really high-quality and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $130 is still too high for us. We need to show Alice we're willing to negotiate further but won't accept a price that far exceeds our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could you do $75? That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We've made a significant jump from our initial lowball offer, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate. However, we're still staying well within our $80 limit. Framing the offer as ""fair"" and mentioning our ""strict budget"" reinforces our position without being confrontational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  This product is worth a lot to me. Would you be willing to consider $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a crucial point in the negotiation. Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" creating a sense of urgency.  However, $100 still exceeds our budget. By rejecting, we're calling her bluff (is it truly her final offer?) and signaling we're serious about our price limit. We're willing to risk losing the deal to get a price closer to what we want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I can go up to $80, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a good deal for that price."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is our final move. We've reached our absolute maximum price. By being firm but still polite, we're communicating that we're serious and won't budge further. We've also highlighted that this is a good deal for her at this price, appealing to her desire to make a sale. If she rejects this, we'll go with John's offer in the next round."
