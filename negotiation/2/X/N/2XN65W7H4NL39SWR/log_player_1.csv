Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can start high.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic positioning:** The offered price of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still offers a potential ""discount"" compared to your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Gauging interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John. If he counters, it indicates a willingness to negotiate, and you can adjust accordingly."
