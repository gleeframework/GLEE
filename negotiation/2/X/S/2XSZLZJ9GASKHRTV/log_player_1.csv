Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, a price of $100 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** This price point aims to maximize your profit while still ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. It's significantly more than your backup offer from John ($80)."
