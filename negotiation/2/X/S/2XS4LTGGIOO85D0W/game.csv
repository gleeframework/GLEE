"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to get a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. Would you consider $850000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
