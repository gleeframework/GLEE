"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your maximum budget of $120. It's not even worth considering. You have more leverage to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to my maximum budget. This will put pressure on Alice to negotiate, but it's still a price I'm willing to pay if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my maximum budget, it's still a bit high. I have more rounds to negotiate and I want to try to get the price down further.  I'm willing to risk rejecting the offer and see if I can get Alice to come down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's last offer of $140 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping to get it lower. My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise - it's a significant increase from my previous offer, but still lower than Alice's price. I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about buying the product, while still pushing for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is within my budget and I'm running out of rounds.  While I could potentially get a lower price, the risk of getting nothing is high. I'm willing to accept this offer and move on."
