,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential you see in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's aim for a more agreeable price point. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a win-win situation for both of us, as it's a fair price that allows us to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
