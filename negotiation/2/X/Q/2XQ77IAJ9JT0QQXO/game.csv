"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to consider that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $150. Would you be willing to consider $135? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $135 is still too low for me. How about $145? This is a really good deal for you, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $140? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,6,
