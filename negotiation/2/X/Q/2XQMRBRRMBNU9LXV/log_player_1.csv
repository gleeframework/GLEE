Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
