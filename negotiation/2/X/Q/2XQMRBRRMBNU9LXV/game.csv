"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of the product and offers you a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $900,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your budget limitations. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a final offer of $1,250,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
