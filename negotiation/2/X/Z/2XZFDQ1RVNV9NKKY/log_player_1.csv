Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,015,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,015,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer a final price of $1,035,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally like to get closer to my target price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $1,020,000 is a decent price, and better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
