Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you'll see on your investment.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **High but Reasonable:** Starting with a high price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob and justify the high price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You make a $950,000 profit, which is fantastic.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make more than selling to John.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000.

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while securing a strong backup plan."
