"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about getting a better price. He's aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal range while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob still has room to negotiate. While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely get a price closer to his target of $10,000.  He'll reject and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,500?  I'm hoping we can close the deal on this number."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved closer to Alice's offer, but still has some room to negotiate.  This counteroffer shows his willingness to compromise while also keeping his goal of saving as much money as possible in mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal price. While $11,250 is still higher than his ideal, it's within his budget and represents a good deal compared to buying from John.  He should accept the offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential price increases."
