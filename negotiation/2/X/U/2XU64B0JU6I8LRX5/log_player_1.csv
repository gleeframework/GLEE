"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth more to Bob, so there's a good chance he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round.  While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $130.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a little low for me.  How about $120?  I think that's fair considering the value this product brings. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 
 
I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  $120 is a good middle ground, and I think Bob will find it appealing."
