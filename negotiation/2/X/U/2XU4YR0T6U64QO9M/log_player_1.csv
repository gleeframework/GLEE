Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Bob, thank you for considering my product. I understand your valuation and would like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is still above your perceived value, but I hope we can come to an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting ensures a sale and secures a good profit."
