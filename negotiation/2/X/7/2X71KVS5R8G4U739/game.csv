"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $90?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can reach a fair deal.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $105? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us and lets us finalize this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
