Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I've done some further research and I believe the product's value is not quite as high as you've stated. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. Can you meet me at this price?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. Can you meet me at this price?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit away from the price I'm willing to pay. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though Bob claims it's his final offer, I'm going to reject it.  I'm still within my desired range and confident I can push for a better price. The risk of selling to John for $800,000 is still too high at this point. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
