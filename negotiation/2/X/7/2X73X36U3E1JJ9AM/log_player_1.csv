Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm not opposed to negotiating, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering Bob a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above his current offer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that is too far below my minimum."
