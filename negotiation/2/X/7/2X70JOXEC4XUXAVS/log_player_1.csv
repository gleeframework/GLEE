{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good deal while still being fair for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a good midpoint between my minimum and Bob's perceived value.  It also leaves room for potential counteroffers, but importantly, it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than $8,000 from John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
