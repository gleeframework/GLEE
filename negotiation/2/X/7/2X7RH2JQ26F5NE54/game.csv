"Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can we meet in the middle again?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised by offering $10500, and I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $10000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $9800. I think that's a fair price for the product.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9800. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $9900. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering the value it will bring to me.",9900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9900. I'm willing to make one final offer at $10500, which is the minimum I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $10500. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9800. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000.",9800.0,Bob,10,
