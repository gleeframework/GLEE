Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm confident in the value of my product and I want to maximize my profit. I'll be prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response, but I won't go below my minimum of $15,000.  I'll also be ready to move on to John if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer Bob, and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I believe the product holds. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise.  It's only $1,000 less than my counteroffer and  significantly higher than what John is offering.  It's time to accept the deal and move on."
