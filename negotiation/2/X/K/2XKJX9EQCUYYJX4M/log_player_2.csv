Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,200,000? This would still allow you to make a profit, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
