"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm proposing a price halfway between Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.  This shows willingness to compromise while still ensuring I receive a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I want to see if I can push him higher, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while keeping the value of the product in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally above my minimum acceptable price, and with only four rounds left, it's getting risky to keep pushing for more.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and gets me closer to my desired price."
