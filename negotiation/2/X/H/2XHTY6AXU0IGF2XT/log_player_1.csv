"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially pricing it at $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This anchors the negotiation high and leaves room for strategic concessions.
* **Confident Positioning:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Openness to Discussion:** We signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.

This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will indicate how eager he is to acquire the product and how much he's willing to pay.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation that could lead to a price closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, considering my budget and needs, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $800,000. This suggests he's quite interested and there's room for us to negotiate a higher price, closer to our minimum of $1,000,000. 

While selling to John guarantees our minimum, we stand to gain more by strategically engaging with Bob for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows you're serious about this product. To be frank, $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This reflects the true value of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** We want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, recognizing his effort while standing firm on our price.
* **Justification:**  Instead of simply dismissing his offer, we're re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Strategic Concession:** We've come down from our initial price but remain significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing, though not literally the midpoint, encourages Bob to view our counteroffer as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered the value of the product and am willing to offer $1,050,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 surpasses our minimum threshold of $1,000,000. While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
