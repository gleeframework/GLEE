Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a fair price considering my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk Bob walking away or ending up with a price significantly lower than John's offer."
