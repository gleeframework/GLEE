"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible outcome. There are still 9 rounds left, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is a more strategic approach."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,250 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. Rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer could lead to a better deal before he has to resort to buying from John for a higher price.  There are still several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price that's more in line with my expectations."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the terms. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250, but I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services, which would normally cost $250. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra benefits to help you get the most out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While the additional support and maintenance services are appealing, the total cost of $11,250 is still higher than Bob's desired price point. He's already made a counteroffer at $11,000, so rejecting this offer and counteroffering again could lead to a better deal or force Alice to accept the previous offer. It's not worth paying $250 extra for services when he can still negotiate a lower price. There are also several rounds remaining to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer of additional support, but I'm still focused on getting the best price for the product itself. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  Let's see if we can agree on that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll throw in an additional 6 months of warranty, which is normally a $1,000 value. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra peace of mind. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is firm on her $11,500 price.  While the extended warranty is nice, it doesn't make up for the extra $500 Bob would pay compared to his last counteroffer. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiations not yielding a better price is too high.  John's offer of $15,000 provides a safety net and ensures Bob can acquire the product within his budget."
