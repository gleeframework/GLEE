"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000. This is a fair price that's more in line with my expectations.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to the terms. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250, but I'll throw in some additional support and maintenance services, which would normally cost $250. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra benefits to help you get the most out of it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer of additional support, but I'm still focused on getting the best price for the product itself. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  Let's see if we can agree on that price.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $11,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll throw in an additional 6 months of warranty, which is normally a $1,000 value. This way, you'll get a great deal on the product and some extra peace of mind. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,7,
