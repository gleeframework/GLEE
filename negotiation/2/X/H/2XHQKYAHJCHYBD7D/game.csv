"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product does sound interesting, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range.  While $925,000 is better, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and land at $837,500?",837500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $837,500. I'm going to make a slightly higher counteroffer of $900,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, I am trying to get a good deal!  I understand this is your final compromise, but I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to settle at $862,500.  Let me know what you think.",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. However, I'll give you one last chance to meet me in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $885,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",885000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I assure you I'm serious, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. How about $873,750?  This is my final offer.",873750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to lose patience. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. However, I'll give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to what I'm willing to accept. I'll sell the product to you for $882,500. If you don't accept, I'm done negotiating with you.",882500.0,Alice,9,
