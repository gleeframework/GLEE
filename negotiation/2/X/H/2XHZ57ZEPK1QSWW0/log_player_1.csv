"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is reasonable given his valuation, I have a buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing John if I continue negotiating. It's in my best interest to sell to John for a guaranteed $80."
