"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $95. I think it's a fair price, considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room for negotiation. 
* **Building Rapport:**  The message is friendly and attempts to establish a sense of fairness.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not going straight for the $100 minimum, as this might make Bob feel pressured and unwilling to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $85?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $85 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
