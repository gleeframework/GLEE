"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my top price, considering its value to me. I hope you'll consider it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
