"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a good starting point for negotiation. While $1,200,000 isn't a terrible price, there's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale."

 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but I'm working with a tight budget. Would you consider $850,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it's still within a reasonable range considering my $1,000,000 maximum.  It leaves room for further negotiation while potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite and Positive:** The tone remains courteous and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive negotiating environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still within range of John's price. Let's push a little further and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about we settle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
 ""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Alice's latest offer and my previous one. It shows a willingness to move closer to her price but still holds firm on achieving a significant discount.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting this is a ""fair compromise,"" it subtly hints that this might be my final offer before considering John's guaranteed price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $975,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At $975,000, we're getting very close to John's price.  Continuing to negotiate might save a small amount, but there's a risk Alice will dig in, and we'll end up paying John's price anyway. Accepting this offer secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
