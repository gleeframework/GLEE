"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a significant investment for me.  How about we settle at $925,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $925,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $975,000.",975000.0,Alice,5,
