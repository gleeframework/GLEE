"Alice, your offer is very close but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings and allows me to make this investment work for my business. Let's see if we can close this deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to make this happen.",700000.0,Bob,6,
