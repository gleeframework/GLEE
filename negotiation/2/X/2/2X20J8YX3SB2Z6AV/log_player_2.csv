"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point. I want to try and negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is very close but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings and allows me to make this investment work for my business. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target price, it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can get her down further. I'm going to reject her offer and counter with a price closer to my target.  I have 7 rounds left, so there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $710,000 for the product, which is a solid price for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 710000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $720,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, it's still not quite where I want it to be.  I'm going to reject her offer and try one more time to get her down to my target price of $700,000.  I have 5 rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $700,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $715,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $715,000 is only $15,000 above my target price.  Given that we're approaching the end of our negotiations, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether.  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Alice will stick to her price or come down even less, potentially forcing me to buy from John at a higher price."
