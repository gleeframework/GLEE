Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $600,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,000,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to secure the product at a price that's valuable to you, and me to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy we're making progress. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise that values both our needs and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, she's still significantly above your walk-away price of $800,000.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best available price."
