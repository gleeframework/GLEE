"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll see the benefit in this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a profit closer to my desired $1,500,000. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for Bob, highlighting the value he'll receive. This builds a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting with a high offer to see if I can quickly secure a good deal. 
* I'm also leaving room for counteroffers to ensure the negotiation remains open. 
* I'm mindful of the 10-round limit and the backup offer from John, which will guide my decisions throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.  

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer** keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try and reach a more favorable agreement with Bob. 
* **Moving to the next round** gives me the opportunity to send a counteroffer that bridges the gap between our expectations. 
* While I have a backup option with John, I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first to potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $600,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,000,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to secure the product at a price that's valuable to you, and me to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still a far cry from Bob's offer, and importantly,  it's above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the compromise and the benefits for both of us. This helps maintain a positive tone and fosters a sense of collaboration.

**Strategy:**

* I'm starting to move closer to Bob's position but with a price that still reflects the value of the product. 
* The message aims to re-establish the potential value for Bob and make the offer seem attractive from his perspective. 
* I'm still committed to earning at least my minimum of $1,500,000 but am willing to negotiate further, keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting the offer** keeps the negotiation open, allowing me to continue exploring potential for a better deal. 
* **Moving to the next round** allows me to counteroffer with a price that is closer to my desired outcome.
* Selling to John is still a viable option, but I'm committed to seeing if I can reach a better agreement with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy we're making progress. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise that values both our needs and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $900,000. This represents a further compromise from my previous offer but still remains above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging the progress and emphasizing the compromise while highlighting the value for both parties. This encourages a collaborative and positive tone.

**Strategy:**

* I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's position, but maintaining a price that still reflects the product's value and ensures I don't lose money.
* The message aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept this offer.
* I'm still keeping my option to sell to John as a backup, but I'm hoping to close this deal with Bob before running out of rounds."
