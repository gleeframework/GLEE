"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $600,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,000,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to secure the product at a price that's valuable to you, and me to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy we're making progress. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a fair compromise that values both our needs and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
