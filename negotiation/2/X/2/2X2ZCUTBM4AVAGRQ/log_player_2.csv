Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's looking to spend no more than $12,000, and Alice's offer is above that. There's no reason to accept it right now."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, he's still willing to pay no more than $12,000. He has a guaranteed option to buy from John for that price, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet."
