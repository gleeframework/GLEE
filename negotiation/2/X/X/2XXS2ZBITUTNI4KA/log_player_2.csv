# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that being said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price. There's still room for compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm flattered that you're willing to invest so heavily in this product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $975,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000.  Even though he may be able to negotiate a slightly lower price with Alice, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiations and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase the product at a lower price from John."
