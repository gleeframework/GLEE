Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $85, which is $81.50. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to a price you find acceptable, it's unlikely she'll go below $80. You have a guaranteed option with John at $80, making it more sensible to cut your losses and buy from him."
