,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
