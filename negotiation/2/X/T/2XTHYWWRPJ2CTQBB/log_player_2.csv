**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000.
* **Potential for savings:** Even though you don't know the exact value of the product, it's worth at least $800,000 to Alice. This means you could potentially be getting a good deal, as she's selling it for less than what it's worth to her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a risk that the product might not be as valuable as you expect, the potential savings of $500,000 outweighs the risk. 

By accepting Alice's offer, you save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
