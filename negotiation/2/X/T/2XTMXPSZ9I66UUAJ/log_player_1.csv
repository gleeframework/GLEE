Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant amount in the right hands.  I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, getting Bob to buy it at a slightly lower price can still yield a very high profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves a substantial margin ($950,000) for Bob, incentivizing him to consider it seriously.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly influencing Bob's perception without explicitly revealing its worth to John. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob and maximizing potential profit."
