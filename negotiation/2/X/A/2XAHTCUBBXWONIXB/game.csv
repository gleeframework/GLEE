,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's split the difference and go with $109. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
