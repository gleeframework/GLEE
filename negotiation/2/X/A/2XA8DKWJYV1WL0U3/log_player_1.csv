Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $150 goal.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects the $140 offer, you should immediately sell to John at $150. There's no need to negotiate further with Bob as you already have a buyer at your desired minimum price."
