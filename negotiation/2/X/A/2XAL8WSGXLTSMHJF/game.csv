"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a profit and gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this negotiation and make this happen.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,6,
