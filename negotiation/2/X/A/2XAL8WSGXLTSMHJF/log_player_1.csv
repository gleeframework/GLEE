"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Framing the offer:** The message highlights the potential benefit for Bob, emphasizing the value he would gain by buying the product. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  This offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, increasing the chances of reaching an agreeable price.

**Important Note:** This is just my first offer. I'm keeping in mind the potential deal with John for $15,000, so I'll need to assess Bob's responses and make strategic decisions in the following rounds to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is offering a price above his perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Avoiding the risk of settling for less:** Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on the potential for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**  I will counter Bob's offer in the next round. I need to strike a balance between a price that is appealing to Bob and one that allows me to maximize my profits."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a profit and gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring a profit for me.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal by paying more than his perceived value. 

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary. I'm also still considering the alternative of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can reach a price closer to my target.
* **Risk assessment:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a higher price from Bob through further negotiations.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while ensuring I secure a profitable outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this negotiation and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Slight compromise:** I'm lowering my price again, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message highlights that this offer is a compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm adding urgency by suggesting that we close the deal and move forward.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a price point that is close to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept. If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John as a last resort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Limited negotiating room:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:** We are already in round 6, and I have only 4 rounds left to close a deal.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is more than what I can currently get from Bob.

**Decision:** I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I would have preferred to sell to Bob for a higher price, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds is too high. This decision ensures that I maximize my profit and avoid losing money."
