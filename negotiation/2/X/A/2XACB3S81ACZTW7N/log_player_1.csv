Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have an advantage knowing Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, so there's no pressure to go below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you suspect Bob is a strong negotiator, you might start even higher. 
* **Relationship Building:**  Consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is more valuable than maximizing profit on this single sale."
