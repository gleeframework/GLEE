Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price. It's worth exploring his willingness to pay more before accepting."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit low for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum target price of $8,000, but it's getting closer.  I want to see if we can meet in the middle before resorting to selling to John. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,875. This would allow me to meet my minimum and ensure you get a great deal on a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 8875}
