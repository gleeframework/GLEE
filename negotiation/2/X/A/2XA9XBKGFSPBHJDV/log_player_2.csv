"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth significantly more to you than its cost to me. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from it while ensuring a fair profit for me. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, he can likely do better. He has a buffer of $3,000 before needing to resort to John's offer, so he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your position, I need to maintain a certain margin for the product. I'm unable to accept $10,000. How about considering $11,000 as a compromise? This would still provide a reasonable profit for me while being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down from $12,000 to $11,000.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will walk away or make counteroffers that are too high.  Accepting $11,000 saves him $4,000 compared to buying from John, which is a significant savings."
