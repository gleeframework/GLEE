"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I understand your position, I need to maintain a certain margin for the product. I'm unable to accept $10,000. How about considering $11,000 as a compromise? This would still provide a reasonable profit for me while being competitive in the market.",11000.0,Alice,3,
