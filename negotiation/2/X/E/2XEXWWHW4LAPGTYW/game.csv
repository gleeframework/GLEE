"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13000.  This price still gives you a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,4,
