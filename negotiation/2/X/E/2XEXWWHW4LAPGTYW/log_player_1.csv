Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I can potentially get a better price by continuing negotiations or selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000.  This price still gives you a great deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $12500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of time. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
