"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $14,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a fair price.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there with $13,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,500?  It's a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $13,000 just isn't feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $13,250? It's only a small step from your last offer, but it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,7,
