"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $95 is closer but still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet at $100? That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
