Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $80 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet at $100? That's a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

It's unlikely Alice will go below $95, and you have a guaranteed option at $80 with John. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
