"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your needs. Given its high quality and functionality, I would like to propose a price of $200 for it. This reflects its true value and includes a special introductory discount. What do you think about this offer?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the introductory discount, $200 is outside my budget. Given my maximum value for this product is $100, I'm willing to offer you $80 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to counteroffer at $95 for the product. This price still reflects its value while being more accessible to your budget. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $95 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to offer $90 for the product. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value I'm getting.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $92 for the product. This price is slightly higher than your last proposal but still reflects the value of the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",92.0,Alice,5,
