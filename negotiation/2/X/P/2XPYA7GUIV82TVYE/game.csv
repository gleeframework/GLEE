"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.  Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider coming down to $12,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $12,000 is still a bit steep for me though. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
