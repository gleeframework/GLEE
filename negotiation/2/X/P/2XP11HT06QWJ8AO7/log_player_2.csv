"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's start with my offer of $100 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and Alice is offering $100. This is a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you control over the price and potentially gets a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $95. 
* **Accepting the offer saves you money.** This is a good deal considering your maximum willingness to pay.
* **There's no need to risk further negotiation.** While you could try to get a lower price, there's a chance Alice might reject your offer, leading to a longer negotiation and potentially a higher price from John."
