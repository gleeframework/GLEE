,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10,500. My revised offer is $11,250.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's a good deal for me and closer to your target than my previous offer.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more than that. My revised offer is $11,200. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  $11,200 is closer to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I may need to explore other options.",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident that it will bring significant benefits to your business. My revised offer is $11,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11500.0,Alice,7,
