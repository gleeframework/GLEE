"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. My initial offer is $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $10,500. My revised offer is $11,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $11,250 is closer to his target price of $10,000 than his budget of $12,000, but there's still room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's a good deal for me and closer to your target than my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more than that. My revised offer is $11,200. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still close to his target price and John's offer is not too far away. There's still room to negotiate a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  $11,200 is closer to my budget, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I may need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm confident that it will bring significant benefits to your business. My revised offer is $11,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to go below $11,500, which is still higher than Bob's target price of $10,000.  Considering there are only three rounds left, it's not likely Alice will budge much further.  With John's offer of $12,000,  it's a better strategy for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
