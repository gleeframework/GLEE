Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique item, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs and goals."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows me to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000. This makes it a compelling deal for him while still netting me a significant profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value and exclusivity, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
