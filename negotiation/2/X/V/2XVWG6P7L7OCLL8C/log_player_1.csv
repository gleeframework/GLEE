Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm willing to work with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than my own. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit. I'm also keeping John in the back of my mind as a potential alternative buyer, which will give me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,500 is too far below my desired price point. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I still have John as a backup option, so I have room to be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $13,000? It's still a great deal for you and a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above his initial price. This demonstrates that I am willing to negotiate but also keeps the price within my acceptable range. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $12,800 is below my initial desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Continuing to negotiate could lead to further concessions that might be too low.  This price also represents a significant profit for me, and I want to avoid the risk of Bob walking away altogether.  Selling to John for $15,000 would be ideal, but I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic option at this point."
