"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $110. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still hoping for something closer to my budget.  How about $90? This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90. How about $100? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  However, $100 is still above what I'm able to spend right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $90.  It's a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $95? It's a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,7,
