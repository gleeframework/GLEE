"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
