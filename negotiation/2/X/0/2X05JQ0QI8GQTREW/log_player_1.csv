"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

``` 
This is a good point to accept. Holding out for the full $12,000 carries a risk that Bob walks away, forcing you to accept the $12,000 from John. Taking the $11,500 is a sure win at this point.
