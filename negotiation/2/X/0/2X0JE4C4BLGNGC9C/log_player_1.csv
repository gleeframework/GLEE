Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation open. 
* **Potential for Counteroffer:** This price sets the stage for a counteroffer from Bob, allowing us to engage in a back-and-forth.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have the option to counter or go to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint, and I'd like to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I could accept and secure a sale, I believe there's potential for a higher counteroffer from Bob, or at least a compromise closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $900,000 to $850,000. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Midpoint:** The new offer is closer to Bob's price, increasing the likelihood of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $825000. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not certain I can push Bob further, and I'm at risk of him walking away.
* **Secure the Sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and ensures I don't have to rely on John, which could lead to a lower price.

**The risks of rejecting Bob's offer:**

* **Bob's Walk Away:**  He might get frustrated and walk away from the negotiation.
* **Lower Counteroffer:**  He might counter with a price lower than $825,000, forcing me into a less favorable position.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice at this point, balancing the potential for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal."
