{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting your minimum value for the product. It also invites negotiation, which is important to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  It's crucial to remember that your goal is to earn as much money as possible while acknowledging Bob's value assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum value of $150.  It's worth exploring if you can reach a more acceptable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $125?  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to counter with an offer of $110 for the product. This is my maximum budget for this purchase. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to your minimum value, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile. It's worth trying to push a little higher, and you still have the option of selling to John for $150 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $110 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider a final offer of $115?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
