Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at it by mentioning ""given its value."" This subtly suggests that the asking price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning that you'll list the product publicly if Bob declines, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity.  This might incentivize Bob to accept your offer rather than risk losing the opportunity. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, there's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer outright. If that happens, you still have the safety net of selling to John at your minimum acceptable price."
