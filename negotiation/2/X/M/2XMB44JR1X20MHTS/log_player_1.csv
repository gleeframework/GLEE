Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about $1,125,000? This would allow us both to walk away with a positive outcome."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we're getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'm confident that if I hold out a little longer, I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,115,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of what I'm offering.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1115000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $1,112,500 as a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as $1,112,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum goal of $1,200,000. However, considering:

* We are at round 6, leaving only 4 rounds for further negotiation.
* There's a good chance Bob won't increase his offer significantly further. 
* Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most financially rational decision at this point. It secures a solid profit and prevents risking a stalemate that could lead to a lower final offer."
