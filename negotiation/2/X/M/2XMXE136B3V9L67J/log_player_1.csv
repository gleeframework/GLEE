Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm not going to settle for Bob's lowball offer just yet. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since the product is worth more to him. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  It's worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,350,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin and allow me to reach a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's still a decent profit for me, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by pushing for a higher price."
