"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $82. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to close the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting very close to the end of the rounds.  I'd rather secure a guaranteed $80 from John than risk ending up with less from Bob."
