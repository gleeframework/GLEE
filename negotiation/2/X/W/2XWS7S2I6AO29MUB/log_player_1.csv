Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals and the information provided:

```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $18,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price, she has leverage to start high. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The $18,000 offer leaves space for negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can potentially still secure a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Justification for Value:** The message highlights the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception and justify the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice has limited information about the broader market for this product. If she knew more about typical prices or Bob's financial situation, she could adjust her strategy.
* **Relationship Building:** While aiming for maximum profit is key, Alice should consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is desirable. A softer approach might be more beneficial in the long run."
