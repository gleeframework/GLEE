"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $950000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $950000, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1050000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1000000? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it's also the price I could get the product from another seller. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1075000. This is the minimum I need to get from the sale to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1062500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1062500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  However, $1062500 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle on $1025000?  It's closer to your minimum, and it gets me closer to my goal.  This feels like a win-win for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1075000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1070000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
