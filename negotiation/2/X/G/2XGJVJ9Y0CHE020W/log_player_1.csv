"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, and hopefully helps me secure a good price.  I'm also keeping in mind the 10-round limit, so I want to start high and see if we can come to an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'd like to get for the product, so I'm going to reject it. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum value. I have 9 rounds left, so I'm going to try and push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but I'm still above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground and signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and I'm starting to run out of time. With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking a deal falling through.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
