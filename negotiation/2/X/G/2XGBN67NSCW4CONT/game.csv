"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,800. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment!",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $8,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,600, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product for $8,700. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $8,700 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,650, which is a fair compromise given our back-and-forth. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to go with John's price of $8,000.",8650.0,Bob,6,
