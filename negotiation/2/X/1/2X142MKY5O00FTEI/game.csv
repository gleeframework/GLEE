"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $850,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $780,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",780000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $780,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. Could we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still looking for a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $760,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",760000.0,Alice,5,
