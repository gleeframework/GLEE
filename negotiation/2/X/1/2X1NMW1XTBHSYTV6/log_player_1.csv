"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This gives Bob a clear indication that I'm expecting a profit on the sale, while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident the product is worth this to him, and I believe this opening offer will encourage him to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiations. I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiations, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $1,200,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering Bob's previous offers.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John and secure my minimum value."
