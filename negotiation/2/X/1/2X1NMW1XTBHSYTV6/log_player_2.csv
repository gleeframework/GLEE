{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price, so rejecting is the best option to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This offer is still below Bob's maximum price, but it signals Bob's serious intent to buy while also demonstrating that he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000. Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate, and there's still room for improvement.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob increases his offer slightly from the previous round, showing he's serious about buying but still trying to negotiate a lower price.  This offer is a compromise, bridging the gap between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and the deal could fall apart. Accepting at this point ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum price and avoids the risk of losing the deal.  It's also worth noting that John is also selling the product for $1,200,000, so accepting Alice's offer doesn't lose any potential savings."
