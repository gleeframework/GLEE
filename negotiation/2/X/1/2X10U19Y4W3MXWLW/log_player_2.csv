You can do better than $110, as you're willing to pay up to $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $108. I can do $113, and I think that's the best we can do without going below my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle!

You're only willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is now offering the product for $113.  This is a good deal for you, as it's below your maximum price. Accepting the offer is the best option."
