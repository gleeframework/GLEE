Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to try and gauge Bob's interest and see how he responds before potentially lowering the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, while also leaving some room for negotiation if he's still interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I would prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, it's important to ensure I get a fair price. John's offer guarantees that I achieve my minimum goal."
