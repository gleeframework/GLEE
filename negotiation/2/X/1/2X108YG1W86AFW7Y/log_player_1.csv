Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit, aiming for a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a backup buyer.  Therefore, you can afford to start high. However, being too aggressive might make Bob walk away immediately.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts by highlighting the product's value.
* **Strong but Negotiable:** $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to your desired range.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""significant returns,"" you subtly imply that the product is worth even more than Bob's perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (around $1,350,000) to give more negotiating room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you could be more transparent about having other offers while still aiming high. 

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
