"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer that he'll accept."
