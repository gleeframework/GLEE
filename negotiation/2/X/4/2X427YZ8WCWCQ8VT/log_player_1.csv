"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting with a high number ($1,600,000), you ""anchor"" the negotiation around that value. While Bob knows his valuation is lower, the initial high price can influence his perception of a ""good deal."" 
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:**  You have multiple rounds to negotiate, and starting high allows you to make concessions strategically throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gap:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still substantially lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  You have ample rounds remaining and the security of John's offer. This gives you leverage to reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price. 
* **Signaling:**  Accepting Bob's offer too quickly might make it seem like your initial price was unreasonable. Rejecting it signals that you're serious about obtaining a fair value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $950,000 and my valuation for this product is quite significant. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:**  You're making a significant concession from your initial price ($1,600,000 to $1,400,000) to demonstrate flexibility. However, you're still holding firm above your minimum ($1,200,000) and closer to your starting point.
* **Justification:**  You're not just throwing out a number; you're reiterating the value of the product to justify your counteroffer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language ""willing to negotiate"" and the question ""would you be willing to consider"" signals that you're open to further discussion and compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing you a profit.
* **Strong Position:** While you could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a favorable deal.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging the negotiation further has diminishing returns. Accepting now allows you to close the deal and potentially allocate resources elsewhere."
