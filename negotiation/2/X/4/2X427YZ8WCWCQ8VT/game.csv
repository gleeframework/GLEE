"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,600,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $950,000 and my valuation for this product is quite significant. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of what I'm offering. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
