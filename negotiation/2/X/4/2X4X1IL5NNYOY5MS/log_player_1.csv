Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000.  Let's try $10,750.  This feels like a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $10,750 is cutting it pretty close, and I might be better off exploring other options.  However, I value our conversation, so I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,900. This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a price close to your value.  I'm still determined to get this product, and I believe $10,800 is a fair compromise. It's a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer is getting close enough to my bottom line.  Continuing to push might irritate him, and while I could try for a slightly higher amount, there's a risk he walks away.  $10,800 is a reasonable profit, and it's better to secure the deal now."
