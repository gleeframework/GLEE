"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $12,250. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a solution. But unfortunately, I'm not comfortable with the price increase. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here. ",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,500. It's my minimum price, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $12,250 again, but this is my final offer on that price",12250.0,Alice,7,
