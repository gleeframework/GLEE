"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
