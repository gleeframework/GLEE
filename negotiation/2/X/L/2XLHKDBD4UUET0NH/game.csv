"Alice, thank you for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $850000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $700000 for the product. This price reflects my current needs and aligns with my maximum budget. I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775000. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a good profit while also being fair to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,
