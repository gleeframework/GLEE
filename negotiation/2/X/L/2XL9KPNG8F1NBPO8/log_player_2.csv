"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $125?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a lower price.  While $135 is a better deal than John's offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  Let's close the deal at this price, it's a fair price for both of us and I can make the purchase today."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we try to get closer to my minimum price? I'm willing to offer it to you for $132. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but at this point, it's getting risky to continue rejecting.  $132 is only slightly above his target of $125, and continuing to reject could lead to Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further, forcing Bob to either pay John's price of $150 or risk losing out on the product entirely.  Accepting Alice's offer at $132 is the most sensible choice at this point."
