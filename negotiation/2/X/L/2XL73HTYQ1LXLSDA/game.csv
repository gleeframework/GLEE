"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
