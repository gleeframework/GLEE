Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's getting close to the value I have in mind, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and it's better to secure the product at the known $80 price from John than to risk further negotiation."
