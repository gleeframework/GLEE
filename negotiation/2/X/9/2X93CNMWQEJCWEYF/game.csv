"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I need to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I need to sell the product for, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, but I think we both know that's not going to happen. I'll make one more serious offer: $9250. That's as low as I'm willing to go.
