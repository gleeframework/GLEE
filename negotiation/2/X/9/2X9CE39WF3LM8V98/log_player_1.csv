"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low.  It is worth more to me to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're willing to consider this."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $1700000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with that number.  I believe I can get a higher offer from Bob or John if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,300,000 is still below the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the significant value this product can bring to your business, and it's the closest I can go without compromising my own needs. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1550000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1420000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This offer is too low.  It's very close to my minimum price, but it's still not worth it to me to risk further negotiation.  The other buyer, John, is offering a price that is above my minimum price.   I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
