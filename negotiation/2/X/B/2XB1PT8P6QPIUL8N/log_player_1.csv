{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer close to Bob's valuation maximizes potential profit.  The offer of $1,300,000 gives Bob a $200,000 discount (making it more appealing) while netting you a significant gain above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. Bob knows you have other options if he refuses."
