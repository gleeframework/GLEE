"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16500. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the price. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $14500? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $14500 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
