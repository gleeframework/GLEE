"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about $105?  Let's see if we can make this work.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you being flexible.  $115 is closer, but I'm still a little higher than my budget allows.  How about $110?  I'm really hoping we can strike a deal!",110.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $112.50. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",112.5,Alice,5,
