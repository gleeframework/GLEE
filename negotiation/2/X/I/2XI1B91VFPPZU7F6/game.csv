"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115? It's still a fair price for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $115 is a fair offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my original price. Could you do $125?",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
