"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $130 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115? It's still a fair price for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $115 is a fair offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my original price. Could you do $125?
