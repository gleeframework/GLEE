# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our premium product.

For a limited time, I am willing to extend this offer at $950,000. This is a generous discount from its market value, designed to ensure you have the chance to secure such a valuable asset without breaking the bank. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with this offer. I look forward to the possibility of facilitating this transaction and bringing this product into your possession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling the product for $950,000, while John is selling it for $1,000,000.
* **You're still saving money:**  Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you're getting it for less from Alice. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to maximize your savings."
