"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm not quite ready to meet your initial price. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1300000.0
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $900,000, but I'm afraid it's a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a fair price for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1250000.0
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of a price of $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to you, while also being a reasonable price for me. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this point.",1250000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with that price.  My final offer is $1,150,000.  I think that's more than fair and allows both of us to benefit.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,240,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1240000.0,Alice,7,,
