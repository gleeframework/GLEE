,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? That would be a good deal for both of us and leave some room for negotiation.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $10,200?  That's a fair price, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're truly serious about buying this, I believe this is our best chance to make a deal.",10200.0,Alice,5,
