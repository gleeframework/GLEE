"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you countering, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $11,500? This reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be open to $10,500? That would be a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value finding a good deal for both of us, $10,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we settle at $11,000?  This reflects the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm ready to make a final offer. How about $10,750? If that works for you, we have a deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
