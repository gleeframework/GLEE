Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1150000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset for my company.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your interest, $1,050,000 is significantly below my expectations.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000.

Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $1075000.  This is a fair compromise, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product.  Let's try to work something out before it's too late.

While $1,075,000 is closer to my goal, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I want to try to push for a higher offer before considering John's deal."
