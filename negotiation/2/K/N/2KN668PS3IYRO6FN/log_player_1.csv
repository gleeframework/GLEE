Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a price significantly higher than John's offer. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your desired price. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer compromises by moving closer to Bob's offer while still aiming for a price higher than your minimum. It keeps the negotiation moving while staying firm on your desire to earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now higher than John's offer, and while it's still lower than your ideal price, it represents a decent profit. Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price."
