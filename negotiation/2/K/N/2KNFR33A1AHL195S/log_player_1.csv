{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows for some negotiation, but still gives me a decent profit. I'm willing to go lower than John's offer, but I want to maximize my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $11,000 is a bit low for me, considering its value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to sell it to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While $12,500 is closer, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$12,000 is a good price for me, and it seems Bob is firm on his offer.  I'd rather make the deal now than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a lower price."
