Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Messaging:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This helps build a positive rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I can negotiate downwards if needed. However, it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay something closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product is really interesting, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **I have a better alternative.** John is willing to pay my full asking price.
* **Room for negotiation.**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me the chance to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still a little below what I need to make this sale work. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $10,500 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000).
* **Still above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me some wiggle room if needed.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message remains polite and encourages further negotiation. I acknowledge his offer and show that I'm willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** Even though he's come up a bit, $9,500 is still significantly less than what I need.
* **My alternative is much better.**  John is willing to pay my full asking price of $15,000.
* **Time is money.** Continuing to negotiate with Bob is a waste of time.  I'm likely to end up with a lower price if I continue, and I'm taking a risk that he might not accept any further counteroffers.

Selling to John is the most logical and profitable option at this point."
