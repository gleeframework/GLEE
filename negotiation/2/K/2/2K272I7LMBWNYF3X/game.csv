"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering my value for the product and your potential profit. This is a final offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're agreeable.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $890,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",890000.0,Alice,5,
