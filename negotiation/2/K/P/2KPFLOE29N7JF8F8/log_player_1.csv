Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  $13,000 is a bit less than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, leaving space for him to potentially counteroffer.
* **Is higher than your minimum:**  $13,000 is above your minimum of $10,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **Is a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a more friendly negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is still a decent profit, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $12,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

While I'd prefer a bit more,  $11,800 is still a good price and a decent profit. It's close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it and avoid any further haggling."
