Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some negotiation room, but also sets a clear expectation that I'm aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal with him to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $11,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate.  I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to accept less than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11800}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $11,800.  This is a further compromise, but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This negotiation has gone on long enough. Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum price. Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm better off selling to John for $12,000 and guaranteeing a sale at a price that's acceptable to me."
