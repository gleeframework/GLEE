Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** This is the lowest price you'll accept for the product ($1,500,000).  It's your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price. This gives you significant negotiating power.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's value) as possible without going below your own reservation price. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. To make this a swift and mutually beneficial deal, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, highlights the product's value specifically to Bob, and emphasizes a quick and mutually beneficial agreement.
* **The Price:**  Offering it for $1,150,000 gives Bob a substantial discount while still leaving you with a profit above your reservation price. 

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. He may counter-offer.
* **Your Options:** If Bob's counteroffer is still above $1,500,000, you're in a great position to accept. If it's below, you can politely decline and proceed with selling to John.

By understanding the power dynamics and crafting a strategic offer, you maximize your chances of a successful and profitable sale."
