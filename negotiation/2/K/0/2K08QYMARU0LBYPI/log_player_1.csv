Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will pay the full $1,500,000,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it leaves room for negotiation. It also creates a sense of urgency and potential loss if Bob doesn't take the deal.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down or ultimately accept John's guaranteed offer."
