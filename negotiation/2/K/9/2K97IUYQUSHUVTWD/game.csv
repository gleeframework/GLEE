"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value proposition. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $950,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, how about we settle at $1,025,000? This still reflects the significant value this product holds.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $987,500. This price is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",987500.0,Bob,4,
