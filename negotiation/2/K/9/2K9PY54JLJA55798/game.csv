"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point.  I'm prepared to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13,750. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $13,750 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than where I can comfortably go.  I'd like to propose $13,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can close the gap here.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,5,
