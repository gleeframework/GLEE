"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of us.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $13,750. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, I'm still holding out for a lower price.  Since Alice is willing to negotiate, I think I can get closer to my target of $12,500. Rejecting allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is only $250 higher than my last counteroffer. At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant price reduction.  Considering that John is selling the product for $15,000,  Alice's offer is a good deal, and I'm better off accepting it."
