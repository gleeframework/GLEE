Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value. How about we meet at $16000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $14000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $15500? It's a price that's closer to your offer, and I'm willing to accept it if you're willing to meet me halfway.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500, can we meet at this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
