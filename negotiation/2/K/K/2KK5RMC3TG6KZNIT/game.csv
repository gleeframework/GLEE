"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $7500, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $8000. This is my final offer on that price point. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a final concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7500 and $8000, so I'll offer $7750 for the product. Can you consider that?",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $8000. I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I need to prioritize my own goals. I'll meet you at $7900, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",7900.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7900, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm sticking to my original offer of $7500. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to consider it.",7500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'll meet you at $7600, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't agree on this, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",7600.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making one last concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $7600. I'm going to make one final offer: I'll meet you at $7400. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $10000.",7400.0,Bob,10,
