Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $100?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
