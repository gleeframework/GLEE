"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I know it's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110 to meet you halfway. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $105 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $108.  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's try to make this happen.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I really think that's the most I can go. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",105.0,Bob,6,
