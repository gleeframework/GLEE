"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting at $150 gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **Openness:** Stating I'm open to negotiation encourages Bob to counter, allowing us to potentially reach a higher price than my minimum.
* **Positive Language:**  ""Fantastic product"" helps to build interest and value. 

**Note:**  I'm choosing to start high, as it's better to start high and negotiate down than to start low and have to negotiate up.  I also want to see if Bob has a high perceived value for the product before making concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I think we can negotiate a lower price. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is my absolute minimum.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $120.
* **Negotiation Space:** I've already stated my openness to negotiation, so it's reasonable to counter Bob's offer.
* **Potential for a Better Price:**  Bob is interested, so there's a possibility he'll go higher than $120 if I reject his offer. 

I'll try to counter with a price higher than $120, but lower than my initial offer of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. How about that?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** $135 is the midpoint between my desired price ($150) and Bob's offer ($120), making it a fair compromise.
* **Openness:** The message reiterates my openness to negotiation, indicating I'm still willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I think $125 would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiations:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $130, accepting this offer gives me a solid starting point for further negotiations with Bob if he's open to going higher.
* **Time Constraint:**  It's better to accept this offer than risk losing Bob as a buyer and potentially having to sell to John for $120, which would be the same price as Bob's offer.  

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure the deal and use the remaining rounds to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob."
