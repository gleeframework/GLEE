"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation. Since you have a higher valuation for the product, rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best possible deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now at $1,050,000, which is only $50,000 more than your counteroffer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and might not result in a significantly lower price. It's a good deal, and saves you a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
