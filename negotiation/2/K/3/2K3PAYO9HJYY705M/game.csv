"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start somewhere. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the potential in this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Let's start with a more realistic price.  I'm willing to offer you $800000.  This is a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's keep talking.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, and I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to consider it a serious offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1100000 is still a bit too high. I'm prepared to offer $1000000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm eager to make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more serious offer to try to reach a deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
