(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  He has only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will agree to his $12,000 limit.  John offers a guaranteed price that fits within Bob's budget.  It's better to be certain of the purchase than to risk losing the opportunity altogether."
