{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, as you know this product is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price, knowing that I can always come down a bit.  It's important to start strong and see where Bob lands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product is significant to you, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for $950,000 just yet. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with him.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle for $950,000. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm dropping my price a bit, but not by too much. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I believe we can still find common ground. I am willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a good deal for me, as it's above my floor price, and it seems likely he won't go higher.  I'm going to accept this offer."
