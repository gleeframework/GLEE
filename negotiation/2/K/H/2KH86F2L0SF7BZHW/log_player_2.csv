Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this price reflects the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?
