Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone might encourage Bob to consider my offer even if it's initially high.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not starting at my minimum price of $150, I'm acknowledging the potential for a counteroffer and keeping the negotiation open. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if Bob doesn't accept my offer or counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I need to make at least $150 to consider selling. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, he's still interested. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120? It's still a great price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is ""fantastic"" and a good value even at my price. 
* **Keep it friendly:** Maintaining a positive tone can help keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a profitable outcome.**  Bob is clearly aiming for a very low price, and it's unlikely he'll be willing to go much higher.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  I can sell to John for $150, which is my minimum and ensures I don't lose money.  

While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the potential gains with Bob are too small compared to the risk of wasting time and potentially getting a worse deal. Selling to John is the most logical and profitable choice in this situation."
