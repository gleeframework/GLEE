``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is above Bob's perceived value but allows some room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's $120, but I don't want to scare Bob away with an unreasonable initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $92 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $94.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 94}
