Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,200?"",
""product_price"": 10200
}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Alice's value. This gives us room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,450?"",

I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between our previous offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a reasonable price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Bob. In light of your offer, I'd like to propose a price of $10,600 for the product. This price aims to be fair for both parties, considering the value you see in the product and my need to maximize the sale price.

``` 

We're getting close, but I think we can still shave off a little more. Alice is clearly motivated to sell."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it. That's a fair offer."",

}
``` 

I'm nudging the price down slightly.  This keeps the negotiation moving and shows I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost."
