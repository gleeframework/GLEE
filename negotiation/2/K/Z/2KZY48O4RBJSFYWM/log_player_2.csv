"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  You should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That product looks great, but $14,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer lower than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a good deal.
* **Not Too Low:** Offering $10,500 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's not unreasonably low. It signals that you're serious about buying but want a fair price. 
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive tone throughout the negotiation is important."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, $13,000 is still above your target. 
* **Concession Shows Flexibility:** Alice reducing her price indicates a willingness to negotiate. You haven't reached an impasse yet.

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a more substantial price reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  To be honest, $12,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** This counteroffer is more direct and firm, indicating that $12,000 is your final offer.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""the highest I can go"") adds weight to your counteroffer and suggests you're nearing the limit of your budget. 
* **Leaves Room for Acceptance:**  It's still possible Alice will accept $12,000, as it represents a reasonable profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $13,500 is only slightly above your target price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Alice is signaling this is her final offer. If you push further, you risk her walking away from the negotiation.
* **Better Than John's Offer:** Accepting this offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John.

At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether."
