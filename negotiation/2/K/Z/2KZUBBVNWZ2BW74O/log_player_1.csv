Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that is slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $110.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I think he's being reasonable with his offer of $105. However, I'm not willing to sell it to him for that price, as it's still below my minimum price of $100.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price, but not too close, since Bob might still be willing to negotiate. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $108.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's original offer was $105, and I rejected it, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll offer it to him for $109.

{""product_price"": 109}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's making another offer. His new offer of $108 is very close to my minimum price of $100. I'm tempted to accept it, but I'm not sure if I can get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer again and make another counteroffer. I'll try to get even closer to my minimum price, but not quite reach it. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $106.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $108, and I rejected it, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than that. I'll offer it to him for $107.

{""product_price"": 107}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob rejected my last offer, and now he's making another offer. His new offer of $106 is very close to my minimum price of $100. I'm starting to think that I might not be able to get a better deal from Bob.

I'll accept Bob's offer. At this point, I think it's better to sell the product to Bob for $106 rather than risking that he might make an even lower offer or that I might not be able to sell it to him at all.
