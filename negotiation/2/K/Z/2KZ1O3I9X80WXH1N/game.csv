"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair considering the immense value this product offers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $1,100,000 is slightly out of my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,090,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
