"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,500 is below your maximum budget, you can get a better deal from John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for a counter-offer or can proceed with your alternative option."
