Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'm hoping Bob sees value in it and is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to split the difference between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and I'm hoping that this compromise will entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range, considering I can sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
