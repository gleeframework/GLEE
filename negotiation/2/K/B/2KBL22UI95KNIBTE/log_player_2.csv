Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a one-year warranty and a premium support package. The price remains at $1,050,000.

This is a tough one! Alice seems firm on her price, and while we could try to push further, there's a real risk she won't budge.  Getting the extras sweetens the deal somewhat. It's better to secure the product now at a price that's under our absolute limit, rather than risk her increasing the price or us having to settle for John's much higher price."
