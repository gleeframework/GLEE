"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
