"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to getting a good deal. Starting lower gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $9,000. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above your budget. You have room to negotiate further, and rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to get closer to your price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is the absolute top of my budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've shown you're serious about getting the product, but you're also holding firm on your budget.  By reiterating your offer, you're showing Alice that you're willing to walk away if necessary, which can put pressure on her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you're still $500 over your ideal price. You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown she's willing to come down. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $10,500 is still just a bit beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, but that's the absolute maximum I can do.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about getting the product while still keeping a buffer for a potential lower price from John.  You're also showing flexibility by raising your offer slightly, which could lead to a faster agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're making a strong effort to reach a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000, as that's the minimum I need to make on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,750 is still above your ideal price of $10,000. You've already spent several rounds negotiating and it's unlikely Alice will come down further.  Given that you have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $10,000, it's more efficient to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John. This saves you time and potentially further negotiation headaches."
