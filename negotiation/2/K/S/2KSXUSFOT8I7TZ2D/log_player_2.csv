Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but $75 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. How about we meet at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $78 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $118, which is the highest I can go without selling to John for $120. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut the losses. Alice has made it clear she won't go below $115, and she even mentioned John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go lower. Taking the guaranteed $80 from John is the best move at this point."
