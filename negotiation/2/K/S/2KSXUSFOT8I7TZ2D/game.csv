"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about $75?  That's the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a deal, but $75 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $120 for the product. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close.  I'll budge a little higher to $78, but that's really the absolute limit for me.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $78 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $118, which is the highest I can go without selling to John for $120. Let me know if that works for you.",118.0,Alice,7,
