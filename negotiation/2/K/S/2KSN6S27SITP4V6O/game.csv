"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that much, but I think it's the most I can afford. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a fair price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000. This is a significant investment for both of us, and I believe this price reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
