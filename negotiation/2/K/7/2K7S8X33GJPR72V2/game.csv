"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents my initial assessment of the product's value, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects a significant reduction on my part while still ensuring a fair return on this unique product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
