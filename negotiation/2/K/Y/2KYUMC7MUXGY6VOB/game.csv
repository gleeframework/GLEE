"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $20000. This is a great opportunity to acquire something truly special. Let me know your thoughts!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $12000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $16000? This allows me some wiggle room while still respecting your budget. Let me know if this works for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but I'm still a bit stretched. Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $14000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $14000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to go up to $14500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  Let's go with my last offer of $14000.  I'm confident this is a fair price, and it allows us to close this deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
