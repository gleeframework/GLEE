,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $8,800 is closer, but I'm still feeling a bit stretched.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,900?  That seems like a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",8700.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  With only a few rounds left, I'm going to need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. It's our last chance to come to an agreement before I move on to another buyer.",8800.0,Alice,7,
