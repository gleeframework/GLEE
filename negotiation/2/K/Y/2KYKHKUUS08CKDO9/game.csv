"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's start the negotiation here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. How about $875,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly recognize the value this product offers. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This feels like a good compromise for both of us.",887500.0,Alice,5,
