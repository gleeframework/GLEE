"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to go lower before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's start the negotiation here."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - let's settle on $900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer, especially considering John's offer as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. How about $875,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly recognize the value this product offers. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This feels like a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting close to Bob's desired range. While there is still room for negotiation, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  If Bob continues to counteroffer and Alice rejects, he might risk pushing her away or running out of rounds.  

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for a reasonable price, saving him $112,500 compared to buying from John."
