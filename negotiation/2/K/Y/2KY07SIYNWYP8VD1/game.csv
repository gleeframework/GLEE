"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $6500, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I can offer it to you for $7000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $6800, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",6800.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $6800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $7200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",7200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $7200. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $6800 as a compromise. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me at $6800?",6800.0,Bob,6,
