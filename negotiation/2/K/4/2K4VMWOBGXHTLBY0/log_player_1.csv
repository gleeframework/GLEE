Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer takes into account the product's unique benefits and ensures a win-win situation for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,350,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $1,200,000.  It's time to apply more pressure and see if he's willing to move closer to our desired price. We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward. This product has significant value, and  $1,200,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,275,000, but that's my final offer. This presents a great opportunity for you, and I'd hate for you to miss out."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While it's not ideal to go below $1,250,000, Bob is consistently showing he won't budge past the $1,200,000 mark. Accepting $1,225,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely. It's better to make a deal now than potentially end up with John's lower offer later."
