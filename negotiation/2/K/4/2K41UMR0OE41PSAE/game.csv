"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you.  I can come down a bit to $9000.  This still leaves me room to make a fair profit, and I think it's a good price for a product worth $10000 to you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $8750 is a fair offer, but I need to be able to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $8875?  It's a fair compromise for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
