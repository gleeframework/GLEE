Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm still confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $13,500. This is a fair price that should meet your budget, and I'm willing to sell the product at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Reason: While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $13,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, saving me at least $1,500 and further negotiation hassle."
