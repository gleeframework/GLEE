"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is way above his maximum budget of $120. It's best to counteroffer or even consider buying from John immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $120? "", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $165. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $165 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate further or consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now if you agree."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's already been through multiple rounds of negotiation and Alice is unwilling to drop below $150. This is still above Bob's preferred price, and he's already established that he's willing to pay $120.  It's better to take the sure thing and buy from John."
