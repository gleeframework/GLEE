{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $8,500 is below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $9,000 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my minimum.  There's always a risk of him rejecting my next counteroffer or me losing out to John, so it's a good time to close the deal."
