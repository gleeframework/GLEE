"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  Given the product's quality and its value, I'd be willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure I get a fair price.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product, as I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
