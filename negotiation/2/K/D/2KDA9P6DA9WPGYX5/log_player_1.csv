``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $9,500.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,200 is a good deal and more than John is offering.  It's time to close the deal."
