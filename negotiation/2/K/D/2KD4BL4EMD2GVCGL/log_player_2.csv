"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is a better price than $120, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can potentially secure a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best price possible. While $95 is a better price than $100, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price. There are still multiple rounds left, so there's time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
