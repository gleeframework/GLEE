"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's beneficial for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000, you know you have another option with John. There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or get the product for your maximum budget from John."
