"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $150?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
