"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $1,300,000 is quite steep. I'd be willing to start the conversation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, anything over $800,000 is pushing my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? It's a fair offer that recognizes the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your budget considerations.",950000.0,Alice,5,
