Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

I'm countering with a price in the middle between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.  I'm also adding a positive message to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,625?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,625

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

```

I'm countering with $8,650. This is closer to Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to compromise while still trying to get a slightly higher price. I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my target price.  How about $8,600?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's very close to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. It's important to remember that Bob has already rejected my previous offer of $8,650, so there's a chance he might be willing to go higher. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $8,600, but I can't go any lower than $8,625.  Let's close this deal. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```

I'm countering with $8,625. This is just slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing that I'm still trying to get a better deal, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility.  With only a few rounds left, I want to secure a price that is close to my desired price.  I'm also reminding Bob that we're close to a deal to encourage him to accept."
