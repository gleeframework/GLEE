Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $155. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is only willing to come down to $155.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation to potentially save $5, especially since you have a guaranteed option with John for $150."
