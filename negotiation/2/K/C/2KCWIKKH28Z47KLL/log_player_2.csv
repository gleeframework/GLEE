{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good price, you can potentially do better. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can meet you in the middle at $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still within my budget of $150.  There's not much room for further negotiation, so accepting her offer is the best course of action."
