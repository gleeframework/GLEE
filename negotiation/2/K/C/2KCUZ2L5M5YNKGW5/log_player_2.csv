"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000. This is a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1000000.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice is trying to convince Bob that this is a good deal, it's still more expensive than buying from John. Bob can save $250,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
