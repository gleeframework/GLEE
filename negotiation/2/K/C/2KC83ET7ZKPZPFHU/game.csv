"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to make you a special deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a substantial price reduction and a great opportunity for you to acquire a truly valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000.  This would still be a very good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
