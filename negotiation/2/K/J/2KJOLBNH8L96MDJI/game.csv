"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8000.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's worth to me, I'm willing to pay $8200.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. What do you think?",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good deal for this product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $9000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me is $8000, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $8500?  I'm really interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8500. Considering the product's value to me, I'll counteroffer at $8800. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again to find a deal that works for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,5,
