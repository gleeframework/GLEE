"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11000?  That's still a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10800 to make this work.  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I appreciate your honesty. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $10100? It's a good middle ground and I think you'll be happy with the product at that price. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $9000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to see some movement from your end.",9000.0,Bob,8,
