# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price that is fair for both of us. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us. I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
