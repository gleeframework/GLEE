You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you seem really keen on this and I want to be fair.  My absolute limit is $12,200. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,200.  Continuing to negotiate might annoy her, and any savings I might eke out are probably not worth the risk of losing the deal."
