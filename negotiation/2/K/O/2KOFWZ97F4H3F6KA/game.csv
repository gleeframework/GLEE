"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $950,000 is getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,
