"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still aiming for a high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I can likely get more by continuing the negotiation. I'm not in a rush and can always sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180} 
```

I'm offering $180 to Bob, aiming to split the difference between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $170 is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating, there's always the risk that he'll reject my counteroffer, or that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
