"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your interest. However, $800000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This represents a significant discount while still allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of the product's worth. Let's continue this conversation to find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
