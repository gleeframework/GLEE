{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $150 to me, and Alice's offer is too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $130, which is still below my maximum budget and hopefully attractive enough for Alice to consider."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $140, showing willingness to compromise but still staying within my budget. Hopefully, this will be enough for Alice to accept."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still over my budget. I've already had a few rounds of negotiations, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a lower price. It's better to secure the product now for a price I'm comfortable with."
