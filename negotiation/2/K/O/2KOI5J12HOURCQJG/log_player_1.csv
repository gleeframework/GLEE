"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll be ready to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is far too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with something closer to my initial price.  I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price considering his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject and counter-offer again.  I need to see if I can get him closer to my desired price or if it's time to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in the product and accept.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay what the product is worth to me. Even though his offer is getting closer, I've already made significant compromises.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 is a much better option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk getting stuck with a lower price."
