"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and still leaves Alice with a profit of $100,000.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially increasing the price again, or even walking away from the deal, is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
