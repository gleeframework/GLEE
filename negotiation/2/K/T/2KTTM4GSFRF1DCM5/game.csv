"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but $14,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $16,500. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $15,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. I'll throw in a special bonus that's worth $500, which will bring the total value to $16,500. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
