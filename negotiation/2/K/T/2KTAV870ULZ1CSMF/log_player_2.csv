"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,850,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."

{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $1,000,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer, we can gauge Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is closer to our target price and significantly below Alice's starting price, setting the stage for a potential compromise. 
* **Respectful Tone:** While the offer is low, the message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, considering the product's potential value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than both our target price and John's offer.  We need to signal that we're serious about a lower price point and willing to walk away if necessary."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? I feel this is a fair offer, reflecting a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** We increase our offer to $1,100,000, showing movement and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Below John's Price:** This offer is now slightly below what John is offering, putting pressure on Alice to consider a price closer to our target.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  We continue to frame our offer as mutually beneficial, aiming for a win-win outcome."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above John's price.  We're in a strong position to push for a price closer to our $1,200,000 target.  By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about our budget and willing to walk away if necessary."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I'm very close to being able to agree to a deal.  Would you be willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product? I believe that's a very fair offer and allows us both to benefit from this transaction."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're matching John's price, making it our best and final offer.  
* **Clear Justification:** We're clearly stating why we believe this price is fair.
* **Polite but Firm:** We're maintaining a polite tone but firmly indicating that this is our limit.

This strategy aims to:

2. **Maintain a Positive Relationship:** We want to avoid being overly aggressive, as a good relationship with Alice could be beneficial in the future. 

This offer gives Alice a final chance to make a deal while making it clear that we're ready to walk away and purchase from John if necessary."
