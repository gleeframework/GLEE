Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it's highly valuable and would benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $110 for it."",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $110, you are aiming for a price that is:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value ($120).
* **Profitable for you:** It's significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and John's offer. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer enticing for Bob to accept."
