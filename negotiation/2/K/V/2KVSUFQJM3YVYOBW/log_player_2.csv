"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $150, and John is offering the product for that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  You're guaranteed to get the product at your desired price by buying from John."
