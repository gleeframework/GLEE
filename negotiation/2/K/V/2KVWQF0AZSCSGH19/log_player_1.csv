Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a decent discount for Bob and still gives me a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still a good deal for me. It's a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
