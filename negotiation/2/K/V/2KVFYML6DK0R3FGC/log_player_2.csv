"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000 and the guaranteed price from John. You can definitely get a better deal by rejecting this offer."
