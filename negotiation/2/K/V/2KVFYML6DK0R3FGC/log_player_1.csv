Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for the price (even if vague about the ""value"") makes it seem less arbitrary to Bob.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest and leave the door open for negotiation.  If he's completely turned off by the price, he'll likely counter-offer or walk away. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum ($12,000) and have John as a backup buyer."
