"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but I think your starting price is a little high.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can see that you're willing to pay a significant amount for the product, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, which is the lowest I can go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your honesty about your final offer. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but I need to consider the value of the product and my own needs. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
