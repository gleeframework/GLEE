"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception that the product is highly valued.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  The initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His reaction will guide your subsequent strategies. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 provides a safety net. You can afford to negotiate more assertively with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it holds, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. Would you consider $1,800,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than our desired selling price. We have room to negotiate and try to close the gap. We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps us closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but the value this product brings is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to our initial ask. It's a common tactic to split the difference in negotiations.
* **Maintaining Value:** We don't want to drop the price too drastically too quickly, as that could signal we're desperate or that the product is worth less than we initially claimed.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still early in the negotiation (Round 3), so we have time to strategically counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that the product should be within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now $300,000 below our initial ask and only $200,000 above John's guaranteed offer. While we want to secure the best possible price, we need to be mindful of the diminishing returns. We'll counter with a price closer to John's offer to signal we have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I have to be upfront. This product is in high demand, and I have another potential buyer ready to purchase at a price very close to my current offer.  I'm willing to consider $1,750,000 as a final offer. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you. "",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer, we introduce a sense of urgency and competition for the product. This might encourage Bob to be more flexible.
* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Presenting this as our ""final offer"" adds weight to the negotiation and suggests that we're nearing the limit of our flexibility.
* **Strategic Compromise:** While close to John's offer, $1,750,000 is still a significant gain compared to Bob's previous offer and allows for a potentially more profitable outcome than selling to John directly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway. I propose a final price of $1,650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Outcome:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a significant profit above our minimum selling point of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a good deal.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations further could lead to lost opportunities. Accepting a solid offer now allows us to move forward."
