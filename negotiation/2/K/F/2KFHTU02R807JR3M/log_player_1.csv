"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price ($10,000) to give me room to negotiate down. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's best to start high and see what his reaction is. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiation to encourage him to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more.  I will reject his offer and counter-offer to see if I can close the deal for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 isn't quite where I need to be on this.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8500. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise, and it's only $500 less than my initial counter-offer. I'm willing to accept this to avoid risking further negotiations and potentially losing out on a sale.  It's important to be realistic and recognize a good deal when I see one."
