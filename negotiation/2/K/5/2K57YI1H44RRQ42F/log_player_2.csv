"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to its true value to you, while still providing me with a return that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
