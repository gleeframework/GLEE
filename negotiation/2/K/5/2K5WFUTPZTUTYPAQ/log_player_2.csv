"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is a decent price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $105 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still higher than Alice's minimum, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for under $110. While $115 is closer to his goal, it's still not quite there.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $110. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That way, we both get something we're happy with."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a compromise that's closer to Alice's last offer, but still keeps him under his $110 limit. This shows a willingness to be reasonable while maintaining his own negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $117, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $117 is still over Bob's $110 limit.  Bob is determined to get a better deal and sees an opportunity to continue negotiating since he has more rounds available. He believes he can still find a price that works for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $117 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay under $110. How about we try $113.50? It's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 113.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price below $110.  By offering $113.50, he's again splitting the difference between his last offer and Alice's. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $119, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $119 is still above Bob's desired $110 limit. With only a few rounds left, Bob has two options:

* **Continue Negotiating:** He could keep making counter-offers, but the risk is that Alice might not budge further, and he'll be left with a price he's not happy with.
* **Buy from John:** Since John offers the product for $120, this is a safer option. While it's slightly above Bob's ideal price, it's still within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation.

Considering the limited rounds and the possibility of a stalemate with Alice, Bob chooses to buy from John to ensure he gets the product without exceeding his maximum limit."
