,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $105 for the product. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $115 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $110. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  That way, we both get something we're happy with.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $117, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",117.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While $117 is closer, I'm still hoping to stay under $110. How about we try $113.50? It's a fair compromise and gives us both a good deal.",113.5,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $119, which is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",119.0,Alice,7,
