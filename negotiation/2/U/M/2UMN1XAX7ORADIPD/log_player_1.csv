{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $12,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  It's below your minimum value of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate and potentially come to a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a back and forth negotiation. 

I will adapt my future offers based on Bob's responses and will switch to selling to John if the negotiation doesn't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
