"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 represents a fair valuation given its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this offer bridges the gap and reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
