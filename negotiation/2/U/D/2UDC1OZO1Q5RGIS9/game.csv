"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,400,000? That's still a great price for a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit far off from $1,400,000. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still trying to find a sweet spot. How about $1,200,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible without breaking the bank.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
