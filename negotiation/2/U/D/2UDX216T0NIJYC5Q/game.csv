"Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit above my budget.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. I'm still willing to negotiate. How about $110? It's a good compromise for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to come down to $109.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $109 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $108? It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
