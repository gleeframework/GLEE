"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1400000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1600000. It's a fair middle ground, considering the product's value. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to walk away if I can't meet your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm willing to make one last offer: $1550000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
