"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This is a significant discount and leaves room for further negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum price, but there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'd like to start closer to my target price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me and gives us both room to work with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're both committed to making this happen.  However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This price allows for a fair return on my investment and keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial outcome.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like, but it's significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer allows me to save $400,000 compared to buying from John. There's a risk of getting a slightly better deal if I keep negotiating, but the potential gains are not worth the risk of losing this opportunity."
