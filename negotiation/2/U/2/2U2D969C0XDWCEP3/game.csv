"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This is a significant discount and leaves room for further negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'd like to start closer to my target price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me and gives us both room to work with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're both committed to making this happen.  However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This price allows for a fair return on my investment and keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial outcome. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,
