"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value and the benefits it brings, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
