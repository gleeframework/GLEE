"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  My starting price is $1,750,000. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is just too far below what this product is worth to me.  Let's try $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering my value and your stated interest. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,400,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but $1,250,000 just isn't going to work for me. How about we compromise at $1,350,000? This is a fair price considering our previous offers, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the same price I offered in round 2. I think this is a fair price considering our previous offers. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
