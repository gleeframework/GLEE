Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it can significantly benefit you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  This is a rare opportunity to own something truly special."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a significant profit, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. We are still in the early stages of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe my initial offer was already quite fair. The value this product brings is undeniable. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to $1,325,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1325000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Hold Firm:** While showing some flexibility, it reinforces the product's value and emphasizes that Alice is willing to negotiate but won't drastically lower the price.
* **Apply Pressure:** By stating it's her final offer, Alice introduces a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to consider the deal more seriously.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By coming down slightly less than Bob's counteroffer ($100,000 vs. $200,000), Alice maintains a stronger negotiating position. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while considering the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely by pushing further."
