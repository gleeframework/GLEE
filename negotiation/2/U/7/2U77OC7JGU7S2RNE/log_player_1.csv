"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is quite tight. I would like to propose a price of $700,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $700,000 is closer to what I can afford. Let's try $750,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. Holding firm and rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better deal in the next round. We're getting closer to John's offer, but there's still room to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need a price that reflects the true worth of this product.  Let's settle at $825,000, and we have a deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad you're sticking to the value of the product. I'll make one last offer of $775,000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's latest offer is still below John's guaranteed offer. There's little incentive to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's made it clear he's unwilling to meet a price point that's significantly beneficial to us. It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer for the guaranteed $800,000."
