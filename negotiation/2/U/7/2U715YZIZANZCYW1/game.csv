"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $130 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my minimum selling price.  Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130 again? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price.",130.0,Bob,4,
