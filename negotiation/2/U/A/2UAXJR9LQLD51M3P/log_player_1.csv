{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $12,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'll try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm going to make a counteroffer of $12,500. This is only $500 above my minimum, showing I'm serious about selling but also that I believe the product is still worth more than $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $11,500.  This is a compromise, but it still keeps me above my minimum value. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum, and I've already made several counteroffers.  With only a few rounds left, it's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
