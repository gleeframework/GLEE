"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It's a good starting point to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in buying if you could come down to $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $150? It's a fair price for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
