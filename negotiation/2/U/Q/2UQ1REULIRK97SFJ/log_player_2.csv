"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product that I think could be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for a price of $2000000.  This is a one-time opportunity to acquire something truly unique. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice is claiming the product will be sold to another buyer for $1,500,000, it's better to wait and buy from John for $1,000,000. This strategy saves Bob $1,000,000."
