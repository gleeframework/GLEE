"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $100 is a good price for me, it still leaves room for Bob to negotiate downwards. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Counter-Offer:** I have room to counter-offer and hopefully reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is a guaranteed $80,  I'm optimistic that I can get a better deal with Bob, especially since he expressed interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway.  
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and friendly.
* **Price Point:** $95 is a good middle ground and gives Bob a small discount from my initial offer while still allowing me to earn more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm still interested. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $92.50 is a good compromise, significantly higher than John's offer of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price without unnecessary risk. 
* **Time Factor:** With only 6 rounds left, it's wise to secure a deal that benefits me while there's still time."
