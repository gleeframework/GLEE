Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?

* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
