"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a price that is more appealing to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to his price point, I'm still not quite at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with another offer, hoping we can reach a deal soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm not getting my ideal price from Bob, I'm concerned that we're getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers and I'm running out of time.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and I'd rather take that certainty than risk losing more rounds with Bob and possibly getting a lower price."
