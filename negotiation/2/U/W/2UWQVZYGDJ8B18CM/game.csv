"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. Let's find a middle ground. How about $875,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my position. To be frank, $800,000 is my absolute floor, and I have another buyer ready at that price. However, I value our discussions and believe you'll gain immense value from this product. Let's close this deal at $850,000, and we can both walk away happy.",850000.0,Alice,5,
