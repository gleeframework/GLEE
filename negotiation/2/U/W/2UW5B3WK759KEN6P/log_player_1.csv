Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $15,000. While it's my minimum value, I believe the product is worth more. I'm counter-offering with $17,500. This is a compromise, offering a lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. I hope this will encourage Bob to continue negotiating and potentially meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $14,000 is too low. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum value and ensures I don't lose out on the deal."
