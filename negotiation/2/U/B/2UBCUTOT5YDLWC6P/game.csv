"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be open to something closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
