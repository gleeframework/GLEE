"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and endeavors. Given its exceptional value and quality, it is worth $15,000 to you, and I am confident it will exceed your expectations. I am offering you this opportunity to acquire it at a special price of $12,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an excellent value compared to the market rate. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you're ready to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $12,000.** This is still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000) but less than your maximum budget ($15,000).
* **You can get the product for $15,000 from John.** This is your maximum budget, but it means you don't have to negotiate with Alice.
* **Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $15,000.** While you're spending your maximum, you avoid the potential for a longer negotiation with Alice and the possibility of her refusing to lower the price further."
