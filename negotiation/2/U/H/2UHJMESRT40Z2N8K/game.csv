"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit out of my price range, though. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about $110? That's closer to what I had in mind.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $115? It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,

"You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  I'll meet you halfway at $112.50. That's the best I can do.",112.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm still not convinced that $112.50 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we try $118? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",118.0,Alice,7,
