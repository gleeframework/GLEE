"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking for $170 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave room for negotiation. It's also a bit higher than my minimum desired price, but I'm willing to adjust if he doesn't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $150. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about $115? That's a decent compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below what I know the product is worth to me. I'm not ready to sell it at this price. I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $130. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit more. How about $120? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is exactly what the product is worth to him, and while it's not my ideal price, it's within my minimum acceptable range. It's also the highest offer he's made so far, and I don't want to risk losing this deal and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
