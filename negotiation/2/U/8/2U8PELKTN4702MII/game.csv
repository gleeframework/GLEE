"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While that product is worth a great deal to me, I'm willing to come down some to find a good middle ground. How about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $987,500 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",987500.0,Bob,4,
