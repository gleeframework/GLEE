"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to say that $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair middle ground, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
