"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am currently working with a tight budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below my bottom line for this product. It's truly unique and valuable.

This offer represents a significant concession on my part, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. However, there's still a gap to bridge. To be clear, this product is uniquely valuable, and I have another offer on the table.  However, I value finding an agreement with you. I'm willing to consider $1,950,000 as my final offer. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
