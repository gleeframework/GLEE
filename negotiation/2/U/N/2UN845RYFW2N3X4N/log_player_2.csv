Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000.

Alice has met you halfway, and at $1,100,000 you're getting a good deal. It's worth accepting the offer before you risk pushing her further and having to buy from John at a higher price."
