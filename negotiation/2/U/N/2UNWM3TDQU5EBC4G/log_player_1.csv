"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Considering its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant value it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:** We keep in mind our backup offer from John ($800,000) as a safety net if negotiations don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Therefore, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably below our target and his perceived value. We have room to negotiate, especially since we have eight rounds left. Selling to John at this point would be leaving a substantial sum on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value this product brings to the table is significant. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial proposal, how about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Aim High, Justified:** The counteroffer splits the difference, keeping the price significantly above Bob's offer while still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Strong Justification:** We reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Maintain Pressure:** We don't want to concede too much too quickly, maintaining a strong stance encourages Bob to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but I still feel that $950,000 is a fair price given my budget constraints. I would like to stick to this figure. Thank you for considering my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $950,000, but we still have ample room for negotiation and time before considering John's offer. It's too early to settle, especially since we know the product's worth significantly more to Bob. We need to show him we're willing to walk away if he doesn't budge closer to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your budget, but I also need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  Let's try this â€“ $1,000,000. It's a significant investment, but the value you'll gain will far outweigh the cost.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're moving closer to Bob's offer with a round number ($1,000,000) to signal we're willing to compromise, but only to a certain point. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** We're reiterating the value proposition to reinforce the idea that the product is worth the investment.
* **Direct Approach:** The tone becomes more direct (""What do you say?"") to encourage a response and potentially break the stalemate.
* **Time Consideration:**  We're halfway through the rounds and need to apply more pressure while we still have leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still aim to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $975,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer! Bob is now incrementally increasing his offer, showing movement towards a more agreeable price. We are still comfortably above John's offer, and we have four more rounds to try to nudge Bob closer to the $1,000,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show you I'm serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and accommodates your budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By stating ""This is my final offer,"" we aim to expedite the negotiation and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Strategic Concession:** We are making a smaller concession this round, signaling we're reaching our lower limit.
* **Balance of Firmness and Flexibility:** While firm on the price, we reiterate our understanding of his budget and willingness to close the deal.
* **Time Constraint:** With only three rounds remaining, we need to push for a decision and consider John's offer if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. My final counteroffer is $980,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Bob has countered with a final offer of $980,000. While not our ideal price, it's a substantial amount, significantly exceeding John's standing offer. 

Here's why accepting makes the most sense:

* **Strong Profit:** $980,000 is a $180,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer. Continuing carries the risk of losing him altogether. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We only have two rounds left, and pushing further might not yield a better outcome. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a very good deal at this point."
