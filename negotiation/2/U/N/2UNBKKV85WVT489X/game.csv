"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1500000 for this product, given its potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1500000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment with the potential for substantial returns.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000 to show my commitment to working with you.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to benefit from this opportunity. ",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1600000.  This price represents a fair value for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
