"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too close to our maximum budget. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $140 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, we're still aiming to get it lower. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $120? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

We're getting closer. This offer splits the difference between our last offer and her current one. It represents a significant saving and is a strong negotiating point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $125 is a good price, especially considering John's alternative offer of $150. It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
