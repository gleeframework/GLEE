Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 99}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $100 as possible, but I also want to make the sale to Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is a common psychological pricing tactic. It feels significantly less than $100 to Bob, making it more enticing. 
* **Backup Offer:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I know I can sell it to John for $100, so I'm not losing out."
