Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. He has only three rounds left, and there's a risk that Alice might not budge further. Since he can get the product from John for $120, which is within his budget, it's better to secure the deal with John.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially missing out on a good deal."
