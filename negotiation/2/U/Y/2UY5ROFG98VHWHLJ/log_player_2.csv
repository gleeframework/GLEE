"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($8,000) and John's offer ($8,000).  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Significant Difference:** A $5,000 offer creates a significant gap from both Alice's asking price and your maximum budget. This signals that you're serious about negotiating but also that you see value in the product.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $13,000 remains significantly above your $8,000 budget and John's offer.
* **Alice is Negotiating:**  The fact that Alice came down in price suggests she's open to negotiation.
* **Room for Movement:** There's still a considerable gap between your offer and hers, indicating room for further negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I could go up to $6,500. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging my financial limits."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  By increasing your offer to $6,500, you demonstrate willingness to move towards Alice's price point, but at a controlled pace.
* **Staying Below John:** It's crucial to keep your offers below John's $8,000 price to maintain a negotiating advantage with Alice. 
* **Clear Communication:**  You're clearly stating your budget limitations while expressing continued interest in the product. This encourages Alice to propose a counteroffer within a more reasonable range."
