Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** I'm hinting that there might be aspects of the product Bob hasn't fully considered, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me a strong position in the negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $5,000 is far below both my minimum ($12,000) and his own perceived value ($8,000). This suggests he's trying to lowball me. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between his offer and what I'm willing to accept. Rejecting this offer gives us space to negotiate further.
* **Backup Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives me leverage. I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:**  I'm making a substantial reduction from my initial offer to show flexibility. However, I'm still staying well above my absolute minimum of $12,000. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that the product has value beyond what Bob might currently perceive. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and understand if he's willing to negotiate within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. I could go up to $6,500. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's offer increased, but it's still far below my minimum. His incremental increases suggest he's unlikely to meet my valuation.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. There's no further risk of negotiation or a lower offer from Bob.
* **Time Value:** Prolonging negotiations with Bob wastes time that I could use to finalize the sale with John."
