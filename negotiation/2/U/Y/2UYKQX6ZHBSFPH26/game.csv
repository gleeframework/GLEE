,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the deal, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be realistic about the market value. I'll give you $1200000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1700000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1350000 for the product. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1350000 is still below what I need to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final concession.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your limitations.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this offer.  I'll accept $1450000 for the product.  This is a final offer. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1450000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1420000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1420000.0,Bob,8,
