"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This gives me some room to negotiate and see if Bob is willing to pay more than he initially thought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to keep negotiating. However, I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have a chance to get a better price with more rounds of negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm now offering my minimum price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round to guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Since I've already reached my minimum price and Bob's offer is still below it, I'm going to sell to John. It's better to secure my minimum value than to risk getting a worse price or running out of negotiation rounds."
