Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I am still committed to staying within my budget. I would like to propose $12,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value to me.

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and while he's moving up slightly, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed $15,000."
