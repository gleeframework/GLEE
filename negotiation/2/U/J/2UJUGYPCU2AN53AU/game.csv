"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a real game-changer and I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm starting at $1,750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's talk!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will provide significant value for you. Let's make this deal happen!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
