Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $95 is higher than Bob's $80 value, but not so high that it's immediately rejected.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $95 is still above your $100 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.  Let's try to close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident I'll be able to get him to agree to my price.  Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum profit and saves me time and energy."
