"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $90 for this product? ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $110? It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $110 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? ",105.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to make it worth your while.",115.0,Alice,5,
