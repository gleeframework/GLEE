"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Based on its potential, I'm offering it to you at a price of $850000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $850,000, which is $50,000 more than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $800,000, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
