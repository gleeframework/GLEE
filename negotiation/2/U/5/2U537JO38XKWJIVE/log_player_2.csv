"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,500 is a good price, you can likely get it lower. It's always worth negotiating, especially since you have 10 rounds and a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** By going significantly lower than Alice's offer, you show you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Motivating Factor:** A lower price motivates Alice to negotiate further and potentially reach a middle ground.
* **Room for Compromise:** You still have room to move up in price if necessary during the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you consider meeting halfway at $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  $13,750 is still above your desired price point. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate allows you to potentially get a price closer to your target of $13,000.
* **Remaining Rounds:** You have ample rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,750 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $13,250.  This feels fair considering the value and our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** You're offering a price that's closer to Alice's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Argument:** You're framing your offer as a ""fair"" compromise, appealing to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $13,250 is in the middle of your last offer and Alice's last offer, making it a more appealing option for both parties."
