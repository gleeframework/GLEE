"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  My initial offer is $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards and potentially reach a price that's still profitable for me. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the potential benefits of the product for Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by inviting Bob to share his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price.** While I could sell to John for this amount, I'm not getting any profit from it. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** There's a good chance that Bob is willing to pay more than $12,000. By rejecting his offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to negotiate with Bob and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is definitely too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by making a counter-offer.
* **Middle Ground:** $15,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm signaling that I'm open to compromise by suggesting finding ""common ground."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit Margin:** $13,500 is still a good price, but it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable price. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial goal. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer. By rejecting, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to $15,000.
* **Rounds Remaining:** With 6 rounds left, I still have time to explore further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $13,500 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $14,250 as a final compromise.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm again rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to meet in the middle.
* **Finality:** I'm indicating that this is my ""final compromise"" to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that this price would be a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $14250. How about we try $11500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower than Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are down to 4 rounds left. Continuing negotiation is risky.
* **John's Offer:**  I can secure a guaranteed $12,000 from John, which is better than Bob's offer and matches my minimum. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer again, and I could end up with a lower price than John's offer. 

Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point in the negotiation."
