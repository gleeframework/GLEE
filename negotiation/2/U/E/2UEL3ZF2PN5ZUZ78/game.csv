"Bob, I understand your budgetary concerns, but my initial offer already reflects a price significantly lower than what I believe the product's true value is. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower the price to $1,375,000. This offer takes both of our positions into account.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a deal, but your current offer is still significantly below what I consider acceptable. To be transparent, I have another potential buyer who's offering closer to my asking price. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to consider $1,350,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable compromise on my part, and I need a decision soon.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
