"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, it's still more than you want to pay.  Since there are more rounds to negotiate, it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my range right now.  How about $95?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can you consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Alice is still above my target price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $115 is still a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'll meet you halfway again, so how about $110? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is getting closer to my target, I'm still willing to try for a lower price. I've got more rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about $108? It's just a small step down, but I think it's a fair price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $112, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth it for a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price. At this point, I'm willing to accept her offer of $112. It's still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate. There's also a chance that Alice will be unwilling to negotiate further, and I might end up buying from John for a higher price."
