"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit out of my range right now.  How about $95?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Can you consider that price?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $115 is still a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'll meet you halfway again, so how about $110? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.  How about $108? It's just a small step down, but I think it's a fair price we can both agree on.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $112, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think it's worth it for a product like this.",112.0,Alice,7,
