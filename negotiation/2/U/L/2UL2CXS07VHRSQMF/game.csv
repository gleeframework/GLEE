"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $12500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000.
