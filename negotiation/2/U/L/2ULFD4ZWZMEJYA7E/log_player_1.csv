Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your bottom line is key:** You need at least $150 for the product, but John offers you that as a safety net. This allows you to negotiate with Bob.
* **Starting high but reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($150) leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still ensuring a profit for you. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
