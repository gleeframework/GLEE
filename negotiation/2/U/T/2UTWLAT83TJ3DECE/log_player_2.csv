"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You have a better option to buy the product for $800,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you have a guaranteed alternative."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?

While $875,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit.  You have a guaranteed alternative with John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?

You've come pretty close to your target price with Alice, but she's not budging further. Since you have a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, it's time to go with the sure thing and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
