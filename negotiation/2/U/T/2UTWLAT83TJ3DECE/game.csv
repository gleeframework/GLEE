"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $825,000? That's a good middle ground that leaves room for both of us to benefit.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
