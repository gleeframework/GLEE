Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for Bob to feel good:** Offering $135 gives Bob the potential to negotiate you down slightly (if you're willing) and feel like they got a good deal, even if it's above their initial valuation.
* **Considering your alternative:** You know you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150. Therefore, you don't want to go below that price with Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
