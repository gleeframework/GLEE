Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as much from Bob as possible, knowing our safety net is John at $120.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below our guaranteed price and offers a seemingly small but attractive discount for Bob. 
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out."
