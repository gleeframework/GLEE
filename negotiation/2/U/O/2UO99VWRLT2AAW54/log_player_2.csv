"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than my maximum budget. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $800,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $650,000, given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I still believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial counteroffer, but I'm not going to accept anything close to her original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $680,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 680000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $680000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $700,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000 and I'm saving $500,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could try for a lower price, it's risky.  Alice might not budge further, and I could end up with nothing.  It's better to secure this deal now."
