"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $800000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $650000, given my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to offer $680000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's try to close this deal.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $680000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
