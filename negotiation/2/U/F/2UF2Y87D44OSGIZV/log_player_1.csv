Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it much higher at $1,500,000.  This presents a chance to make a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob saves $200,000 from his perceived value.
    * You earn $300,000 more than selling to John.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
