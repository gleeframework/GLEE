"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? It's a fair price considering its value on the current market.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
