"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is tempting, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $1,100,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $900,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
