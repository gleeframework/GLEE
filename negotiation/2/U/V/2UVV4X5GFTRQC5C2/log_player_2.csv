You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $105. This is a great deal for a product that's worth so much to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $105.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, it makes more sense to take that deal and save the extra $5."
