"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, even if the initial offer is at your maximum.  There's no guarantee Alice will budge, but rejecting the offer allows for a chance to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but also leaves room for further negotiation.  We'll see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still going to try to get a better price. There are still rounds left and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to meet Alice halfway on her last offer. This shows good faith while still trying to save some money.  If she's willing to negotiate further, we could potentially close the deal in the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to keep negotiating, we are at round 5 and we are getting closer to my target price. The risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a higher price is starting to feel more real. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product and save $25,000."
