"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make some progress towards my target. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I value your persistence and appreciate the offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
