Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target without risking selling to John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make some progress towards my target. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not where I want it to be. I'm willing to push for a slightly higher price, but with John waiting in the wings, I need to be careful not to lose too much time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your persistence and appreciate the offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
