"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($120). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still being profitable for me.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price from $110 to $100, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.  This keeps the negotiation moving forward while still ensuring I earn a profit.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints but emphasizing the fairness of the price.  The message remains positive and encouraging."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $92 is still below my $120 threshold. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob for a higher price before considering selling to John. There's still room to maneuver, and I don't want to give up on this deal just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $92 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $96? That way we both get a good deal and can move forward.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 96}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $96, which is halfway between my last offer ($100) and Bob's latest offer ($92).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm taking Bob's budget into consideration.
* **Message:** I'm remaining positive and emphasizing the mutually beneficial nature of the potential agreement. I'm hoping to convince Bob that $96 is a fair price for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $94. That way, I can still save a bit of money and we can both be happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $94 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price, but I'm also getting close to considering John's offer.  Selling to John would be a guaranteed $120, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $94 is still just a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm starting to think selling to John might be a better option at this point. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to continue working with you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $95, just $1 higher than Bob's last offer. This shows a slight concession while still keeping the price closer to my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm starting to subtly introduce the possibility of selling to John, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. I'm emphasizing this as my ""final compromise"" to push him towards agreement. 

This approach aims to:

* **Increase pressure:** The subtle threat of selling to John might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Keep negotiating:** It shows that I'm not giving up completely on the deal with Bob. 
* **Maximize profit:**  $95 is still a better price for me than Bob's offer and a decent amount of money, even though it's a bit lower than my initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'd be willing to meet you at $93. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire, and I'm starting to run out of time. While $93 is getting close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I've made multiple concessions and it seems like Bob is being stubborn. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement that meets my minimum price. 

Selling to John guarantees me $120, which is a much better outcome than settling for $93. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more profitable deal."
