Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 to match what John offers. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $100 gives Bob a good deal (saving him $20) while allowing you to earn a $20 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob (who values the product more) and maximizing your potential profit."
