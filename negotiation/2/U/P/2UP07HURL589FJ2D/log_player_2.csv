"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is well above his budget and he can get the product for less from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I understand that $1200000 is a stretch for you. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a significant profit while also considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $950,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $900000, which is a compromise between my original price and your budget. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for less from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further. There are still 5 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a very fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal right now. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm to close the deal, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise at $920000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $800,000. 

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still outside Bob's budget, and there are only a few rounds left. With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to a price that works for Bob.  It's better to secure the product from John at a price that's within his budget."
