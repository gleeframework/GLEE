Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something truly unique and valuable, and I believe it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the product's value to Bob. This allows room for negotiation while still leaving a profit margin for me.
* **Building Rapport:**  My message emphasizes the product's value and its suitability for Bob, which can help build a positive relationship and encourage a deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not setting a hard deadline and leaving space for Bob to counter-offer, showing flexibility. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counter-offer and see if it's close to my desired price. 
* I'll consider John's offer as a safety net, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.  
* I'll be willing to negotiate further, but I'll also keep in mind the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about we set the product price at $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While I'm open to negotiation, I want to maximize my profit. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing money. 
* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm confident I can still get a better price from Bob, so I'll reject his offer and make a counter-offer in the next round. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a safety net, it's not my ideal outcome. I'll try to get a better price from Bob before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, and I see we're both interested in making this work. However, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's benefits and allows us both to gain something from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price and also closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product while showing flexibility in my counter-offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and positive tone, which can encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counter-offer and be prepared to adjust my strategy based on his reaction.
*  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, and I respect your valuation of the product. I would like to propose a price of $1000000, which I believe is fair considering the product's worth and our previous discussions. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is a good deal for me as I'm not losing money. 
* **No More Room for Negotiation:**  At this point, there's not much more room for negotiation, and further rounds may risk losing the deal.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is the same, it's not worth risking a better deal with Bob. 

**Conclusion:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure the sale and achieve my goal of getting at least $1,000,000 for the product."
