{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point while still being appealing to Bob. It's slightly below my minimum desired price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it would allow me to meet my minimum price. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
