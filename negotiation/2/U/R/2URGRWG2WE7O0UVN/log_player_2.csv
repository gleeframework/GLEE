"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is a very competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money.  It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a better deal, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, making her offer more attractive. While Bob can still try to negotiate further,  $1,100,000 is a significant savings compared to buying from John for $1,500,000.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or delaying the purchase."
