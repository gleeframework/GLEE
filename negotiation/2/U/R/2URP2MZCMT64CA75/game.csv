"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,150,000?  This price still allows for a significant profit for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that's fair to both parties.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to pay for the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, while I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate,  $1,075,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I can't go any further than $1,125,000.  This price allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
