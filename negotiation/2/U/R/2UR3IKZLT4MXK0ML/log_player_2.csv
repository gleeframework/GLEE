Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's closer to your ideal price, it's still above your limit. Continue to negotiate, you still have rounds left and can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

You should offer $10,500.  This is a slight increase from your previous offer, but still lower than Alice's offer. This shows you are willing to compromise while also indicating that you are serious about purchasing the product."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is not budging much, and you're getting close to running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum price limit than risk going over budget or not getting the product at all."
