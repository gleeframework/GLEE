"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This is a starting point that's a bit aggressive but still leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm framing it as a mutually beneficial deal and leaving it open for discussion. This keeps the communication friendly and open. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if I can quickly get a deal close to my minimum. 
* I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but my goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* If the negotiations stall, I'm not afraid to walk away and sell to John, securing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is still higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to secure a deal, selling for $850,000 would be a substantial loss for me. I'm also not ready to give up on a higher price yet. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting:** By rejecting, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my expectations.
* **Counter-offer:**  I will use the next round to make a counter-offer that is closer to my minimum but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints. This keeps the negotiation open and avoids ending the deal prematurely.
* **Sell to John:**  I'm keeping this option open as a backup if the negotiations with Bob fail to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my value. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting that this offer is a compromise and beneficial for both parties.
* **$975,000:**  This is the midpoint between my initial offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). It's a fair compromise that gives us both room to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

* **Balance:** I'm attempting to find a balance between securing a reasonable price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Flexibility:** I'm showing I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still firm on getting a price closer to my minimum.
* **Open for Discussion:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation and a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would get us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I'm happy he's increasing his offer, it's not enough for me to close the deal yet. I'm determined to secure a higher price and believe further negotiation is possible.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm still aiming for a higher price. This keeps the negotiation going and prevents a quick settlement that would be unfavorable to me.
* **Counter-offer:** I will use the next round to make another counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, demonstrating flexibility but not compromising on my minimum.
* **Sell to John:**  I'm still keeping this option open as a backup if the negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This is a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. This demonstrates flexibility without significantly compromising my position.
* **Message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, suggesting that $950,000 is a good compromise and the price is getting closer to a deal. 
* **$950,000:** This is a halfway point between my previous offer of $975,000 and Bob's current offer of $900,000. It represents a continued effort to find a mutually acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to go lower than $950,000 as this is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a compromise that gets us closer to a deal. This puts pressure on Bob to either accept or make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Keep Negotiations Open:** I'm keeping the communication open for further negotiation,  hoping to get a deal that is closer to my minimum value."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm still not able to go above $925000. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident we can find a compromise at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not willing to settle for a deal that significantly undervalues my product.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting:** This signals to Bob that I'm not desperate to close the deal and I'm still aiming for a higher price.  It keeps the negotiation alive.
* **Counter-offer:** I'll use the next round to make a counter-offer that is closer to my desired price,  showing that I'm willing to negotiate further but not at the expense of my minimum value.
* **Sell to John:** I'm still keeping the option to sell to John open in case the negotiations with Bob fail to reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $940,000, which is a small compromise from my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. This shows flexibility while remaining close to my desired price.
* **Message:** I'm highlighting that this is a significant compromise on my part and emphasizes the progress made in the negotiations. This encourages Bob to make a final push to reach a deal. 
* **$940,000:** This is a good compromise, acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still ensuring a reasonable price for me. 

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:** This offer is a final push to reach a deal. I'm aiming for a quick resolution while maintaining a fair price for myself.
* **Positive Tone:** The positive tone and focus on compromise aim to encourage Bob to accept or make a final counteroffer.
* **Selling to John:** I'm still prepared to sell to John if negotiations fail, but I'm hoping this offer is enough to seal the deal with Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close! I'm willing to go up to $935000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $935,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $940,000. It is a significant increase from his previous offer, demonstrating his genuine interest in closing the deal. 

**Strategy:**

* **Closing the Deal:**  Given the limited time remaining (only two rounds left), it's best to accept this offer and avoid potentially losing the deal altogether.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a higher price is always preferable, the risk of further negotiation resulting in a lower offer or a complete breakdown in negotiations is too high. 
* **Minimal Loss:** Accepting this offer results in a slight loss compared to my ideal price, but it's still significantly better than selling to John for my minimum value.

I am confident that this is a strategic decision that maximizes my chances of achieving a successful outcome in this negotiation."
