"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price, given the product's value and our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Alice,5,
