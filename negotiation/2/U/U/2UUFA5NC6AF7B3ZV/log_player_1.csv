Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation but aims for a higher profit.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While high, the $115 offer isn't outrageous considering Bob's valuation. It suggests I'm open to a deal but not desperate.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to buy. If he accepts immediately, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he negotiates, I can adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is tempting, I believe I can do better.  Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's definitely interested. Rejecting his first counter is standard negotiation practice and doesn't necessarily scare him off. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed $100 from John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob immediately. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price for a product you'll find valuable."",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above $105.  Splitting the difference suggests a willingness to make a deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him why he's interested.
* **Observation:**  Bob's response to this counteroffer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll assess whether to push further or take John's offer."
