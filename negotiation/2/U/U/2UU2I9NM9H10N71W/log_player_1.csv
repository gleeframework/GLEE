Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming to me first. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $750,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
