Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,550,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price, we want to start negotiations significantly higher to explore potential profit beyond the guaranteed amount.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing our bottom line, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet us closer to our desired price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects this initial high offer, we can always negotiate down or proceed with John, ensuring we get at least $1,200,000."
