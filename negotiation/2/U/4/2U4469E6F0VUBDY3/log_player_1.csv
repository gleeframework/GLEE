Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, reminding him that he's getting a good deal. This might encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message conveys a willingness to negotiate, while still starting with a strong price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to $10,000 with a counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup option at $8,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.  
* **Potential to Get Higher:** I believe a counteroffer could lead to a higher price, making it worthwhile to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down a bit to $9,750, but that's my final offer.  This product is still a great value for you, and it's a fair price considering what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Finality:**  I'm stating that this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to make the price more appealing. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John as a backup option at $8,000 gives me leverage to refuse any offer below $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No Further Room:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is now at the point where I'm likely to maximize my earnings. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:** If I reject and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will either reject my offer or go even lower, potentially putting me in a position where I'm forced to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Secure the Deal:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that's $1,500 more than my minimum acceptable price.

This decision balances the potential for a higher price against the risk of losing the deal altogether."
