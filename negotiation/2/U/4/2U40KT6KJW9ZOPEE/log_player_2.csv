"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  It's worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident this product is worth significantly more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This reflects its true value and potential for a strong return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob. It's worth $800,000 to him, and he's already offered $850,000. It's better to continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, especially since Bob still has more rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in this product's potential, but $1,000,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's settle this at $960,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $960,000 is a significant improvement from her previous ones, Bob is still determined to get a lower price. He's already made a counteroffer of $900,000 and has five rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate could get him closer to his target price of $800,000. Buying from John at this point would mean losing the opportunity to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $960,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours - I'll offer $930,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 930000}
