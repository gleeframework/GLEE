It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** We're likely to see smaller and smaller concessions from Bob as the negotiation progresses. Holding out for another $20,000-$40,000 isn't worth the risk of him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  The longer this drags on, the more opportunity cost we incur. We could be using that time to pursue other deals or invest the money from the sale.
* **$280,000 Profit:**  Let's not lose sight of the fact that we're still making a significant profit selling to Bob at $1,280,000. 

While we could technically hold out for a higher price, the potential gains are outweighed by the risks at this point.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good deal and a clean conclusion to the negotiation."
