Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's perceived value.  

**Strategy**

Since Bob values the product at less than your minimum, a successful negotiation is unlikely unless you can convince him of a higher value. However, you have a strong fallback option (John). Therefore, you should aim high, leaving little room for negotiation.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm confident it's a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Price:** This price is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. It gives you room to negotiate down if needed, but more likely, it will lead to a quick rejection.
* **Confident Tone:** You present the offer as a valuable opportunity, implying the price is justified.

**Outcome**

* **Bob Accepts:** Highly unlikely given the price is far above his perceived value.
* **Bob Rejects:** The most probable outcome. You can then sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you prioritize the guaranteed sale to John over the unlikely chance of a much higher profit from Bob."
