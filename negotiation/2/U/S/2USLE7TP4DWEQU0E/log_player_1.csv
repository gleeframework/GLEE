"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer in terms of the value to Bob to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm aiming to get the best price, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000. This gives me a safety net and limits my risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a better price. I have 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to explore options. 
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer is attractive, I'm not yet ready to settle for $12,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but not by much. I'm emphasizing flexibility to show that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Mid-Point:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to my desired value, but still gives Bob some room for negotiation.
* **Motivation:** I'm highlighting the importance of reaching an agreement to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Note:** I'm still aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $9,000. This would be a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal target.
* **Negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not yet ready to accept John's offer.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:** I'll continue to counteroffer Bob in hopes of closing the deal at a price closer to $10,000.  I'm aware that time is a factor, and I may need to consider John's offer if I can't get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair outcome and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer but not fully accepting it.
* **Fair Outcome:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair outcome for both parties, emphasizing the mutual benefit.
* **Close the Deal:** I'm reiterating my desire to close the deal to incentivize Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

I'm moving incrementally closer to Bob's desired price while still staying above my minimum.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows a willingness to compromise without giving away too much. With 5 rounds left, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,100. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize this now.   
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for anything below $9,250.
* **Negotiation:** I have 4 rounds remaining, and I believe I can still push for a better price.
* **John's Offer:** I'm not yet ready to accept John's offer. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:** I will continue to counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his current offer, aiming for a compromise closer to my target price of $9,250. I'm aware that time is a factor, but I'm willing to take the risk of losing this deal if it means getting a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. Let's go with $9,150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm slowly narrowing the price gap, hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us.  I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm still hoping to get a higher price than $9,100.  If this counteroffer is rejected, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer in the next round."
