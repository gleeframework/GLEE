Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $9,000. This would be a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair outcome and allow us to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

Round 6

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. Let's go with $9,150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've gotten close to your target price, but you're running out of rounds. It's likely you won't be able to get Alice down to your desired $8,000, and you're at risk of not getting a deal at all.  It's better to secure the product from John at your desired price point."
