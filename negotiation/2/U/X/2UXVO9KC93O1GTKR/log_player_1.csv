Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While I'd like to earn as much as possible, selling to John for $1,500,000 is the safest option. However, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this work. This is still a great price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,325,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to my desired price of $1,400,000, and considering the limited number of rounds and the alternative of selling to John, it's a good deal. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiations leading to a lower price."
