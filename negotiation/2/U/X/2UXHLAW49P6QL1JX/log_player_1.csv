"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $20,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I think you'll find it quite valuable as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to both of us to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Openness:**  I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, starting a dialogue rather than being inflexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $16000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer, $16,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds and haven't used all of them.  I believe I can still push for a better price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate. John's offer ensures I won't be stuck with a price below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $16,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which reflects the value of this product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:**  I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, I'm countering with a specific price and explaining why it's a fair compromise. 
* **Moving Towards a Middle Ground:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $18000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $14000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $14,000 is still under my minimum of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:**  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, there's no reason to accept Bob's offer, which is lower.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** We are only in round 4, so I have 6 more rounds to try and negotiate a price closer to my minimum.

While Bob is making a ""serious commitment,"" I'm not obligated to accept an offer that doesn't meet my minimum.  I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $14,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement, but still maintains a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value and compromise:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that I'm making a considerable concession.
* **Positive language:** I'm maintaining a friendly and professional tone to encourage a successful negotiation. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to reconsider his stance and move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'd like to propose a price of $15000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it if we can agree on that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** This is the first time Bob's offer has reached my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Limited time remaining:** We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds for further negotiations. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Although I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'm aware that I could still sell to John for the same price if the negotiation doesn't lead to a better outcome.

While I'd ideally like to get a higher price, there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer in the next few rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me my minimum and avoids the risk of losing a sale altogether."
