"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me in the middle at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $16000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18000, which reflects the value of this product and gives us both a fair deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $18000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a price of $14000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it if we can agree on that price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but $14000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'd like to propose a price of $15000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy it if we can agree on that price.",15000.0,Bob,6,
