"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
