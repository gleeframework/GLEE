{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being attractive to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is interesting, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1,050,000, I still think I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to sell to John for less than my minimum.  I'll try to find a middle ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable figure for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I have several rounds left, and I'm not going to give up easily."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate that. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
