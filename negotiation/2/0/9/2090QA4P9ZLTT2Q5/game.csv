"Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is interesting, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable figure for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate that. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
