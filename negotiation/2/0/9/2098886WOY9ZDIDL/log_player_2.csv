"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $15,000 at a discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, there's room for negotiation. You know the product is worth less to Alice ($12,000) and you have a maximum budget of $15,000. By rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer, you can try to secure a better deal without risking losing the product entirely (you can always go with John's offer of $15,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price of $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to your target price. While it's a significant drop from Alice's offer, it leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message maintains a positive tone, expressing continued interest in the product despite the counteroffer. This helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $12,500, you're aiming for a price point where you save a good amount while still offering Alice a profit margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at a price of $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but there's still room for improvement. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away if necessary, which might push Alice to make a more appealing offer in the next round. You're still below your maximum budget and have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?"",
""product_price"": 12750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a good deal. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By suggesting a specific price point, you encourage Alice to continue the negotiation rather than potentially stalling.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $12,750 represents a reasonable middle ground between your last offer and Alice's current offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
