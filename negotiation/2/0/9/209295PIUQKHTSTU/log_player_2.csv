"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, it's not the best possible price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible while still staying within his budget of $120. Offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still a decent profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $107.50 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer, indicating a potential win-win scenario. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product for a price within his budget and saves him $2.50 compared to buying from John. It also avoids further negotiation and potentially wasting time and energy."
