"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the product for a much lower price from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob should start by offering the absolute minimum he's willing to pay, which is $8,000. This is the price he can get from John, so it's a good starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  It's better to keep negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should increase his offer to $9,000. This shows Alice that he is willing to negotiate, but also that he is still serious about getting a good deal.  $9,000 is a fair middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $9,500 is still within his budget and a good deal considering the negotiations. It's also close to his previous counteroffer, indicating a possible compromise. While he could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't budge further, and he risks losing the deal to another buyer."
