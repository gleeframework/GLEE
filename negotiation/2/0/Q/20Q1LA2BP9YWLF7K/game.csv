"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? It's a fair price that balances our interests and gets you a great deal on this unique product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could we possibly settle at $7,000? That would be a price I'm comfortable with.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the minimum I can accept. It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",8000.0,Alice,5,
