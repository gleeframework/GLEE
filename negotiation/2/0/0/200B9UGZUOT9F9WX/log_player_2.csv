"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He's offering $11,000, which is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and likely a fair price considering Alice's minimum value of $10,000. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also firm on his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money and $12,000 is still a bit higher than he'd like to go.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially push the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a compromise.  He's increased his offer slightly from $11,000 to $11,500, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. This price is halfway between Alice's offer and his previous counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise that could potentially lead to a deal."
