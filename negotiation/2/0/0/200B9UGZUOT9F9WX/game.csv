"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would be a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",11500.0,Bob,4,
