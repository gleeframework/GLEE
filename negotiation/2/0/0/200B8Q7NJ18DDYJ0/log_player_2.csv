"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below the product's value to Bob, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option."
