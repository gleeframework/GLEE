You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  While Alice is offering a good deal, it's still worth trying to save more."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You're close to a good deal, and there's still room for compromise. You've already shown a willingness to pay close to Alice's asking price, so a counteroffer might be enough to get her to accept a price closer to your target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you to accept."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $990,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You've already come down to $975,000, and Alice has come down to $990,000. This is a good deal for you, saving you $210,000 compared to buying from John. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely."
