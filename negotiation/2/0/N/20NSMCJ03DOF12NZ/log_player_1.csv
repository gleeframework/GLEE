"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Since Bob's offer of $90 is lower than my minimum price of $100, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer the product to Bob for $110.
