"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for this product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value we both see in this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain from this purchase.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for a product with a real value of $1,000,000 to you. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
