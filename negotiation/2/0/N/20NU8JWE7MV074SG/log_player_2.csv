Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain from this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for a product with a real value of $1,000,000 to you. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
