Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, falling far below my minimum acceptable price. I need to push for a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit away from that number. Would you consider $9,750? I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit below what I'm willing to accept. Let's split the difference.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,937.50 is still a little low for me. However, I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $10,000 for the product.
