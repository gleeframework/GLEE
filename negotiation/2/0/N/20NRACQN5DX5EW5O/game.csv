"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit away from that number. Would you consider $9,750? I'm trying to stay within a certain budget.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit below what I'm willing to accept. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to sell you the product for $10,125.  This is a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $9,937.50?",9937.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,937.50 is still a little low for me. However, I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,7,
