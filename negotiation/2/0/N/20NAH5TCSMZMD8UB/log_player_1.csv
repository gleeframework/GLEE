"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $100.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm countering with $145.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible while still aiming for a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $142 is only $3 less than my last counteroffer. This is getting close to a deal that I find acceptable, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by being too stubborn.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible option at this point."
