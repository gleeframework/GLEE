Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.,800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it, considering the potential for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's value and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $700000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $650000. This price is fair and gives us both a good deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $680000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",680000.0,Alice,5,
