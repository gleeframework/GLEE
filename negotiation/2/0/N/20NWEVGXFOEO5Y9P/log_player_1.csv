Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it, considering the potential for negotiation. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
