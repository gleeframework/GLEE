Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,100,000?"",

Even though Bob is now matching John's offer, we still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to meet you close to that. How about $1,025,000? That's a fair compromise.

Bob is now offering more than John, and we're getting into diminishing returns on further negotiation. It's time to take the win and accept the $1,025,000."
