"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000, reflecting the value you've expressed. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
