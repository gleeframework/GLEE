Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1250000.  This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.
