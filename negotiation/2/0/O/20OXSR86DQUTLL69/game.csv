"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to consider a purchase, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1250000.  This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1100000 still doesn't fully reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1150000. This is a compromise that gives you a good deal while ensuring I can move forward. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
