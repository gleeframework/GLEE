Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know this is a significant investment, but it's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile purchase. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 but still leaves a substantial profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product for Bob. It also acknowledges the significant investment but emphasizes the opportunity. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price than my minimum, I'm creating a sense of urgency and making the deal more appealing to Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can then use John's offer of $1,500,000 as leverage to potentially get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to consider a purchase, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer to him. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a higher price. I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if I'm unable to reach a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,250,000.  This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I've lowered my price to $1,250,000. This is still above Bob's offer but represents a compromise.
* **Message:**  The message is firm but still respectful. I acknowledge Bob's position while emphasizing the product's value. I'm also framing the offer as a fair deal for both parties, promoting a collaborative tone. 

**Strategy:** 

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still ensuring a reasonable profit. This strategy aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer and avoid the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up from his previous offer, $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss for me.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.  I can use John's offer as leverage to try and get closer to my target price."

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, but it still allows me to make a profit. I'm showing flexibility while demonstrating my commitment to making a deal.
