{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum value but allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal without having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, considering my minimum value and the potential risk of a counter-offer or selling to John for a lower price."
