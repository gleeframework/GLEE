"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. I've assessed its worth to be around $1 million, and I'm confident it can bring significant benefit to your operations. I'm willing to offer it to you at a discounted price of $900,000, which is still a substantial gain for both of us. Let me know your thoughts on this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $900,000, while John wants $1,000,000.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even at $900,000, you're saving $100,000 compared to John's price. 
* **It's within your budget:** The product is worth no more than $1,000,000 to you, and Alice's offer is well below that."
