Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point:** It's a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation and leaves room for potential compromise.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the potential value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum ($15,000) while still being reasonable to Bob. 
* I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial price, but I'll also be ready to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to offer you $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price closer to my minimum. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my target price, potentially around $11,500, bridging the gap.
* **Show Flexibility:** Rejecting his initial counteroffer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a sale and am willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Evaluate Selling to John:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This is still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good price for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still friendly and encourages continued negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Progress Towards My Minimum:**  $11,500 is closer to my target price of $15,000, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Balancing Flexibility and Firmness:**  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while also showing that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Prepare for the Next Step:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's next move, and be ready to either accept his offer (if it's close enough to $11,500) or continue to counteroffer if necessary.  I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind if negotiations reach a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,500. How about we try $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is still below my preferred price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $15,000.  Given that Bob is willing to pay a price above his own perceived value, continuing to negotiate might just lead to a stalemate. 

**Strategy:**

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Further negotiation could mean losing valuable time and potentially losing Bob's interest altogether.  
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** Accepting $11,000 is a compromise, but it secures a sale with minimal risk.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price or no sale at all. 
* **Potential Future Deals:** While $11,000 is below my minimum for this specific product, building a good relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities where I might be able to negotiate a more favorable price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a reasonable price, leaving room for future potential."
