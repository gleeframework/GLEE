I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it. I believe I can get closer to $10,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."

While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000, I'm starting to run out of time.  It's a good deal considering that Bob is only willing to pay $8,000.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $9,300."
