"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I start with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $130, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has indicated she's willing to negotiate by coming down in price.
* $120 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her last offer and my previous counteroffer.
* This price gives me a good deal while still likely being profitable for Alice."
