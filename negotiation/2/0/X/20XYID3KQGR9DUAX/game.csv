"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $11000 to make this work.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $9500?  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and my limited budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle ground.  How about $10500?  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being within your budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  $10500 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $9750.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $10250. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement in the next few rounds.",10250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there! I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute limit. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's finalize this deal and make it work for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $10000 is still a little below what I need.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $10125.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I believe it's within your budget. Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,9,
