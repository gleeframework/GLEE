"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and unique features, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance to me, reflecting its true worth at $10,000. Considering its immense value to both parties involved, I am extending this offer to you at a special price of $9,500. This represents a remarkable opportunity for you to secure a high-quality asset at a slightly discounted rate, which I believe is a fair compromise given the product's intrinsic value. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. I look forward to the possibility of working with you.
