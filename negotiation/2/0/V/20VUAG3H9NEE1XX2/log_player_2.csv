"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth significantly more to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,000,000.  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counter-offer process and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
