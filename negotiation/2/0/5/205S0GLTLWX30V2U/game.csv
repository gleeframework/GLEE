"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50?",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can do $82.50, but I was thinking maybe we could meet at $83. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit",83.0,Alice,5,
