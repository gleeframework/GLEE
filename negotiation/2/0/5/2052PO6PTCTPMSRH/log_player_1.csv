"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. It's higher than my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit. I'm optimistic that Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $100 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for something closer to $115. It's a fair price considering the value to you. Let's find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might be more appealing to Bob than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his $100 offer, and I'm running out of time.  I'm not comfortable accepting such a low price, and I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer. It's time to take the guaranteed $100 from John."
