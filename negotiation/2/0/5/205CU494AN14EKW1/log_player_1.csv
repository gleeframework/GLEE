Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.  
* **Negotiation Space:**  Ideally, you want to sell it for more than Bob values it, but less than your guaranteed amount.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Why This Offer?**

* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,250,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's valuation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" creates perceived value, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow more room for concessions.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be strategic. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response!"
