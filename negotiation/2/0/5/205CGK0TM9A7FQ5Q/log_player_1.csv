Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but still offer an attractive price to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering it for much less, like $12,000 or slightly above, drastically reduces potential profit even if Bob accepts.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000."
