Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $110 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. How about $120? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $120, $115 is still a decent profit and better than selling to John. There's a chance I could get a better price later, but with the limited rounds, it's a safer bet to accept the offer now."
