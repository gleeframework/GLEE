Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,500,000?**  I'm aiming for a significant profit, but also keeping the offer appealing enough that Bob might be willing to pay it. If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so this offer leaves room for a potential gain.
* **The Importance of Not Knowing Bob's Value:**  Since I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob, I need to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of him rejecting the offer. A higher price risks rejection but offers a bigger potential payout. 

**Strategy:** This is a risky but potentially rewarding strategy. The key is to assess Bob's potential interest in the product based on any information available to me before making the offer."
