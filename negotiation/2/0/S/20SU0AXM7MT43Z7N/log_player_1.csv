Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I explore other offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,300,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other offers,"" we create a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
