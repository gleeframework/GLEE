Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while working for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
