"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while working for my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $900,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite enough to cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, while still ensuring I receive a fair return for the product's quality and potential. Let's see if we can bridge the gap with this offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
