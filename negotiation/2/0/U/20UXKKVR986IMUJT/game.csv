"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product.  While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to secure it for a bit less to ensure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Considering that, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm bringing to the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,350,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to save a bit more, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer it to you for $1,325,000 + $12,500, which is $1,337,500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
