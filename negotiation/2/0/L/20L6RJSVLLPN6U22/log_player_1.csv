Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to your company. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is above my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000 and is getting closer to my ideal price.  It's also a fair compromise that allows us to close the deal. I'm happy to accept this offer."
