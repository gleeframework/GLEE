"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but above her valuation, I'm aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a great deal. 
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone is crucial for a successful negotiation. I want to show Alice that I'm interested but also firm in my budget.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $110 leaves room for further negotiation while keeping me well below my maximum budget. This allows me to counter any potential counteroffers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. However, the product is worth quite a bit to me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met us exactly in the middle of our previous offers. This is a common negotiation tactic and a good sign that she's willing to compromise. While I could try to negotiate further,  $125 is a reasonable price that saves me $25 off John's price and is still a good deal for Alice. It's better to accept a fair offer now than risk pushing too hard and potentially losing the deal altogether."
