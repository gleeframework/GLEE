Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she'll hold firm and we'll end up with John's offer of $1,000,000 anyway. Accepting $925,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
