Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

We're still significantly below what John is offering, and Bob is showing willingness to move.  Let's keep negotiating."

Bob is incrementing his offers too slowly. It's unlikely we'll reach a significantly better deal within the remaining rounds, and risking a lower final offer isn't worth it. John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price."
