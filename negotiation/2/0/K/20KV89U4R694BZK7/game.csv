"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal!",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $105 is still a bit too high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $102.50. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us!",102.5,Alice,5,
