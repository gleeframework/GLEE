Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. It's a win-win situation!  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
