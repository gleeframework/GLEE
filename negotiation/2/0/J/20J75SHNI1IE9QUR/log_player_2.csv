"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price that reflects its true potential. I'm confident you'll recognize its value, and I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial price. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your Value:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the potential savings are unlikely to exceed the $200,000 you'd gain by accepting her current offer."
