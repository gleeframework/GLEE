"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's something you'll definitely find valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a clear target of $1,200,000 and can use the option of buying from John as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,350,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
