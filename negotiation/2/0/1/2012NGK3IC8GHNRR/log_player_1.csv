"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* Offering $1,750,000 in the first round is a strong opening that demonstrates my confidence in the product's value.
* I'm aiming for a win-win scenario, where I get a good price and Bob gets a product he values at $1,000,000 for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* I am confident that I can negotiate a better price, as Bob has already shown interest by making a counteroffer.
* I have 8 more rounds to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity for a potentially better deal with Bob."

```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, demonstrating flexibility. 
* This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

**Explanation:**

*  I'm lowering the price further, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I am serious about selling to Bob, but also that I am not willing to give up my desired margin.
* I'm making a significant concession from my last offer, but also leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.
*  This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It could convince Bob to accept, or he might reject it again.  However, with 5 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take that risk to hopefully secure a deal that's close to my minimum acceptable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering the price significantly from the previous round. With only 3 rounds left, I need to be more aggressive.
* While this offer is still above my minimum, it's getting closer to Bob's offers. 
* This counteroffer is a gamble. It's possible Bob might reject it, forcing me to make a final decision in the next round.
* The goal is to push Bob towards accepting a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

*  With only 2 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming increasingly risky. 
* Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* There's a high chance that we won't be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds.
* Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of ending up with a deal significantly below my target. 

It's a tough decision, but with the limited time remaining and the potential for a low price, selling to John is the most secure option at this point."
