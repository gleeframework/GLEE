"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'd go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
