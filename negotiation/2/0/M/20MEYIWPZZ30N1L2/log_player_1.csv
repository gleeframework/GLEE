Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better outcome.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, but that doesn't reflect its potential worth to him in the future.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the offer's limited nature and Bob's preferential treatment can encourage a quicker decision.

This approach aims for a win-win scenario: Bob might see the potential for significant ROI at the offered price, and you stand to gain a higher profit than your backup plan."
