"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $9,250?  This would give you a great deal on the product while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
