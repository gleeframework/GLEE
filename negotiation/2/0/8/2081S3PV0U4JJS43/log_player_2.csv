"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum price point of $12,000.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can counteroffer and try to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiations fail, you can still secure the product for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** I've offered a price that's closer to Alice's value of $8,000, but still gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** My message emphasizes my interest in the product but highlights the need for a lower price. 
* **Setting the stage for further negotiation:** This counteroffer establishes a starting point for a potential back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $9,250?  This would give you a great deal on the product while ensuring I get a fair price.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to my preferred price, it's still above my budget. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I believe I can push for a lower price, potentially closer to my initial counteroffer of $8,500.
* **Buying from John is a safety net.** If negotiations break down, I can still purchase the product from John, even if it's at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant counteroffer:** I've increased my offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying within my budget.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I've highlighted the ""good deal"" aspect for both parties, trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness. 
* **Close the deal call to action:**  I've used language that indicates I'm ready to finalize the deal if Alice is willing to accept."
