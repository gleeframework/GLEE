Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $120 to me.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to accept this price. If not, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum, and it's also a compromise from my original offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still too low for me.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
