"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfortable range. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This would give you a healthy profit and keep me within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum sale price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
