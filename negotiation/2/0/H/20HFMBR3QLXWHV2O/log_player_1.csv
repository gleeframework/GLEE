"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's equal to your minimum acceptable price. You have another buyer (John) willing to pay the full $1,200,000. 

At this point, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a higher price. He's already signaled his initial valuation, and continuing might be a waste of time and could potentially lead to a worse outcome.  

Therefore, it's strategically sound to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
