"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  It's above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product but I can only offer $7,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

Bob is starting with a lower counter-offer,  trying to establish a starting point for negotiations.  He's keeping in mind his budget and trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While it's getting closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is increasing his offer to $8,000,  showing his commitment to the deal while staying within his budget. He's aiming for a compromise and a fair price for both parties."
