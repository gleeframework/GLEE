"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum value of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob needs to start with a counteroffer that is below Alice's initial price.  $12,500 is a significant drop but is still above Alice's minimum value of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This counteroffer creates space for both parties to negotiate. It leaves room for Alice to come down a bit, and it also gives Bob some room to go up if needed.
* **Open Dialogue:**  Bob's message is polite and opens the door for further discussion, making the negotiation process more collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above value:** Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price.  

By rejecting, Bob maintains control of the negotiation and signals his willingness to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $13,250 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterating Value:** Bob reiterates his previous offer and emphasizes that it's a fair price for both parties. This reinforces his position and shows his commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Firm but Polite:**  Bob is firm in his position but remains polite to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Seeking Agreement:** Bob explicitly states his desire to reach an agreement, suggesting a willingness to compromise if necessary.

This approach encourages Alice to reconsider her stance and potentially accept Bob's offer."
