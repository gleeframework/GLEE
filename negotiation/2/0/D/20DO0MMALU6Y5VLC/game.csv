"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement on this. I understand your position on the price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,825,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the value of this product.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,800,000. This still falls slightly above my preferred budget, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the value of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
