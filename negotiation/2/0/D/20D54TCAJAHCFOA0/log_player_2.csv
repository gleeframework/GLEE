"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you can potentially get a better price. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or you can buy from John for $1,200,000."
