Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher than that to me.  I could consider letting it go for $1,000,000.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach a price point that makes staying in negotiations worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a significant profit above Bob's current offer and my minimum."
