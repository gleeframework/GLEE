"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  I'm proposing $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,3,
