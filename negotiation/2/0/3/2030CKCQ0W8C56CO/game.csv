"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the benefit you'll gain.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I agree it's a valuable product, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we possibly settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Let's make this our final offer - $10,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
