Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the benefit you'll gain.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be realistic about the product's worth.  Let's make this our final offer - $10,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you.

While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" is still above your maximum price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000."
