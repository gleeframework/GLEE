"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $8,000. Let's find a way to make this work!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference at $9,625?  This would be a good middle ground for both of us, and it's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you. Let's finalize this deal!",9625.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,500. How about we try to get a bit closer to my target price? I'd be willing to meet you at $9,300. It's still a compromise, but I think it's worth it for me to get the product.",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,300, but we're still a bit apart.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $9,450.  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9450.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. How about we meet at $9,100? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's worth it to get the product.",9100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $9,100, but we're still quite far apart.  Since time is running out, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm offering the product for $9,800. This is my absolute lowest price, considering the value of the product.  If you're truly interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.  Let me know your decision.",9800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,500. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to stretch any further. I'm going to have to pass on this deal.",8500.0,Bob,10,
