"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on something closer to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
