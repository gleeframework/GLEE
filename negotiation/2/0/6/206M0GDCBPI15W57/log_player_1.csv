Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves room for negotiation if he counters. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is significantly above Alice's $10,000 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy for $10,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob."
