"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to the right buyer is significant. I could consider letting it go for $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to unlock its potential for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,025,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I believe it's a fair price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
