"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product is interesting, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $750,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $625,000?",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $625,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  To show you I'm serious, I'm willing to go up to $650,000. Let's make this deal happen!",650000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",675000.0,Alice,7,
