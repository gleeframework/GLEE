This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm willing to take a chance on getting a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept for this product. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If you're not interested in this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm concerned that he might not be willing to go any higher.  John is a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000, which is a more secure and acceptable outcome for me at this point."
