"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. While I understand its worth to you, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. My counteroffer for the product is $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to gain a reasonable return while recognizing the value this product brings to your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
