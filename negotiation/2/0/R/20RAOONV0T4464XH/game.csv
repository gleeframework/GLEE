"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I believe $14,000 is a bit steep for this particular product. I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This feels like a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"You're a tough negotiator, Bob, I appreciate that!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $12,000. How about $12,250?",12250.0,Alice,5,
