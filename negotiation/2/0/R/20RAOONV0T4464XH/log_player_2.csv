"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate a better price, considering the product's value to me and the potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, I believe $14,000 is a bit steep for this particular product. I'm willing to offer $10,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $10,000, I'm aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This creates room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a very favorable deal.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful while clearly stating that I find the initial offer too high. It expresses my interest in the product but emphasizes the need for a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is quite below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This feels like a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice meeting halfway is a good sign, but $12,500 is still closer to her desired price than mine. There's room for further negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Again):** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($12,500) and my previous offer ($10,000). It shows a willingness to compromise but also maintains pressure for a lower price.
* **Simple and Direct:** The message keeps the tone positive and solution-oriented. By suggesting a specific price and framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" I'm hoping to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're a tough negotiator, Bob, I appreciate that!  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $12,000. How about $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice is signaling she won't go much lower than $12,000.  $12,250 is a reasonable compromise, saving me $2,750 compared to John's offer.
* **Time Factor:** We're past the halfway point of negotiations. Continuing to push for a slightly better price might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
