"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $120. I understand that it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $155, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $147, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know if that works for you.",147.0,Alice,5,
