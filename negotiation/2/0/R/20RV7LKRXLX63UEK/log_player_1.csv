"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $20,000 to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to potentially make concessions if needed, while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at that price, and I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $17,000, which is still above my minimum value but shows flexibility.  This allows for further negotiation while still maintaining a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 matches my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer secures my minimum profit and allows me to move on."
