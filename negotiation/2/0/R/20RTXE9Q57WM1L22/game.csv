"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Consider this a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your decision.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
