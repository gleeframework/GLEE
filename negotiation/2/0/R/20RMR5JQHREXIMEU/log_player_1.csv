Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The $1,500,000 offer leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, you aim to justify the higher price tag. 

This strategy balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, you secure a substantial profit. If he rejects it, you still have your fallback option with John."
