"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price given the product's value and my budget limitations. Let's try to finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $862,500. This is as low as I can go without sacrificing my own profit margin. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $862,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $855,000 for the product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's try to reach an agreement.",855000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you at $855,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $862,500 and $855,000, which is $858,750. This is my final offer. What do you think?",858750.0,Alice,7,
