"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a lower price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good price. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and shows a willingness to negotiate, while also making a strong first move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. While Bob could potentially get a lower price with another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will reject it.  Accepting this offer secures a deal that's within Bob's budget and saves him $50,000 compared to buying from John."
