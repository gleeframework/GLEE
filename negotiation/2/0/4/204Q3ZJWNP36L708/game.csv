"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering your value. It's a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,500. This is still a great deal for me, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
