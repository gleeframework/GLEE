Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000, which is closer to my minimum. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be increasing her offer price instead of negotiating down.  It's clear she's not going to sell for less than $12,000, and her offers are getting further away from your budget. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $10,000, ensuring you stay within your limit."
