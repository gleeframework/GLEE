"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I understand you have a budget, but consider this: this product is worth a lot more to you than that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $750,000 is still far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This is my final offer.  What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
