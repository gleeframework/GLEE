Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value you place on it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It's also a fair price for Bob considering his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
