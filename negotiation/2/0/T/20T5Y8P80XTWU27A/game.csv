"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $108? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $108 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. Let's meet at $112.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $112. How about we try $109? It's a small step up from my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",109.0,Bob,6,
