Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to the product's value to me ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a price close to $150, starting with a slightly lower offer ($149) might make Bob more receptive. There's a chance he'll accept outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $150.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
