"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $700,000.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal. ",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $715,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",715000.0,Alice,5,
