Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** We know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum allows room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it at your minimum price."
