Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It allows room for negotiation and potentially a good profit for you.  It's also a high enough price to gauge Bob's interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,000,000 is your minimum acceptable price,  I believe there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It's still a significant profit for me, but it might be more appealing to Bob than the original $1,500,000 price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me a secure $1,000,000."
