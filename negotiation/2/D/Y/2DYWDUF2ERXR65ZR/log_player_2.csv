"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$110 is too high for Bob, he wants to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $110 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $95. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save money. $105 is still a bit too high, so rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit further.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $102.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is getting closer to his target price. While $102.5 is still a bit higher than what he'd like to pay, it's a decent deal. Rejecting this offer could risk going back and forth for more rounds and potentially ending up with a higher price, or having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the most strategic move at this point."
