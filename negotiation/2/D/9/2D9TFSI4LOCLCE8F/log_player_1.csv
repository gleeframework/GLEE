Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $120,  starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) gives you room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $145 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  increasing your potential profit. If Bob is eager, he might accept the initial offer.
* **Considering the alternative:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150. Therefore, there's no incentive to go below that price with Bob."
