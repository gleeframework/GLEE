I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly, and it's not worth the risk of her raising the price again in future rounds. John's offer is a guaranteed saving."
