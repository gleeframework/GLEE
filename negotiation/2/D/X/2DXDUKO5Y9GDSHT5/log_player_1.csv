Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I need. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm trying to find a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a significant increase on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $12,500 is tempting.  However, I have a firm budget, and I can't go beyond $11,500.  If that works for you, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his increases are incremental. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
