"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a win-win for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us.  While I'm motivated to sell, I also need to be fair to the product's value. Would you be willing to consider $8,200?  It's a small concession on my end and brings us closer to a deal.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle again?",7800.0,Bob,6,
