"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob won't accept it immediately. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to potentially gain a higher price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to  $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that's significantly less than John's offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep this conversation going!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is closer to $1,000,000.  If you're willing to work in that range, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, keeping the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $1,200,000 is pushing it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not ready to settle. I'll counter with a price slightly above his offer, hoping to close the deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,150,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let's seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is really my limit. I can do $1,125,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  If we can make this work, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum, Bob's offer is almost there, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing out on a deal with John."
