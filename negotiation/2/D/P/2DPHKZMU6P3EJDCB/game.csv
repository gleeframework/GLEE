"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep this conversation going!",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is closer to $1,000,000.  If you're willing to work in that range, I'm ready to make a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $1,200,000 is pushing it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's the best I can do.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,150,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let's seal the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is really my limit. I can do $1,125,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  If we can make this work, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
