"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,5,
