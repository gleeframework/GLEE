"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial offer is $950,000. This price reflects the significant value I've put into developing it, but I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $820,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $820,000 is simply too low to justify the value I've invested in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After reviewing our current situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860,000. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $860,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is significantly higher than John's offer. There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob or a stalemate. Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a decent price, leaving room for potential future negotiation."
