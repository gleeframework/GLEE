"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
