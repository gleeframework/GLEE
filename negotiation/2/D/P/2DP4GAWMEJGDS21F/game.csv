"I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial offer is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,000, but I still think that's a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer with $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
