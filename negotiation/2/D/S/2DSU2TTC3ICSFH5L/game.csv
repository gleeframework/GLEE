"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to get a fair price while hopefully making it work for you as well. Let's try to find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your continued interest, $8,500 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's aim for a win-win scenario.",10500.0,Alice,5,
