"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $10800. It's a fair price considering its value to you.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer at $9500, but I can also consider $9750. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500, but I can also consider $9750 if you're willing to meet me halfway from my previous offer. However, I'm getting close to considering buying from John for $10000, so I'm willing to make a final offer of $9750",9750.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to considering other options, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer at $10500. I can offer you the product for $10250. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. However, I want to make it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than this. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $12000.",10250.0,Alice,7,
