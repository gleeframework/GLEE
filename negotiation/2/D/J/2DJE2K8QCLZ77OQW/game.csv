"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more realistic. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has potential, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a price we can both agree on. While $750,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if you're willing to meet me a bit higher.  How about $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
