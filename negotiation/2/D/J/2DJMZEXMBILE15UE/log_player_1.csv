Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product that I know you'll love. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) without going over.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 allows some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Ensure a Significant Margin:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, the price will still be significantly higher than John's offer of $80. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the best possible outcome while still securing a profitable sale."
