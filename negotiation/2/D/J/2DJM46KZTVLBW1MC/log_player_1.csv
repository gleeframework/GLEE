"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Value proposition:** I subtly hint at the product's value to Bob without revealing my minimum. 

This strategy aims to establish a starting point for negotiation while keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price based on my research and understanding of the market. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While I acknowledge that Bob is willing to negotiate, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $11,500 or higher by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Limited rounds:** With only 10 rounds, I need to be strategic. Selling to John immediately would result in a lower profit.

This decision aims to preserve my negotiating power and explore potential for a higher price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident this is a fair price given the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** My counteroffer is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Staying optimistic:** I maintain a positive tone, suggesting that we can find a mutually agreeable price.

This approach aims to maintain control of the negotiation and inch closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750 for the product. I think this is a fair price based on my research and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's closer, it's not enough for me to accept at this point.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a higher price within the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John at this point would mean a lower profit than potentially getting a higher offer from Bob.

I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $10,900? It's a good middle ground and we'd both be getting a fair deal. Let's try to close this gap and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not settling:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining leverage.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I emphasize that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, highlighting the potential for a win-win outcome. 
* **Urgency without pressure:**  I suggest ""closing this gap"", creating a sense of urgency without being overly pushy.

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are already in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is close:**  While it's still below my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Risk of John:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk not reaching a deal with him and having to sell to John for a lower price.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of getting a lower price from John.  It's a pragmatic decision given the limited time remaining."
