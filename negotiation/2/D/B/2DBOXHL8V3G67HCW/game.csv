"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $12000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it, which is still a significant amount for me.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $8500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit beyond what I can manage right now. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to secure the product and you to get a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. Considering the product's value to you is $8000, I'm willing to offer you a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still slightly more than I can comfortably manage right now. I'm willing to pay $9500, which is a strong offer considering the product's value to you.  It's a fair price that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come together on this number.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500.
