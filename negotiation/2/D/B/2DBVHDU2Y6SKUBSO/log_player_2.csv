"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $10,000. I think you'll really love it and it's a great value for the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower since the product is only worth $8,000 to her.  You can try to get a better deal before resorting to John's higher price."
