"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering its true worth, I propose a price of $140 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $140. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, considering it's worth $120 to you and $150 to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in between. Considering the value you place on the product and aiming for mutual satisfaction, I would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This price respects both the value you see in it and the price range we've discussed. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $135 is less than your maximum of $150.
* **A fair compromise:** Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While you could try for a lower price, there's a risk Alice might refuse and you'd be stuck with John's higher price."
