"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it, considering it's worth $120 to you and $150 to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in between. Considering the value you place on the product and aiming for mutual satisfaction, I would like to counter with an offer of $135 for the product. This price respects both the value you see in it and the price range we've discussed. I hope this proposal works for you.",135.0,Alice,3,
