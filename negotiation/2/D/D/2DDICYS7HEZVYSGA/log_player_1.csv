"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a strong offer. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

$750,000 is still too low. I'm not ready to sell for that, but I'll continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
