"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $17,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16250.0,Alice,5,
