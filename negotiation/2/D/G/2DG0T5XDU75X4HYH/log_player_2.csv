"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's valued at $100 by many, and considering its quality and benefits, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95 today. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me. This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider. How about $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counteroffer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Establish a lower anchor:** By starting low, we aim to shift the negotiation towards a more favorable price point.

We'll adjust our strategy based on Alice's response in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make you an offer that might better suit your needs. Considering the value and benefits of the product, I'm willing to lower the price to $85. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice lowered her price, but it's still above her own valuation and a significant markup from what we'd ideally like to pay. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice, but $85 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** We acknowledge Alice's price reduction by slightly increasing our previous offer. 
* **Aim for a middle ground:**  $75 represents a compromise between our initial offer and Alice's current price. 
* **Maintain pressure:** We're still below Alice's valuation, encouraging her to consider a more substantial price reduction. 

We'll see how Alice responds and adjust our approach in the next round if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I propose a price of $80 for the product. This allows us to stay within your financial limits while ensuring we receive fair compensation for the value we're providing. Please let me know if this offer works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her valuation of $80.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and this price is within our budget and a good deal compared to John's offer of $100."
