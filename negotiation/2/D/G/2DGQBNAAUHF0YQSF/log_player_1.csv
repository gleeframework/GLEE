Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. My asking price is $110. It's a great deal considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me ($100) but lower than the perceived value to Bob ($80). 
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and optimistic, highlighting the potential value for Bob. I'm also leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential earnings:** By starting high, I have room to negotiate down. 
* **Keep Bob interested:** A reasonable initial offer avoids scaring him off.
* **Set the stage for counteroffers:**  This approach encourages Bob to engage and potentially offer a price closer to my desired range. 

I'm prepared to either negotiate with Bob further or sell to John if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than my minimum ($100), it's still below my desired range.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps this deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but firmly stating my counterproposal. I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a positive negotiation. I'm framing the $95 price as a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Price:**  $95 is a compromise that's closer to my desired range while still being within a reasonable distance from Bob's offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain a good relationship:** I'm keeping the negotiation amicable and avoiding confrontation.
* **Show flexibility:** My counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Increase my potential earnings:** I'm aiming for a higher price while still remaining open to negotiation.

I'm hopeful that Bob will accept my counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $90.  While I would prefer $95, it's not worth risking losing the sale and having to deal with John. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Potential loss:** If I reject, Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $100.
* **Minimal difference:** The difference between $92.50 and my minimum is only $2.50, which isn't a significant loss.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further negotiation and allows me to finalize the sale. 

It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risks when making decisions during negotiation. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible choice."
