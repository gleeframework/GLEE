"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you given its worth of $100 to you. Let's start the negotiation at $95. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its worth to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand your position, but I would like to keep the price closer to my valuation. How about we aim for $90? This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  Let's compromise at $88. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",88.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to move forward at $89. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive. I hope this works for you.",89.0,Alice,5,
