"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me and I believe it's a great value for you given its worth of $100 to you. Let's start the negotiation at $95. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, given its worth to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand your position, but I would like to keep the price closer to my valuation. How about we aim for $90? This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still closer to your ideal price of $80. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  Let's compromise at $88. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to move forward at $89. This price allows for a reasonable profit while still being competitive. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for you!  You're getting the product for $89, which is only $9 more than what it's worth to Alice.  While you could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and you risk losing the deal altogether. At this point, it's a better strategy to accept the offer and secure the purchase."
