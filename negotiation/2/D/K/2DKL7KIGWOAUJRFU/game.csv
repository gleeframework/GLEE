"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it for that low. I'm willing to compromise, though! I can offer you a deal for $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the price. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
