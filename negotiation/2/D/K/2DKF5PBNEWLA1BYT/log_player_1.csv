Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a reasonable starting point considering my minimum acceptable value is $100.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but still leave me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not ideal. Selling to John for $100 ensures I meet my minimum and avoids further negotiation. It's a quick and reliable solution."
