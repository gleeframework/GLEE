"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth.  While I value it at over $1.5 million, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
