Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $95. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $95, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's below his perceived value) while also maximizing your potential profit. 

This approach leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, but still ensures you a healthy profit above your minimum selling point."
