"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is a bit lower than I can comfortably go. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $2,000,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
