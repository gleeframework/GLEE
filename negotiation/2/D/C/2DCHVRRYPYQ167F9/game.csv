"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you, and it gives me a bit of profit.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price that considers its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let me know if this works for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your asking price. How about $1,075,000?  That's a significant increase from my initial offer and  shows I'm serious about reaching a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
