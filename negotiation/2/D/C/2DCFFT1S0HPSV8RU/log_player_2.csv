"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than the maximum you're willing to pay ($1,500,000) and higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($1,000,000). This means it's a good deal for both parties, allowing you to save money and Alice to make a profit."
