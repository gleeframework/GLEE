"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely get a better price than that! Alice is starting quite a bit lower than her value. Let's see if we can negotiate her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While that price is tempting, I'm looking to invest a bit less in this particular product. Would you be open to a price closer to $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you while also being more competitive than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. Let's see if we can nudge her down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $900,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you while also being more competitive than my previous offers.

We're getting close, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  We're still within range of a good deal, so let's push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is about as high as I can go.  If you're willing to meet there, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you while also being more competitive than my previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

It seems like Alice is no longer willing to budge in a meaningful way. Her latest offer is moving further away from our target price, not closer.  At this point, it's unlikely we'll get her down to a price that makes continuing negotiations worthwhile. It's time to cut our losses and buy from John.  While we won't save as much, we'll avoid wasting further time and secure the product."
