{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is more than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $95. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $87 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to squeeze out a few more dollars. I'll counter with a lower price again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $89 is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to pay $88 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I wanted to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and $88 is a decent profit. I'd rather take this deal than risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
