"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1950000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's unique features and rarity. What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1900000. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to prioritize my own interests.
