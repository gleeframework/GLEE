"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm excited about the possibility of selling the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
