Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $12,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-end item at a discount, and I'm confident you'll love it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. It's not a good deal for me. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm excited about the possibility of selling the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe I can get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,500, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $10,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above my budget. Although I'm willing to negotiate, I've already gone as high as I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum price point, rather than risk further negotiation that might not result in a satisfactory outcome."
