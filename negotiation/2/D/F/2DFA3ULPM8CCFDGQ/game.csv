"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I know you'll recognize its immense value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm confident that this price is fair considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront.  $950,000 is simply too far from what I consider a fair deal.  To move forward, I need to see you significantly closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",975000.0,Bob,6,
