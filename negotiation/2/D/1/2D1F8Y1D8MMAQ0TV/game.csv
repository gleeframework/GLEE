"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
