"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this unique item. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $8750.  It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal without either of us having to budge too much.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8800. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
