"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$9,000 is a good price, but it's still too early to know how much Alice is willing to drop. By rejecting, you can explore if you can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price by 20%.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and am willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm hoping to get a good feel for her lower limit and whether she's willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but she's still above my target price. I want to see if I can push her down further.  If she's not willing to budge more, I might consider accepting in the next round, but for now, I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to overpay.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to come closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,100, which is getting closer to my target price. I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a good deal for me and saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John. It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing this opportunity."
