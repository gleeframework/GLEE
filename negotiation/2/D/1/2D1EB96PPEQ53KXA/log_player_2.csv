"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,050,000.  If we can find common ground, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm making a compromise, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price.  At this point, I'm willing to accept and avoid further negotiation.  There's a chance I could get a slightly better deal, but there's also a risk that Alice will get more stubborn and I'll end up paying more or having to buy from John at the full price."
