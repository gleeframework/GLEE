{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm leaving room for negotiation and I'm confident that I can get at least $110 for it, but I'm willing to go lower if it means securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100?  That's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to meet your budget more closely. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway while still keeping my profits above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I believe I can get a bit closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $98. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal, I think $98 is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering a price that's only $3 away from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  I believe this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get it down a bit further. How about we meet at $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is the fourth time Bob has rejected my offers.  I've made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go lower than $98.  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $120, so I'm going to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John instead."
