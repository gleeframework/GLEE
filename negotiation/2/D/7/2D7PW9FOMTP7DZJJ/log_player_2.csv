"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's important to negotiate a better price, especially since I have a backup option with John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,025,000 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be fair to myself in this negotiation. The product's value is undeniable, and $1,000,000 is my absolute lowest price.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has reached her lowest price, which is a good deal for me.  There's no guarantee I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to John."
