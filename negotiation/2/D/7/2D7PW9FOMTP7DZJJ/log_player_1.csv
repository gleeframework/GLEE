Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,025,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below our minimum and Bob is incrementally increasing his offer. We need to push back firmer while staying in the negotiation to try and secure a better price.  Selling to John is our backup if the negotiations fail to progress."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be fair to myself in this negotiation. The product's value is undeniable, and $1,000,000 is my absolute lowest price.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We've reached a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested, but trying to lowball.  By stating this is our absolute lowest and a firm offer, we force Bob to make a decision and show we're serious about the $1,000,000 minimum.  This leaves no room for further haggling on our end but keeps the door open for Bob to accept."
