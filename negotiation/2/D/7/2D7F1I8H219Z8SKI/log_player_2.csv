"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice and $120 to me.  Alice is offering $115 which means I can get a better price. I will reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle, I think we can both be happy with this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is still within my budget and a good deal for both of us. Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
