Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This is a good starting point for negotiation as it allows room for bargaining while still ensuring I'm potentially making a good profit.

**Strategy:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  I want to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential gains.
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate, so I'm not setting a ""take it or leave it"" price.
* **Safety Net:**  The presence of John as a backup buyer gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. I want to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to hold out for a better price.
* **Test the Waters:**  By counteroffering, I can gauge Bob's true willingness to pay.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to buy for $1,000,000 gives me a safety net if the negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin. It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Signal of Flexibility:**  This shows Bob that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain Value:**  This price is still significantly higher than my minimum value, ensuring that I still make a substantial profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Iterative Negotiation:**  I'm using counteroffers to gradually narrow the gap between our desired prices.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  This counteroffer allows me to assess Bob's seriousness in buying the product at a price closer to my initial expectation.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have the option to sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now only $100,000 below my minimum acceptable price. Given the possibility of further negotiation being time-consuming and potentially leading to a lower offer, accepting his offer seems like the most practical decision.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away or further lower his offer. Accepting this offer minimizes that risk.
* **Achieving Profit:**  While not at my ideal price, I still achieve a significant profit of $100,000.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Accepting the offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on to other opportunities.

**Conclusion:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I ensure a sale with a reasonably good profit, avoiding potential delays and uncertainties associated with further negotiation."
