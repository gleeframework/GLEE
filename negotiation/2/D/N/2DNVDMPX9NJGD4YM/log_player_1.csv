"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  I think it's a great deal for you considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob. This allows for some room for negotiation and potentially reaches a mutually beneficial agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful that I can squeeze out a little more. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $108? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $102, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point,  I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while I would prefer a higher price,  $102 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's a reasonable offer, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
