"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $8000. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible.  However,  $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is no less than $8000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price or if you'd like to negotiate further.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $9000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $8750 for the product. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $8800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is no less than $8000. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price or if you'd like to negotiate further.",8800.0,Alice,5,
