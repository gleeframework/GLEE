"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
