# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  You're better off seeing if she'll reduce the price further before accepting."
