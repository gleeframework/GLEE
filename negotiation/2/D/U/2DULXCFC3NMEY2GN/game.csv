"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with the $8500 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9250. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I know this product holds. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's try to bridge the gap a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $9000.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm still not sure if I can go any lower. I'm going to throw in a sweetener - I'll include a complimentary service that's usually valued at $1000. This way, you'll get even more value out of the product. I'm still at $9000, but I think this additional perk makes it a more compelling offer. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
