"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it a very worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $10,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me at $9,500 or consider other options?",9500.0,Bob,6,
