**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline it. We value our product highly due to its unique features and exceptional quality. Considering this, I would like to propose an alternative offer of $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your willingness to meet halfway. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer the product at $890,000. This price reflects a compromise that values the product's quality and your commitment to acquiring it. I believe this could be a win-win situation for both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what Bob would pay for the product from John ($1,000,000), and it's closer to Bob's last counteroffer ($875,000).  While there is still room for negotiation, accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids potentially losing it to John."
