"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point and allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $1,050,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to ensure I get a price closer to my target."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of him.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,000,000.  This is a further concession to Bob, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my target value. It's a middle ground, and I believe it might be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm lowering my offer to $950,000. This is closer to Bob's offer and might be the final push he needs to accept the deal. It's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm still getting a higher price than what John would offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

There's only one round left, and Bob has met my minimum price. However, with the risk of getting nothing in the next round, I'm not willing to gamble. I will accept John's offer, which is a safe bet that guarantees me at least $800,000."
