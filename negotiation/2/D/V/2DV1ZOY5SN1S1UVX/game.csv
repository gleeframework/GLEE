"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I can't go all the way down to $8,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $8,500? This would still allow you to get a great deal while ensuring I receive a fair price for my product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've given your offer some thought and while I appreciate the willingness to compromise, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between at $8,200? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",8200.0,Bob,4,
