"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I suggest we discuss a price that reflects its worth while ensuring it's a fair deal for both of us. Considering the product's true value and your interest in it, I propose a price of $120. This allows you to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its cost to me, while still leaving room for negotiation if needed. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of our expectations.
