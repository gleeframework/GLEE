Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim to get at least that amount from Bob.
* **Leave No Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($100) avoids unnecessary back and forth. 
* **Justify the Price:**  While optional, briefly mentioning the value the product provides might make Bob more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but you'll still sell the product to John for your desired price. This strategy ensures you never sell below your minimum."
