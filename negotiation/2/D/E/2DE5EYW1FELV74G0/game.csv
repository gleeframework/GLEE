,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can offer you a price of $100, which is a significant discount from the original $150. Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price Alice, but $100 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers at $80? That would be a fair deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $80 is still below my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but there's still a gap. I'm willing to move up slightly from my last offer. How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product while staying within my budget.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer you a price of $115, which is getting closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",115.0,Alice,7,
