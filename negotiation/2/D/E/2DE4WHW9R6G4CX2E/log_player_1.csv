Bob's offer of $840,000 is getting closer, but I'm running out of rounds.  I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from Bob, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and ensures I don't miss out on the opportunity altogether."
