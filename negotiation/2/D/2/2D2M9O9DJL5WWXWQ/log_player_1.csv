Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its significant value and potential for your business. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  To show my serious interest, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This price reflects the significant value I've placed on this product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price in this round."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer.  I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price point. To make a deal happen, I'm willing to offer the product for $950,000. This is a compromise on my part, but it's the lowest I can go right now.  Let's close this deal in this round!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal in this round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum, and it's better than selling to John for $1,000,000. We're close to the end of our rounds, and it's time to secure the deal."
