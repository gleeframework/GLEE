"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its significant value and potential for your business. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This price reflects the significant value I've placed on this product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price in this round.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price point. To make a deal happen, I'm willing to offer the product for $950,000. This is a compromise on my part, but it's the lowest I can go right now.  Let's close this deal in this round! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
