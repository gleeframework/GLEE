Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too far off.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and a good starting point for a successful deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $1,275,000?  It's a good middle ground and would allow us to finalize this deal.
