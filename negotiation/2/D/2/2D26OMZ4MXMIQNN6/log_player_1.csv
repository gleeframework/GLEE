"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum requirement. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. $1,100,000 is far too low for me. I need to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too far off.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and a good starting point for a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  While $1,300,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,225,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $1,275,000?  It's a good middle ground and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $1,250,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can wrap this up today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,250,000 is a good price and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000. It's also getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
