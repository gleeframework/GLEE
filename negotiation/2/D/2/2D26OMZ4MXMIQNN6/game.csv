"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly above my minimum requirement. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is simply too far off.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and a good starting point for a successful deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  While $1,300,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you consider $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this work.  Would you consider $1,275,000?  It's a good middle ground and would allow us to finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to budge a bit more. How about $1,250,000? That's a fair compromise, and we can wrap this up today.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
