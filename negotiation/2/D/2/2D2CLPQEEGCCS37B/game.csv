"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for the product, but I'm open to discussing a price closer to that number.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay $10000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $11000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm happy to pay $10500 for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $10800? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
