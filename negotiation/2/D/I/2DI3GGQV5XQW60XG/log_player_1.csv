Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, the message implies a willingness to discuss the price further. 
* **Backup Plan:** We know John will buy it for $1,200,000, so we must aim higher than that.

This offer strikes a balance between ambition and realism, giving us the best chance of securing a high sale price from Bob."
