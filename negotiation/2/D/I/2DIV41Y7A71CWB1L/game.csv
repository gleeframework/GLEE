I have a unique and valuable product that I think you'll be interested in. Would you like to make an offer?,1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, but $1500000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $600000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my maximum budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600000 is a bit low considering its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $1200000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if we're close enough to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1050000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
