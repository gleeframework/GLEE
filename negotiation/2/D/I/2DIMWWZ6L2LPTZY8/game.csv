"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a compromise here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a better deal. Would you consider $1,250,000? It's a significant investment for me, and I want to make sure it's the right decision.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
