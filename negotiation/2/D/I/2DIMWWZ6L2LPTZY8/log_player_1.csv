Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?

I'm still trying to get a higher price. Bob's offer is closer, but I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll counter again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what I'm hoping for.  Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,275,000.
