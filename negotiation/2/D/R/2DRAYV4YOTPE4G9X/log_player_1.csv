Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, knowing I can negotiate down if needed.  I'm also making it personal to try and build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but $120 is well below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great deal for a product you'll love, and it's still a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer more, accepting $130 is better than selling to John for $150 or continuing to negotiate with Bob.  The risk of him walking away entirely is too high at this point."
