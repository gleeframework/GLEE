"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident will bring you great returns. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to you, I believe $975,000 is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking that we're getting close to a deal, and I want to keep the negotiation going. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is a significant step towards finding a middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's the best we can do. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're nearing the end of our negotiations, and I want to see if we can reach a final agreement. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given the progress we've made, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,020,000.  This is a significant step towards finding a middle ground, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal.",1020000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that we're at the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 one more time, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. Let's see if we can make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
