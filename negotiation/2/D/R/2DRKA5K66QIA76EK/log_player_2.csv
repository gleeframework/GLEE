"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better price than Alice's original value, it's still above Bob's maximum. There are rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum of $8,000 as possible. A counteroffer of $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  While it's a slight improvement from her previous offer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Bob has several rounds left, so there's time to see if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $8,750 is still below his maximum, and it's closer to the $9,000 that Alice is willing to accept. This shows a genuine attempt to close the deal while still getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still a bit above it.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to push for a price even closer to his target and potentially save an additional $100 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his maximum. He's increasing his offer again, but just slightly, demonstrating a genuine effort to reach an agreement.  He's also showing Alice that he's willing to pay a bit more than his initial goal, which might encourage her to accept.  This strategy aims to secure a deal while minimizing his expenditure."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. While Bob's goal was to get the product for $8,000, Alice is now offering $8,850. This is only $850 over his target.  With only three rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is that Alice might raise the price or even reject future offers entirely.  At this point, accepting the offer secures the product for a price that is still within a reasonable range and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. It's a calculated risk, balancing potential savings against the chance of not getting the product at all."
