Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so we need to offer a price lower than his valuation but high enough to maximize our profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quicker.

**Why not higher?**  While we know John will buy it for $1,500,000, starting too high might make Bob immediately reject the offer without a counter-proposal. 

**Why not lower?** Going much lower than $1,350,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table, especially since we have John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
