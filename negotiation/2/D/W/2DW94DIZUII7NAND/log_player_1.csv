Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000, meaning she won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $1,500,000 to John.

**The Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay, knowing she has a backup offer.  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, Alice should start negotiations slightly below this to leave room for bargaining.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $975,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 975000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Starting Point:** The offer of $975,000 is attractive to Bob as it's below his perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The wording suggests a willingness to negotiate, allowing Bob to feel involved and potentially increasing the final price.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice is secure knowing if Bob rejects the offer, she has John's guaranteed purchase. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob, potentially increasing the price closer to $1,000,000. However, she should never sell below her minimum of $1,500,000 as she has a guaranteed buyer in John."
