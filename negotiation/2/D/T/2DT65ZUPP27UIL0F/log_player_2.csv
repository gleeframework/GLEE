"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is well above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's best to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but unfortunately, $180 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $160 is closer to his budget, it's still above his limit. He should continue negotiating to try and get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $140. This is my final offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $152. It's still a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $152 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Since Bob has limited rounds, it's better to secure the product for $120 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
