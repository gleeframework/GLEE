Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To facilitate a deal, I am willing to consider your last offer of $7,750. However, due to the high-quality nature of the product, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose a final offer of $8,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
