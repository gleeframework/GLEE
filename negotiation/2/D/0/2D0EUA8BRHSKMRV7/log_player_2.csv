"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $110
* **John's price:** $120

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price and higher than her minimum price, it's a good deal for both of you. Accepting her offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
