Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:** My message emphasizes that the offer is good for both of us. This creates a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm not aiming for a ""take it or leave it"" approach.  This allows for a back-and-forth that could potentially lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **The backup plan:**  Remembering my minimum price ($120), I'm open to negotiation, but I have a guaranteed sale with John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $90 is only $10 below my minimum price of $120.  I'm willing to accept a slight loss to avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it also risks Bob walking away entirely or taking more time.  
* **Guaranteed sale:**  While I'm accepting less than ideal, I'm still securing a sale.  If I were to reject Bob and negotiate further, I run the risk of ending up with nothing."
