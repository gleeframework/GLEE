"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price, but $1,150,000 is still not workable for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,250,000? This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $1,180,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,220,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's get this deal done.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
