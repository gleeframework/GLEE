"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
