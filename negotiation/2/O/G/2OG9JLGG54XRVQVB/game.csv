"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the deal, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to buy it for $100, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you in the middle at $125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110, and I'm sure you'll find that a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can meet you at $120, but that's as low as I can go. This is the minimum price I need to make a profit, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at the minimum!",120.0,Alice,5,
