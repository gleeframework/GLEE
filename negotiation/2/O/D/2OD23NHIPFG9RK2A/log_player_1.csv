Round 4

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,200,000 mark within the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer of $1,050,000 would result in a significant loss compared to John's standing offer. 

It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
