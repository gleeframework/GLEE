"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the numerous benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's no point in buying from John yet, as Bob can potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good price considering the value you've described.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob can continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further. There's no need to buy from John yet, as Bob has a chance to secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best option for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to make one final concession at $16,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the quality and benefits of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's getting closer. There's a good chance that Bob can get a better deal with a counteroffer. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
