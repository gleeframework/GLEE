Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start around $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer is lower than my initial price, $650,000 is just too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. However, $725,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This gives you a substantial saving while still allowing me to achieve my desired outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $812,500? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come away with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500

Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000. It's time to cut negotiations and buy from John at the guaranteed price."
