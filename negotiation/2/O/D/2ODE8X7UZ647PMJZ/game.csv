"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer is lower than my initial price, $650,000 is just too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. However, $725,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This gives you a substantial saving while still allowing me to achieve my desired outcome. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $812,500? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come away with a good deal.",812500.0,Alice,7,
