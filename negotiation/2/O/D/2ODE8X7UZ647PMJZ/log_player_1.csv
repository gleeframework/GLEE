"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be a price that makes sense for both of us. How about we start around $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $650,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer is lower than my initial price, $650,000 is just too far off for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop to $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point that works for me. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, $725,000 is still far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, and I still have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. I'm willing to keep talking, but I need to see a more significant increase in his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. However, $725,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This gives you a substantial saving while still allowing me to achieve my desired outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to sell it for that low. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob but need to see a more significant increase in his offer. I'm still considering selling to John for $1,000,000, which is a better outcome for me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. To make this work, I need to be closer to $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $812,500? I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to come away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
