"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $825000. Is this a more acceptable price for you?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still thinking that $825000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $775000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $815000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our previous negotiations.",815000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $815000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775000 and $815000, so I'll propose a price of $800000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $800000 just yet. Considering the product's value and the effort I've invested, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering it to you for $825000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm starting to think that this product is not as valuable to me as you think it is. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'm now offering $785000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",785000.0,Bob,8,
