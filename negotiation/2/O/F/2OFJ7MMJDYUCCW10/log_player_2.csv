"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested in proceeding. If not, I have another buyer lined up at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's a fair price for Alice, it's not a good deal for you. You can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option to save money."
