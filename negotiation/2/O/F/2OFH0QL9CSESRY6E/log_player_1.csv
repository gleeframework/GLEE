"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to gauge Bob's interest. I'm hoping he'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, selling to John for $12,000 is still a good option. However, I'll reject Bob's offer for now and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is still above my minimum value and gives Bob some room to negotiate, but it also shows I'm serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I'm not sure he's willing to negotiate much higher.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway this round by offering $10,500. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to go back and forth a few more rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for $12,000.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
