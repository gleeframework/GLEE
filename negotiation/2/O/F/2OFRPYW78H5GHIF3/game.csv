"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and more than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,500?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  This would allow both of us to come away with a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $11,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
