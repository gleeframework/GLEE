"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $18000 for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is a very competitive price considering the product's value and my target profit margin. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $15000. Would you be willing to consider $15200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget.",15200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $15200. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my limits. Would you be willing to consider $15500? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $16250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",16250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm counteroffering at $16500 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,9,
