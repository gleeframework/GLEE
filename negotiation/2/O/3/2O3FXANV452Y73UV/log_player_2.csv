"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $80 from John, so he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $80 from John, so he should continue to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $80.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what John is offering. Bob has already made several counteroffers and it's unlikely he can get Alice to go any lower. It's time to secure the best deal possible."
