"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is getting closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, but if it doesn't work out, I'm ready to sell to John for $120."
