"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider $950,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything lower than $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
