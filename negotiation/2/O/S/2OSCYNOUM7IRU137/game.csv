"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more equitable agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still offers you a significant value for a product worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you, while staying within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
