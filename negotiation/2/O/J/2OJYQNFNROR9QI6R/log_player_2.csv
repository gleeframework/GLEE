It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice since $90 is a good price, but there might be room for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm going to try to get the price down to $80. This is still a good deal for me, and it leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

$85 is a good price for the product and it's better than the $120 John is asking for."
