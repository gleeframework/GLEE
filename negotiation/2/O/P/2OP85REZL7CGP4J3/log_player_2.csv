"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $1,100,000.  By rejecting the offer, you can start a counteroffer process and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  That's a fair price considering my maximum value for the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what you are willing to pay. While you could continue negotiating, you can secure the product from John for $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget."
