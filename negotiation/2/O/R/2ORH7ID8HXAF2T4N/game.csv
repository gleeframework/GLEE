"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value you've mentioned.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but  $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price acknowledges the value it brings while remaining within a reasonable range.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This price would be a good compromise, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
