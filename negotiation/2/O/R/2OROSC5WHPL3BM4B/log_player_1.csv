"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to me.  This gives me some room to negotiate, and it's also a strong starting point to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to him, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $105?  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still going to reject this offer.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $100.  I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before accepting that guaranteed offer.  I'll counteroffer and see what happens."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price a little more to $100. That's my absolute bottom line, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $100 is your bottom line, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, we're still $2 apart.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not likely we'll be able to reach an agreement.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and it's the safest option to ensure I don't lose out on a good deal."
