"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the condition of your product, $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for a product in this condition. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,
