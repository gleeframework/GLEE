"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to buy the product for $800,000 or less. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and is closer to my desired price point.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, it's still above my target price.  I'm not in a rush, and I want to see if I can get her closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $875,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still holding firm to my target price.  This should be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still far too high.  I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation and I'm not seeing a willingness from Alice to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's clear that Alice is trying to push for a higher price.  At this point, it's more beneficial to simply buy from John and save the time and energy of further negotiation."
