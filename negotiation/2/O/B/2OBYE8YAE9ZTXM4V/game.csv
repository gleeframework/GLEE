"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm ready to pay $8000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $8000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with another option.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort to compromise.  $9500 is still a little too high for me.  How about $8500? That's a fair price for both of us and would let me buy the product from you.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. This is a compromise that's closer to my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $9000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8250? This is a good compromise, and it's closer to my limit. Let me know what you think.",8250.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that $8250 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $8750. This is a compromise that's closer to your offer, but I'm still trying to get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,9,
