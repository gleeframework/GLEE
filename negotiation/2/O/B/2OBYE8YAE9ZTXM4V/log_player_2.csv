"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,500 is more than his maximum budget of $8,000, and he can get the product from John for cheaper.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm ready to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than his maximum of $8,000.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on $8,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $9500. This is still a good deal for me, considering the value I place on the product, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still more than he's willing to spend.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since John is offering the product for $8,000. There are still a few rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort to compromise.  $9,500 is still a little too high for me.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us and would let me buy the product from you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $9000. This is a compromise that's closer to my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer of $9,000.  It's still higher than his maximum of $8,000 and he can get the product from John for that price.  With only a few rounds left, Bob should try to get Alice closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,250? This is a good compromise, and it's closer to my limit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8250 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price of $8750. This is a compromise that's closer to your offer, but I'm still trying to get a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While $8,750 is closer to his budget, there's only one round left to negotiate. Alice is likely to continue to be stubborn about the price, and Bob is running out of time to get a better deal.  It's more efficient and cost-effective to purchase the product from John at his guaranteed price of $8,000."
