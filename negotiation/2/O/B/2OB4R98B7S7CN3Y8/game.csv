"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident that this price reflects its true value.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.  I'm eager to reach an agreement, so let's see if we can work something out.",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there on the price.  How about we meet at $850,000?  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product, and it's a good starting point for us to find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see it's a great deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price.",860000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $860,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going. Let's split the difference and finalize this at $855,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this sale and avoid any further back and forth.",855000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $855,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $858,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",858000.0,Alice,7,
