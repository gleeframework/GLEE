"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $15000 is your max budget, but I was really hoping to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $17000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $17500. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",16500.0,Alice,5,
