"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm offering you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8,200 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $8,200 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,350.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's make this happen.",8350.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your effort in negotiating. I would like to counter with a price of $8,250 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between value and cost for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,6,
