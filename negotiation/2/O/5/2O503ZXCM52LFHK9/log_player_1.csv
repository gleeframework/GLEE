{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is a bit aggressive, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product for Bob.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000, so I will reject his offer. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $11,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $11,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum threshold of $10,000 and still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Accepting his offer will ensure a sale and prevent any further negotiation."
