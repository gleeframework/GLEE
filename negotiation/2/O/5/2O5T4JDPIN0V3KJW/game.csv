"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $975,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  Let's make this our final exchange to see if we can make a deal.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 even. This is my absolute limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1,025,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
