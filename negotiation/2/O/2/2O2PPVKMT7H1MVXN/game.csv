"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While the product is very appealing, $10,800 is still a bit above my budget. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. How about I offer it to you for $11,000? This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11000.0,Alice,5,
