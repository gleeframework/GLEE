"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking for a better price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his initial target of $10,500. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,500. Let's split the difference and I'll offer you $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal without going over my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $11,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently pushing for a lower price, and Alice has also shown a willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is a good middle ground, and while Bob would ideally like to pay less, it's within his budget and a decent saving compared to John's offer.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal before further rounds of negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or a need to purchase from John."
