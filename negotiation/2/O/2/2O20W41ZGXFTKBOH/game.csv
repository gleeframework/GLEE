"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,250. I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $10,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're serious about selling, I believe we can finalize a deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,6,
