"Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than to others. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. This reflects its true worth and the significant benefits you'll gain.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000 would be a fair starting point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident its value will become even clearer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us. $1,050,000 is still too high. I'm willing to move up to $950,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects my understanding of the product's immense value to your specific needs while acknowledging your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000 to show my commitment to getting this deal done.  I think this is a very fair price and reflects the value it brings to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. To demonstrate my flexibility, I'm willing to accept $1,012,000. This is a final offer, reflecting the product's significant value and our progress in this negotiation.",1012000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you said that's your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a way to make this work.  I can go up to $985,000.  If we can't agree on this, then I may have to explore other options.",985000.0,Bob,8,
