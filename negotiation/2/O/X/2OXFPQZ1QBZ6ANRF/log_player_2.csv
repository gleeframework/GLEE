Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to invest a bit less, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is better than her first one, I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I can try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my ideal price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,200,000? I think it's a fair price, and it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

**Reasoning:**  Alice's final offer is the same as her initial offer, which is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's not my ideal price, but it's a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, so accepting is the best option in this situation."
