"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price for both of us and gives Bob a reason to negotiate. It also leaves some room for me to lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe there should be room for negotiation. I would like to propose $90 as the final price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my preferred price, but it's only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price.  Given that we're already on round 4, I'd rather accept his offer and close the deal. There's no guarantee that I can get a better price in the next rounds, and selling to John for $120 carries the risk that the negotiation with Bob could have resulted in a better price."
