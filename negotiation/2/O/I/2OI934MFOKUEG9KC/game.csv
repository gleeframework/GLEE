,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $60 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $50 for the product. Let me know what you think.",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $55.",55.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $55 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. How about $52?  It's a small difference, but it could make a big impact for me.",52.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $52 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $53. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",53.0,Alice,5,
