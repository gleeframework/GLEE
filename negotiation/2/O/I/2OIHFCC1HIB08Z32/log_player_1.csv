"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By mentioning I'm open to negotiation, I signal flexibility and make it seem like Bob can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I have a guaranteed sale with John. It's worth seeing if I can push Bob closer to my price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum.
* **Reasoning:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""fair price considering the value"") to make it seem less arbitrary.
* **Openness:** I finish with an invitation to discuss further, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $92 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While $92 is tempting, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $100, and I still have six rounds to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $92 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $94.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum, and hopefully just close enough to entice him.
* **Reasoning:** I'm  emphasizing the ""fair compromise"" to make it seem like a good deal for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $94 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92, which I think is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob is refusing to budge on his offer of $92.  This is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and I'm not comfortable going lower.  To guarantee a profit and avoid further negotiation, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100."
