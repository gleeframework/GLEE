"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,750,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counterproposal. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant and goes beyond the $1,750,000 mark.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $2,000,000. This offer reflects a substantial compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's inherent worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. However, $2,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that $1,850,000 is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. I believe this offer is a solid middle ground and would allow us to finalize this transaction quickly.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,4,

Please consider this carefully â€“ opportunities like this are rare.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
