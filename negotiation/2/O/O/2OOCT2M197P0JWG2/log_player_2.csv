"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000. This means there's still room for negotiation, and you can likely get it for closer to your $800,000 limit.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1050000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value the product will bring to you.

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000, but that's still more than you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price. You can still make a counteroffer, and maybe even secure a better deal than Jhon's $800,000 offer."

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to your limit, you can still try to squeeze out a little more.  You can counteroffer again and try to get it down to $900,000 or even a bit lower. You're not too far from your target price, and you can still potentially save some money."

Alice is now offering $940,000, which is closer to your limit, but you're still within the range of John's offer.  Since you're only $40,000 away from John's offer, it's not worth continuing the negotiation.  The risk of further negotiation backfiring and ending up with a higher price than John's offer is too high. It's best to go with the sure thing and purchase from John at $800,000."
