Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $10,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make more than your minimum. 
* **Polite and Value-Oriented:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer seriously."
