Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get a better deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I still have room to negotiate and potentially earn more.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great value for you. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to be closer to $9,000.  I'm offering $8,900.  Let's close this deal and both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $8825. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,825

While I'd like to get closer to $9,000, I've only got 4 rounds left. Accepting Bob's offer will ensure a profit for me. I'm not comfortable risking losing the deal and getting only $8,000 from John."
