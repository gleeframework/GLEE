Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially earn more.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This makes the offer attractive to Bob and increases the likelihood of him accepting it.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This keeps the negotiation open and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your counteroffers based on his responses and your willingness to negotiate further.  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $800,000 if you feel the negotiation isn't going your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than your desired price and what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still reflects the significant value this product holds for you, and it gives us both room to close a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** By coming down from $1,200,000, you demonstrate flexibility.
* **Remains significantly higher than your minimum:** You're still well above your $800,000 floor.
* **Remains attractive to Bob:**  $1,000,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering his perceived value of $1,500,000.

This approach aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your desired price and your perceived value of the product. You are still close to your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but you should try to push for a higher price before considering selling to John. Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position. Let's try $975,000. It's a good compromise that allows us to both close this deal and leaves you with a valuable product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 975000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:** It's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Remains higher than your minimum:** It's still above your floor price of $800,000.
* **Positions it as a final offer:**  This adds urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.

This final offer is a balanced approach, aiming to reach an agreement without pushing Bob too far and risking losing the deal."
