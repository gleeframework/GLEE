"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $1,150,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a significant value for the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is a good deal for you. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further negotiation or going to John for a higher price."
