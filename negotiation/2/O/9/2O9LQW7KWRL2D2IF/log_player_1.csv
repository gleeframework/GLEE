Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,000,000) and leaves room for negotiation while still being attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing profit:**  By starting high, I increase the chances of getting a good deal.
* **Negotiation space:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum value while ensuring a good return for myself.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  The starting price is still above my minimum, so even if negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well above your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is still above my minimum value of $1,000,000, it's significantly lower than the price I initially offered ($1,150,000).
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and counteroffering.

**Next steps:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that is more favorable to me. This allows me to try and secure a higher profit while still maintaining the possibility of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives you a significant value for the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Negotiation:** I've moved from my initial offer of $1,150,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This shows Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal but also that I won't settle for a price too far below my desired outcome.
* **Maintaining Value:** $1,100,000 is still well above my minimum value of $1,000,000, ensuring I get a decent profit. It also leaves some space for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message emphasizes a collaborative approach and finding a solution that benefits both parties."
