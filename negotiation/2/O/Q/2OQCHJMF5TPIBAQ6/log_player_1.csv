"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a high final price. 
* **Justification and Openness:** I provide a brief justification for the high price, highlighting the product's value. I also signal a willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to engage in the process.
* **Strategic Reserve (John):**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me a strong bargaining position. I can afford to be more assertive in my initial offer knowing I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant move towards my target range, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of accepting the first counteroffer. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** By not immediately accepting, I reinforce the idea that the product holds significant value.
* **Guide the Negotiation:**  Rejecting pushes Bob to justify his valuation further and potentially increase his offer in the next round.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I still have John as a backup, giving me the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation doesn't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. While $1,800,000 is a considerable investment on your part, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? This represents a meaningful compromise from my end, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's offer as ""considerable"" but counter with a smaller concession of $150,000.  Importantly, I connect this counteroffer to the ""product's worth,"" reinforcing my position.
* **Aiming High:** I'm still above Bob's valuation, but this keeps the negotiation moving and allows for potential further compromises.
* **Time Consideration:**  While I have time, I also want to avoid unnecessary delays. This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate seriously without dropping too low too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your initial price, Alice, but $2,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,950,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **""Highest I'm Willing to Go"":** Bob's language suggests this is likely his final offer. Pushing further risks a stalemate or him walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Securing a deal now at a good price outweighs the potential for slightly more in later rounds, especially with the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
