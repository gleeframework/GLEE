I believe its true worth exceeds $1,500,000, reflecting its rarity, craftsmanship, and historical significance.

I propose selling the product to you for $950,000. This amount reflects a fair valuation while allowing you to secure a substantial asset at a premium compared to its market value. Given your discerning taste and financial acumen, I am confident this offer will resonate with your interests and aspirations.
