Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** You want to get as much as possible above your minimum price of $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer in John, aiming higher with Bob could result in a more profitable outcome."
