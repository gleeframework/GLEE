Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $125 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  By offering $125, I'm leaving some room for negotiation while still making a good profit.  I'm also being friendly and expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not going to accept it right away.  Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested! While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  Would you consider $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
