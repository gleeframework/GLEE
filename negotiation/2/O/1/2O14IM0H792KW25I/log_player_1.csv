Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll accept no less than $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin ($150,000) while still offering Bob a $50,000 discount from his perceived value. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves a little room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow room for concessions.
* **Relationship Building:** Even in a one-time transaction, a positive and respectful tone can go a long way."
