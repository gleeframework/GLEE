Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000 price:** This is a compromise between my minimum value ($15,000) and Bob's maximum value ($10,000). It gives Bob a good deal, while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **The message:** It's friendly and highlights the benefits for Bob, making him more likely to accept the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize my chances of selling to Bob at a price higher than John's offer, while still leaving room for negotiation."
