Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for profit above your minimum.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. You can always go down a little and still get a great deal.
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** While you have John as a backup, selling to Bob at $14,000 is more profitable than John's $12,000 offer."
