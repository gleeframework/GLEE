"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  That's a good price for both of us, and lets us close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for less than what it's worth to you. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I'm still a bit short of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalise the deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
