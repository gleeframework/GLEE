Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price quickly. Selling to John ensures I get my desired amount without further negotiation.
