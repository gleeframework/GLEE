"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I'm comfortable going. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
