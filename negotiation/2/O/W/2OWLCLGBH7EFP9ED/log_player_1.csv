Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It sets a strong starting point:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product and are not afraid to ask for a fair price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than $80, it's still significantly below what you're hoping for.  You've already established a higher price point, and you can likely get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $100.  How about we split the difference and do $110?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **It's a clear middle ground:** It simplifies the negotiation and makes it easier for Bob to say yes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a decent price, considering you're only a few dollars away from your desired price.  You could continue to negotiate, but the chance of getting a significantly higher offer is low.  It's better to secure the deal with Bob and avoid any risk of losing the sale altogether."
