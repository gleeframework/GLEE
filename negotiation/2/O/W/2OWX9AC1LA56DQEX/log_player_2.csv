"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,200,000 but still within your budget. However, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While it sounds great, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than your initial target of $1,200,000, but it's still within your budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate, or you might run out of rounds.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the deal at a reasonable price."
