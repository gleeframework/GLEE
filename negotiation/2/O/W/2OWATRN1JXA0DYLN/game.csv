"Bob, I understand your position. While $750,000 is a good offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still allows me to make a good profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.
