"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $108? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",108.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not comfortable with $112. I'm willing to go up to $109, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",109.0,Bob,6,
