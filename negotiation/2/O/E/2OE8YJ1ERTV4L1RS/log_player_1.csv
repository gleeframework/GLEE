Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to reasonable offers."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By saying you're open to reasonable offers, you invite Bob to counter-propose and engage in a negotiation. 
* **Not Anchoring Too Low:** While Bob only values the product at $80, you don't want to anchor the negotiation too close to that number. Starting at $150 leaves space for a potential agreement above Bob's perceived value if he's convinced of the product's worth to him. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might outright reject the $150 offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you're not losing anything by aiming for a higher price with Bob first."
