"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $115.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** $115 is still below my minimum value of $120, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets the stage for a potentially successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:**  Bob is offering significantly below my minimum value of $120.
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have the leverage here. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still a chance to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John. The potential for a better price with Bob is worth exploring further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and could increase the likelihood of a deal.
* **Positive Framing:**  Using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""good deal"" emphasizes a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $107.50 is higher than my minimum of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By offering a specific amount, I'm putting the ball back in Bob's court and creating pressure for him to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $105 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I'm not yet desperate enough to settle for $105, and there's still room for me to try and get a better price. 
* **Potential for More:**  There's a chance that Bob might budge a little more with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still not ready to sell to John. I have a few more rounds to see if I can reach a more favorable deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come up a little bit.  How about $106? It's a small compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a slight increase from my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Fair Deal Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""fair deal"" for both of us reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategic Increase:**  A smaller increase, like $1, could be more tempting for Bob to accept, as it's closer to his offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum value and leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. How about $104? That's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $104. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $104
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $104 is still below my minimum value of $120. 
* **Potential for More:** While Bob is offering his ""lowest,"" there's still a chance he might budge further. He's shown a willingness to negotiate throughout the rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but I'm hesitant to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob. I've already invested several rounds in this negotiation, and there's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Strategic Approach:** By rejecting the offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $104 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference one more time and go with $105? I'm really close to accepting, so let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:**  I'm offering a final compromise, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Emphasizing Proximity:**  Stating that I'm ""really close to accepting"" puts pressure on Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Last Chance:**  This is likely my last chance to get a better price from Bob before I consider John's offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Splitting the difference again shows a willingness to find a fair solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're close to accepting, but I really need to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $103, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $103. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $103
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're down to our last few rounds. 
* **Below Minimum:** $103 is still below my minimum value of $120, and the chances of Bob going higher are slim. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer again, the risk of not reaching a deal with him is too high. It's better to secure the sale with John and avoid any potential losses."
