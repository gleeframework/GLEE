"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, you know you have another option with John. Since John is willing to sell the product for your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you may be able to get her to lower the price closer to her value of $1,200,000."
