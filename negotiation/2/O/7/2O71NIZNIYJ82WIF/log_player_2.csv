"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, so you'd be getting a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I'll be selling it to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000.  There's a chance you could negotiate a better price with Alice or she might lower her price if you initially decline."
