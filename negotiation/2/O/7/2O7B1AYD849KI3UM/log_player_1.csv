Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I'm still making a profit of $2,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so he has room to negotiate. 

This initial offer gives me a good starting point for negotiations and allows me to potentially earn more than the $10,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above the price John is willing to pay, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $11,500. This is still a significant profit for me, but it also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept, but if not, we can continue negotiating until we reach a mutually agreeable price."
