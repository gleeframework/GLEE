"Thank you for your offer Alice.  $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to my business.",13500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $13,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us, considering the value it brings to your business.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14,500, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $15,200. This is a fair price that still reflects the value the product brings to your business.",15200.0,Alice,5,
