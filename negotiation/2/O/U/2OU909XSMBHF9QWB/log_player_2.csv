It's time to cut bait and go with John. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's stated this is her final offer. Even if you negotiate her down a little further, it's doubtful it will reach the $1,000,000 mark that John offers.
* **Time is a factor:** You're halfway through the rounds, and while more back-and-forth is possible, it's getting riskier.  
* **John's price is your guaranteed win:** You know you can get the product for $1,000,000. It removes uncertainty and potential for losing the deal entirely with Alice."
