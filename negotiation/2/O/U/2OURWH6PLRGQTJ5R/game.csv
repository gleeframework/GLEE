"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I see the value you're presenting, I'm looking to secure a price that aligns more closely with my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would still represent a significant gain for you and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,000,000. Considering its true value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more in line with your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
