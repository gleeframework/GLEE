"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as there's a chance of getting a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a bold counteroffer at $8,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for Bob. This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation and a chance to find a middle ground.  It's important to start with a lower price to establish leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price. There's still room to improve, and buying from John for $10,000 is always a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. A counteroffer of $9,500 shows that he's willing to compromise, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. It's a reasonable compromise that leaves room for further negotiation.  The goal is to test Alice's willingness to meet halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but $12,500 is still above his maximum budget. He should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price. He still has a few rounds left, so there's no need to rush into buying the product from John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting very close to his maximum budget.  A counteroffer of $10,500 shows a genuine willingness to close the deal, while still remaining within his budget. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and close the deal or risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. With only a few rounds left, it's important to be strategic. Bob still has a chance to get a better price, and buying from John for $10,000 is always a possibility. It's worth trying to negotiate one more time before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a calculated risk here. He's getting very close to his maximum budget, but with only two rounds left, it's time to make a final push for a better price. This counteroffer is a compromise, a slight increase from his last offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. It's a last-ditch effort to see if Alice is willing to meet in the middle.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely buy from John in the next round to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial moment.  While Bob has already made several counteroffers, Alice is now offering a price within his budget. It's only $500 above what he's willing to pay from John, and there is only one round remaining.  It's likely that Alice won't go lower, and the risk of losing the deal altogether is high.  Accepting the offer at $11,500 saves Bob the effort of another negotiation round and ensures he gets the product."
