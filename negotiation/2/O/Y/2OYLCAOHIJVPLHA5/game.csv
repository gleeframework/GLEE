"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
