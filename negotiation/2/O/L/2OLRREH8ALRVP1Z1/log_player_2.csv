It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is the same price John is offering. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as it's unlikely Alice will go lower."
