Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product between $80 and $150 allows for profit. By starting at $130, we aim for a significant profit margin. If Bob rejects this offer, we can always sell to John for our minimum acceptable price."
