"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,300. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price?",9300.0,Bob,6,
