"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $11,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll offer you a compromise at $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
