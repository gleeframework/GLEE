Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** While not my ideal price, it's a significant profit margin.
* **Increase chances of sale:** A lower price makes it more likely Bob will accept, rather than risk losing the product to John.
* **Maintain my bottom line:** I still secure a price higher than my minimum threshold, protecting my interests."
