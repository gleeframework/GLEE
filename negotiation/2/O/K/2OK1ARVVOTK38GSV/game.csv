"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase today. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our negotiation so far.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This price is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects the true value we both see in this opportunity. Let's close this deal at this price.",10500.0,Bob,4,
