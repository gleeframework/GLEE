Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still slightly higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting close. Considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I have a backup option with John, it makes sense to accept this offer.  There's a good chance Alice won't go lower, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from her altogether."
