{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  You have a better option with John, so it's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000.  This is the best possible deal for me, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to accept it. If not, I can always buy from John."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice again. If she rejects my next offer, I'll be happy to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $900,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm serious about buying the product but still within a price range I'm comfortable with. If Alice rejects, I'll still have the option of buying from John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  Even though I'm getting closer to my limit, I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get her down to my price. If not, I'll happily buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $950,000, a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's last offer.  This shows my commitment to buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go beyond my budget. If Alice rejects, I'll move forward with buying from John."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above my budget, and I've already made several counteroffers.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to my price.  Therefore, I'll buy the product from John for $800,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
