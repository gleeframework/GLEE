"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to negotiate, and I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, I'm not comfortable with the $1,000,000 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay right now. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a fair offer that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,100,000 price point. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,180,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,120,000, which I believe is a fair price given our previous negotiations. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1120000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,190,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
