"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it for a very reasonable price. Let's start with $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,90.0
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can get a better deal.",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good value for you considering the product is worth $150. Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,85.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think $85 is the most I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,,
