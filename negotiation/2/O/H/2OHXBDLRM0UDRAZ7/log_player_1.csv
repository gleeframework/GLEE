"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price.  Bob knows the product is worth a lot to me, and I'm hoping he'll recognize the value and be willing to pay a premium.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value.  I'll counter again, but I'm getting closer to considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer before I seriously consider selling to John.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in the product and come closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk going any lower.  Bob clearly isn't willing to pay what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and walk away."
