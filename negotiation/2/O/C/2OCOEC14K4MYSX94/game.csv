"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product looks great, but $14,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I can tell this product would be a great asset for you. To be fair, $11,750 is quite low for me.  How about we make this the final offer - $12,100?",12100.0,Alice,5,
