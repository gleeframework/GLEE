{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum, we only have a few rounds left. There's a risk that we won't be able to reach an agreement, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
