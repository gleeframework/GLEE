"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product for the price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer, as it is significantly less than what it's worth to me and allows you to make a good profit as well.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much as I can.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This ensures a fairer deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want a fair deal, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product to me is simply too high to accept anything below $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll pursue other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
