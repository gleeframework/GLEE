Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this product for the price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer, as it is significantly less than what it's worth to me and allows you to make a good profit as well."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, starting with a price closer to that number might make him hesitant. Offering a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but still ensures a significant profit for Alice if accepted.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes that this offer is beneficial for both parties, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** Alice is aware that she has a guaranteed buyer in John. This knowledge gives her leverage in the negotiation, as she doesn't have to settle for anything less than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much as I can. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price. While Bob is trying to appeal to Alice's potential profit margin, Alice knows she has a guaranteed offer from John. 

It's worth continuing the negotiation for a better deal, as there's a substantial gap between Bob's offer and what Alice is willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This ensures a fairer deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice needs to signal that she's serious about getting a fair price and won't accept extremely low offers. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting a price of $1,050,000 is a common negotiation tactic, aiming to find a compromise. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Alice still holds a strong position knowing John's offer is available.  She's willing to walk away if Bob doesn't move closer to a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want a fair deal, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to a million, Alice knows she has a guaranteed offer for $1,500,000 from John. It's still beneficial to continue negotiating, as there's a significant difference between Bob's offer and her ideal selling price. Alice can afford to be a little bolder in her next counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product to me is simply too high to accept anything below $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If it doesn't work for you, I understand, and I'll pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Firm Boundary:** By stating this is her final offer, Alice creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes she's serious about the $1,000,000 mark.
* **Final Compromise:** Offering $1,000,000 is a significant concession from Alice's initial offers and her minimum acceptable price. It shows she's willing to compromise but not be taken advantage of. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  Alice reiterates her willingness to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't meet her price. This reinforces her strong position and the value she places on the product."
