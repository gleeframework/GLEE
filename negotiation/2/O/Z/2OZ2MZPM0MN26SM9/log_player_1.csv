"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $90 is too low for me, and I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to push the price up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm counteroffering at $100. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm going to try to get as close to $100 as possible. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John and walk away with $120."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've made several counteroffers and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, so I'm ending negotiations with Bob."
