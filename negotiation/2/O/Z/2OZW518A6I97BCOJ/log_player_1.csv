Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}"
