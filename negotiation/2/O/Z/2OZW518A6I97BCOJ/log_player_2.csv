"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's initial offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $875,000 is significantly lower than $1,000,000.
* **Limited negotiation room:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will dig in her heels and refuse to budge further.  It's likely that she's already reached her minimum acceptable price.
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation would take time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome.

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal and saves a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
