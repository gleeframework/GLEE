"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while also considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

It's still worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. You are closer to your target price, and there are still rounds left to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would give you a good profit margin while allowing me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your position. While $1,120,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched. Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to offer $1,105,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1105000}
