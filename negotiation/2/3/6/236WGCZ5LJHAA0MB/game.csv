"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while also considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This would give you a good profit margin while allowing me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position. While $1,120,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched. Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm willing to offer $1,105,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I believe it allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this agreement.",1105000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, Bob, but I've already given you a good amount of room for negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can close the deal at this price.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
