"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $100. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about $105? Let's meet in the middle.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, which would be $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
