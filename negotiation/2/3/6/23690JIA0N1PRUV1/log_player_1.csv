"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counteroffer. I also have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a profit.  I'm confident that Bob will be motivated to make a deal since he's already shown interest."
