"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking this is a great fit for me. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for a price closer to $130. If you're serious about selling it to me, let's find a middle ground there.",130.0,Bob,4,
