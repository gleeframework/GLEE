"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product for my business. However, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product can bring to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? I believe this would be a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work together to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me.",11750.0,Alice,5,
