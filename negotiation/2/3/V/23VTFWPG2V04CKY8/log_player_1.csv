{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to be friendly and open to Bob's perspective to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, considering your interest in the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $85.  That's a significant discount from my original price, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway again, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the discount to make the offer more appealing and showing I'm willing to compromise."
