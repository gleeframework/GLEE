"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $850,000. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you be open to meeting me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  $750,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, and it's a great price considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
