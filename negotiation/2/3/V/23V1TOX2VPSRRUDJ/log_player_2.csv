"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1750000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it has the potential to generate significant returns. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer might be a good deal for her, it's not the best deal for Bob.  He can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, which is a better price."
