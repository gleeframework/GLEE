Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $140. I think you'll find it's a great value at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's value is $100, we start with a price closer to our minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a discount ($10 off) makes it seem like we've considered Bob's perspective and are offering a good deal.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** The price is still attractive to us because it's more than Bob values it for, but less than what John is willing to pay. This gives us a good chance of a sale.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. We might need to adjust our price depending on Bob's response."
