Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to  $800,000. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is far too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get a reasonable price for my product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is still below my minimum, it's getting closer. I'll reject the offer and see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we compromise at $1,150,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
