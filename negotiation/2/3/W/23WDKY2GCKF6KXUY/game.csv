"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to  $800,000. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is far too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get a reasonable price for my product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,000,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we compromise at $1,150,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
