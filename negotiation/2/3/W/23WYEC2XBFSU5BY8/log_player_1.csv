"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer,  aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm going to drop my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a good price. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to sell to him at this point. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price."
