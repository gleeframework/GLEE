Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer.  I'll try to counter Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $850,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the potential value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the potential value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is significantly closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000 and only $50,000 away from my ideal deal. Given the limited rounds and the fact that John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most financially beneficial option."
