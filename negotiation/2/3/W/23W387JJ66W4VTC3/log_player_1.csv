**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is offering $1,500,000, which is the same amount John is offering.  While we could try to negotiate Bob up further, there's no guarantee of success and we risk him lowering his offer. It's in our best interest to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and move on."
