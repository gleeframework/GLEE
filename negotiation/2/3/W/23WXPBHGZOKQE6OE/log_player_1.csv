Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this offer represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's worth to John ($1,500,000) is her absolute minimum. She starts high to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can still likely secure a price higher than $1,500,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential benefits"" to entice Bob and justify the high price. 
* **Direct and Open:** The message encourages a response and further discussion, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Note:** While aiming high, Alice must be careful not to price herself out of Bob's range entirely. A wildly unrealistic price might discourage Bob from even engaging in negotiations."
