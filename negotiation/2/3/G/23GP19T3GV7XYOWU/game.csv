"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000 for this product. That's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you the product for $1275000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1275000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $1000000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price.
