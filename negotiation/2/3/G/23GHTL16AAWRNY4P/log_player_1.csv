Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm willing to go a bit higher than my last offer. Would you consider $9,750? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach my $10,500 offer.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
