"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value this product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $11,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $9,500? I think that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I value your interest in the product and want to make this work. How about we settle at $10,500? This offer reflects a minimal concession on my end, acknowledging the value you see in the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
