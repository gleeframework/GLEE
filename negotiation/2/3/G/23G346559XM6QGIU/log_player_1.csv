Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  For a deal to happen, the price needs to be between $1,200,001 (so Bob profits) and $1,499,999 (so you profit more than selling to John).

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **""Exclusive opportunity""** adds a touch of desirability.
* **""Unique value and potential""** subtly reinforces the product's worth.
* **$1,450,000** is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down while staying well above your minimum.

**Important Notes**

* **Be prepared to negotiate.** Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Be confident and professional** throughout the negotiation.

Let me know if you'd like to explore other offer strategies or if Bob responds with a counter-offer!"
