"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, your offer is considerably below its true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the product's genuine worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of your product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer is still not financially feasible for me. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal. If you agree to $1,600,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a big stretch for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000.  This shows my commitment to getting this deal done.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
