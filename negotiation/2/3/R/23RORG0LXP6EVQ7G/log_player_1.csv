Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I believe it would be highly valuable for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible while staying above her minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This eliminates the risk of going lower and potentially losing profit."
