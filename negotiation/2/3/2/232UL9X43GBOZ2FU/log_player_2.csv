``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Although it's still more than he initially hoped to pay, it's a reasonable price and it's getting closer to his target.  He risks losing a good deal if he keeps negotiating and Alice changes her mind.  It's also important to remember that he can always buy from John for $8,000 if he decides he wants to walk away."
