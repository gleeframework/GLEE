"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $775000. Can you consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $812500. This is a reasonable price that should be more in line with your budget.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $812500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $775000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made several concessions already, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and it's still a great deal considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,7,
