"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This aligns with my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  While I value your interest, the product's worth to me is quite high.  I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting its value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still outside of my comfortable range. To move forward, I can offer $1,150,000. This price reflects a compromise on both our ends, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,
