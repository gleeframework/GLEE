# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-negotiation and potentially get a better price.  While you could buy from John, the goal is to save money, and negotiating with Alice offers that possibility."

While $1,350,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you are willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get an even lower price."
