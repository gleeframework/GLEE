Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford $13,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $11,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position on the price. However, considering my budget constraints, could we possibly negotiate down to $9,500? I believe this would still provide a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we have a guaranteed offer for $10,000 from John. It makes the most financial sense to sell to John at this point."
