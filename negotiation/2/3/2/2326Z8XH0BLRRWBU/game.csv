"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't afford $13,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $11,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
