"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. Would you like to buy it from me for $12000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. Would you consider $11500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. This is my final offer. If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11500, but I'll throw in some additional support and training to sweeten the deal?",11500.0,Alice,5,
