"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $11,500? This is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
