"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price reflects the product's value, but I need to consider my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900000 is closer to my asking price, it still doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm offering $1000000 as my final counteroffer. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
