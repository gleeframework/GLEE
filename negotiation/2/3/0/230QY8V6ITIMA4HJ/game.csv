,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, but $1,300,000 is the absolute maximum I can go right now. I believe this is a fair price considering your value, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
