"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,500. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $11,000. How about we try $13,000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle if you're willing to meet me halfway.",13000.0,Alice,5,
