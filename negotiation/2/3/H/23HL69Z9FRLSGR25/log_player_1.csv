{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $950,000, which is still lower than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing it as a fair price considering its value to Bob. This might encourage him to accept or counter with a reasonable offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to respond, showing I'm willing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm trying to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a deal with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always go back to John, but I'd rather try to get closer to my minimum with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for better negotiation:** There's room for further negotiation with Bob. I can try to meet him halfway or find a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **John as backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup option gives me the leverage to be more assertive in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $900,000? This would give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering $900,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that $900,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Open to compromise:** I'm using language like ""let's see if we can find a compromise"" to keep the door open for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's but still above my minimum, I'm increasing the likelihood of a deal while maintaining my bargaining position. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can then either make another counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $875,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **John as backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup option allows me to be firm in my negotiation with Bob. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my target price.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll try to find a compromise that is closer to my desired price but still appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm still a bit too high at $875,000.  How about we meet at $925,000? This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering $925,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's offer of $875,000. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair compromise and closer to what I need.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using language like ""let's see if we can finalize this deal"" to signal that I'm ready to close the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a step closer to Bob's price, but it still keeps me within my preferred range. I'm hoping that Bob will recognize this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer, avoiding further negotiation and allowing me to earn more. If Bob rejects, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, but my goal is to secure a deal with Bob."
