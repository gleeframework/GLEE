Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for a great product like this.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $75 yet. How about we meet at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further.  It's better to secure the product from John at $80 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse deal."
