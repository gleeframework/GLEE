"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $13,000? That's a fair offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I can do $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is a very nice product and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,250. I can do $13,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",13750.0,Alice,7,
