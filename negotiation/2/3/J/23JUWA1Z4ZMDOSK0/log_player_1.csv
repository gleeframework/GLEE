Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've already received, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher price ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to maximize profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high demand and value without explicitly stating a reason for the price. This can pique Bob's interest and make him more receptive to negotiating.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $10,000, he's unlikely to pay significantly more.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** A very high offer might make Bob disengage entirely. You need to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a deal."
