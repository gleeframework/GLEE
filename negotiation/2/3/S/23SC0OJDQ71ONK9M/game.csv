"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1300000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this stage.  Considering the product's value to you, I'd be interested in making an offer of $1150000. This price reflects the value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1225000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. While I'm interested, $1225000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1187500? This would still provide you with a healthy profit, while remaining within my budget.",1187500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1187500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'll offer you the product for $1210000. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1210000.0,Alice,5,
