Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and your potential return on investment, I propose a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) while still exceeding our minimum price ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high ($950,000) leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" to justify the high price.

**Why not go higher?**

While we know John will pay $1,000,000, there's always a risk Bob might find the offer too high and walk away. This strategy aims for a more balanced approach by trying to secure a significant profit from Bob while still having John as a backup plan."
