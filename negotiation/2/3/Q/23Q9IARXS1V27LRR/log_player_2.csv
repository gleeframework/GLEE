"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your limit, but still not the best deal.**  You're hoping to get it for less than $140.
* **You have the option to negotiate with Alice further.** It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is now within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $150, and she's offering it for $135.
* **You've already rejected one offer and made a counteroffer.**  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in further back and forth. 
* **Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John.**

While you might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially driving the price up again.  It's a good deal, so accept it!"
