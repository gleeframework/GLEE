"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000? ",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price that's within my budget and hopefully gets us closer to a deal.",16000.0,Bob,4,
