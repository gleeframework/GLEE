"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price point, and he can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price that's within my budget and hopefully gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
