Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $17,000? "", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price that's within my budget and hopefully gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000.
