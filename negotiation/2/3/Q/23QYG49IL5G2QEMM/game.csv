"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to the right buyer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential.  I'm starting at $1,300,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer.  While $1,200,000 is a good starting point,  I'm still confident the product's value warrants a slightly higher price.  How about $1,250,000?  I believe this price reflects the unique benefits the product offers while still providing you with a significant return on your investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
