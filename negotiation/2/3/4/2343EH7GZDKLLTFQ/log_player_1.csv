"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. This product offers unique features that you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this product has great features, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I could go. If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to budge much beyond his $10,000 offer. While we could counteroffer, we risk him walking away entirely. Accepting his offer at $10,000 is a $5,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $15,000. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
