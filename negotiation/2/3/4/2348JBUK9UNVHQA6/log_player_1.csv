"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $900,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still getting a profit. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to come close to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept less than $800,000 for this product. I'll keep trying to negotiate with him, but I'm getting closer to just selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $825,000.  This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, but it's getting closer to Bob's value and I'm hoping he'll accept.  If he doesn't, I might just sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of time. It's time to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John and move on."
