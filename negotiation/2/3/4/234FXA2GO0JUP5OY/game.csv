"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer the product to you for $13000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $12500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",12500.0,Alice,5,
