Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.
