"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but my max budget is $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for the product. Can you consider a price of $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget and the value of the product to you. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is your top limit, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product. This adds significant value to the deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
