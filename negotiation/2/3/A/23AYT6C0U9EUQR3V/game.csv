"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the value it can bring to you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a product of this value, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, I believe the product's inherent worth warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,900,000. This price reflects the value it holds and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it will bring to me, while also showing that I'm willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price. Let's make this simple - $1,825,000 and we have a deal. This offer splits the difference between our previous positions and reflects the product's true value.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,825,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,775,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value the product will bring to me, and I'm willing to make a final offer at this level. If you're willing to meet me here, I'm willing to make a deal.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
