"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $115 is within his budget, it's not the best possible price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within his budget. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his ideal.  He can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  There are still multiple rounds left, so rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, offering a price that is closer to his ideal but still slightly higher than his initial counteroffer.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to find a middle ground.  It also keeps the negotiation moving forward towards a potential agreement."
