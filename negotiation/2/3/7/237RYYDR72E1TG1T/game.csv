"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,400,000? This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, that's closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to do $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is still significantly lower than the value I'm placing on this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This would be a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
