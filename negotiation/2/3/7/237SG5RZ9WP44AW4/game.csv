"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that high. Given my budget constraints, I can offer $1250000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1250000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1325000? This price allows both of us to make a reasonable profit and move forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1325000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I can afford. Let's try $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us. What do you say?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
