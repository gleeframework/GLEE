"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 at this point.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that we're both trying to reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  What do you say?",9750.0,Bob,6,
