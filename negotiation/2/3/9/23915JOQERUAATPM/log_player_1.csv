Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for potential negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for me to potentially earn more than my minimum of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for a product like this. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 100}
