"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its potential and am open to discussing it further."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly suggesting the price is justified. This avoids anchoring solely on Bob's perceived value.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling flexibility without making significant concessions yet.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This high initial offer gives me leverage in later rounds and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a significant move towards my desired range, accepting it now leaves potential profit on the table.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to demonstrate that I'm also seeking a strong outcome. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation active and allows me to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to the mark, the value this product brings is truly unique.  To meet somewhere in the middle, I'd be willing to let it go for $2,000,000.  This is my best offer and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's engagement in the negotiation and using language that suggests I'm willing to make a deal.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my asking price by a significant amount ($250,000), but not so much that I appear desperate or undervalue the product.
* **Anchoring:** By presenting $2,000,000 as my ""best offer,"" I'm hoping to anchor Bob's expectations closer to my desired price point. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** While not explicitly stated, framing this as my ""best offer"" subtly introduces a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly if he wants the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating genuine interest and reaching a price point where further negotiation might yield diminishing returns.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations or Bob walking away. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and a successful outcome."
