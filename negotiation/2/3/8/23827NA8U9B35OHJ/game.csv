"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to your company.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000.  This is a price that reflects its worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1050000.0,Alice,1,
