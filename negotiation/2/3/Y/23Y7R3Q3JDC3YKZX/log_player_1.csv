I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower offer.  I'm confident in the value of my product, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than $10,000 from John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

```

Bob is not budging from his $12,000 offer, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him. It's time to accept his offer.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
