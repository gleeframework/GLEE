{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Space for Negotiation:** This offer gives Bob the opportunity to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.  
* **Avoiding the John Option:** This price is still above my minimum threshold, so I'm not forced to sell to John immediately. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll consider lowering the price slightly but will not go below $10,000. If he counters, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter with my own offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower than My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold of $15,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  There's a chance I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **No Urgency to Sell to John:**  Since I have a potential buyer in Bob, I'm not under pressure to sell to John immediately.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my ideal $12,000 mark. I'll be willing to negotiate but will not go below $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $11,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000, ensuring I'm not losing too much money.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Power:** This counteroffer still leaves room for further negotiation, allowing me to potentially achieve a price closer to my ideal $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll be happy to finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll consider whether to lower my price further or stick to my $11,000 offer. I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I feel it's necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose $9,500 as my offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher offer from Bob, but the likelihood of reaching my desired price range is low. 
* **John Offers a Better Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a quick and hassle-free transaction.

**Next Steps:**

I'll immediately contact John and finalize the sale, maximizing my profit and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
