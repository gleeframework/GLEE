{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has immense potential for your company. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects its significant value and the potential benefits it holds for you. I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:**  $1,150,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Provides justification:**  The message highlights the product's value and potential for Bob, making the offer more compelling.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Keeps John as an option:** This creates a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1150000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Negotiate further:**  You can potentially push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Test Bob's limits:**  Seeing if he's willing to go higher might reveal how much he truly values the product.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting the offer shows you're not desperate for a sale, potentially making Bob more willing to compromise.

**Important note:** If the negotiation with Bob drags on, selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option, ensuring you don't lose out completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my final offer, considering your budget limitations. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:**  Dropping to $1,100,000 is a significant compromise, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforce product value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, making the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Finality:**  Calling it your ""final offer"" creates pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Balance:**  This counteroffer balances the need for profit with the need to potentially close the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  While $1,075,000 isn't your ideal price, it's only $25,000 below your minimum, which is a small margin.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, potentially forcing you to sell to John for a lower amount.
* **Time consideration:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further delays.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a profit that's close to your minimum, minimizing risk and ensuring a swift transaction."
