"Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial.  I'm asking for $2,300,000 for it. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and coming back with a proposal.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its real value. How about we meet halfway at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,000,000 if possible.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this conversation. I appreciate you moving up on the price, but we're still quite a ways apart. While I am committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I do have another interested buyer at a significantly higher price point.  To be completely transparent, I'd prefer to make this deal work with you.  How about we meet at $1,500,000, and we can finalize everything today?",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and the value of the product. However, I am still not able to meet the price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 if possible.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
