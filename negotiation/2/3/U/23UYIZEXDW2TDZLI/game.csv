"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $100, but $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's try $115. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $112? That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $120.",112.0,Bob,6,
