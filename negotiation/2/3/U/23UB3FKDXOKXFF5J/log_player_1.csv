{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This will allow me to potentially negotiate a higher price if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at that price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price.  I'm not going to settle for the minimum right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! While I'm happy to negotiate, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've already rejected Bob's initial offer of $80 and made a counteroffer of $90. He's now offered $85, which is closer to my desired price and still higher than my minimum. It's a good compromise and I'm willing to accept it."
