"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",9800.0,Bob,4,
