"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still above your desired price point of $1,500,000.  Since you have 10 rounds and Alice is seemingly open to negotiation (mentioning the product's potential worth exceeding the asking price), it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,350,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still above your $1,500,000 limit. You have several rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still pushing to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can make this work at $1,375,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to close this purchase."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
