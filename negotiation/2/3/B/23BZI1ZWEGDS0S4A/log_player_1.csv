"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product might be worth even more to Bob, justifying the high price without revealing our own minimum.
* **Open Communication:** We end with an open question to encourage Bob's engagement and understand his perspective. 

The goal is to anchor Bob's expectations high while leaving room for negotiation and gauging his initial reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is a tempting offer, we still have room to negotiate and Bob's initial rejection suggests he might be willing to go higher.  We're aiming for a win-win, but not at the cost of leaving a significant sum on the table.  We'll counter in the next round to try and find a more favorable middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,350,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:**  We're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not without emphasizing that our price is fair and justified.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic creates a sense of compromise and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Positive Framing:** We're reiterating that this deal benefits both parties, fostering goodwill and encouraging agreement.

We're aiming to signal a willingness to negotiate while holding firm to a price point closer to our initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still pushing to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can make this work at $1,375,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to close this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly committed to the purchase and has steadily increased his offer.  $1,375,000 is a strong price, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a substantially better outcome, and we risk pushing Bob away entirely. Accepting now secures a very favorable deal."
