Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation. I believe this offer is aggressive enough to push Bob to negotiate but not so high that he immediately rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,600,000.  This is still a good price for me and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to accept.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both agree on a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that he will reject my counteroffer and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to accept Bob's offer and secure the deal."
