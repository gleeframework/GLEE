Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's more than Bob's valuation but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'll see if he's willing to pay this price, or if he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give it away for a price that's so low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to his offer but still above his valuation. Hopefully, this will be enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my valuation and I'm not sure how much more we can negotiate.  Selling to John guarantees $12,000 but there's a risk that Bob will counter-offer again with a lower price and I might end up with less than $9,200."
