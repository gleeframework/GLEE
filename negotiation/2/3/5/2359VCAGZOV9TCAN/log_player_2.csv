"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start lower than Alice's offer to encourage negotiation.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $9,500 is a significant drop from Alice's $11,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Open to Discussion:** Bob's message is friendly and leaves the door open for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. How about we meet halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is a better deal than $12,000, there's still a bit of wiggle room.  Alice is willing to negotiate, and Bob can likely get a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob's counteroffer is a compromise, showing his willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Final Offer (Maybe):**  $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but it might be his final offer. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** The message emphasizes a desire for a fair agreement."
