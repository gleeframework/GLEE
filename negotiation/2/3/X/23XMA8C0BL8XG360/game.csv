"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This price still allows for a significant profit margin for you and ensures we both walk away satisfied. Let's find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the benefits this product can bring to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than the value this product will bring to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential for growth. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $975,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market conditions and the value this product can bring to my business.",975000.0,Bob,6,
