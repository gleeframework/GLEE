,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not viable for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,000,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that we need to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $900,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good price for a valuable product. ",900000.0,Alice,5,
