Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure, especially considering its long-term potential.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 1800000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's offer.  It's time to move on."
