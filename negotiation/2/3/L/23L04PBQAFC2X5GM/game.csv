"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds that figure, especially considering its long-term potential.  I could consider a price of $1,800,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my willingness to negotiate.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,800,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
