# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product which has been valued at $1,500,000 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I am offering it to you today for an exclusive price of $1,200,000. This is a special opportunity to own this product at a significant discount, so I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* You can potentially save more money by negotiating with Alice. 
* While buying from John is an option, it's not the most cost-effective choice at this point."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle.
