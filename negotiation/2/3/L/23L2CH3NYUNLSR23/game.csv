"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a quality product at a price below its value, and I still get a good return on my investment. What do you say? ",9500.0,Alice,1,
