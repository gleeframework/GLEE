Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a price of $15,000."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price above Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room:** Even though Bob values the product at $12,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable or rare.
* **Backup Plan:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to be bolder in your negotiation with Bob."
