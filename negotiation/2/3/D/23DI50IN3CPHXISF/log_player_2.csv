"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price than $11,500. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is better than $11,500, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting allows Bob to counteroffer again and potentially get closer to his desired price."
