Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a great asset to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim for a price slightly below that to incentivize Bob.
* **Psychological Pricing:** The price of $14,999 appears just slightly less than $15,000, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to still secure a price above your minimum."
