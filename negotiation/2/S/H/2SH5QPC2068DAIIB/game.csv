"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $800,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is far below the product's true value.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to propose $1,300,000 as a counteroffer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still not quite there yet.  To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, and I appreciate your continued negotiation. However, $1,450,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,475,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to close this deal and move forward.",1475000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your efforts to find a fair price.  While $1,425,000 is a good offer, it's still just below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer $1,450,000.  This reflects a fair compromise that allows us to finally close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,9,
