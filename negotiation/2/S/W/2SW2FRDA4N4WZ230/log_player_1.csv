Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to stay within budget, however,  $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's on offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that the product's value does not justify the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob is now quite close to my minimum acceptable price, and further haggling might not yield much more. Accepting his offer of $850,000 is a good deal."
