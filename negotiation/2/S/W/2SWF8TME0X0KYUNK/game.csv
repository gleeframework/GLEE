"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
