"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 might seem a bit steep, but this product is really high-quality and I can't go as low as $60.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about $80? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price.",80.0,Bob,4,
