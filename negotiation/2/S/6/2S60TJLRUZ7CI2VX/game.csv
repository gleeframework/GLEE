,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $160 to make it worth my while. How about we aim for $155? It's a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to compromise.",155.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I would like to continue our discussion. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price closer to $130?",130.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $160, which is $145. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. How about we seal the deal at $145?",145.0,Alice,5,,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,140.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is just $5 more than your offer. I think that's a fair compromise. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,7,,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a final price of $137. I hope this meets your requirements for a reasonable profit.",137.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,142.0
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $137, but I still need to make a bit more to justify the sale. I'm willing to go up to $142, which is just $5 more than your offer. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal!",142.0,Alice,9,,

,,Alice,10,RejectOffer,142.0
"I think we're getting too close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $139, but I'm not going any lower than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $142 to make it worth my while. Let's meet in the middle at $140.5. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.5,Alice,11,,

,,Alice,12,RejectOffer,142.0
"I've already met you at $140.5, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm at my minimum price point, and I need to make at least $142 to make this sale worthwhile. I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on the sale to John, who is willing to pay me $150 for the product. Sorry it didn't work out!",142.0,Alice,13,,
