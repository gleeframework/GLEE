"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This means you'll save $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Buying from John is your fallback:** You know you can always buy from John for $1,200,000, so you're not taking a big risk by accepting Alice's offer."
