"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  It's my final offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However,  $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $12,000. If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
