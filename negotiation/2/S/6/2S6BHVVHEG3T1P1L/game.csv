"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of this asset. To be candid, my original pricing reflects the significant potential I see for you with this acquisition. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,900,000? I believe this price point represents a fair balance given the unique benefits this asset brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
