"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This is to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. It also sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject and try to push for a higher value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter with $975,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still believe the product is worth more. It's a smaller jump from his offer, aiming to signal a willingness to close the deal while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is now lower than my last counteroffer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. It's only Round 4, and I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'm going to try to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

Since Bob's offer is now lower, I'm going to meet him in the middle and offer $950,000. This is a compromise but still allows me to secure a profitable sale. It's also worth considering that we're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. There are still a few rounds left, and I'd like to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm going to reject and counter again, aiming to stay closer to my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000. We're getting closer to a possible agreement, and this price is a good balance between what I want and what Bob seems willing to offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm still not ready to settle. We have two rounds left, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'll reject and counter once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise that bridges the gap between Bob's last offer and my desired price.  Since it's our final round of negotiation with Bob, I'm pushing for a higher price while still leaving room for potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to choose to sell to John.  While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I've pushed hard in negotiations and haven't been able to secure a better deal. It's better to secure a guaranteed $800,000 than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
