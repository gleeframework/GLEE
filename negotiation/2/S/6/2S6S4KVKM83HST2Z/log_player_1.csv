"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds significant value. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it.  It's a price that reflects the product's potential, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  My message emphasizes the potential value of the product, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating I'm ""open to discussing it further,"" I'm signaling flexibility and a willingness to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the product's potential value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value Potential:**  While Bob's offer is respectable, I believe the product has the potential to fetch a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Ten Rounds:**  I have ten rounds to work with, so rejecting Bob's first counteroffer gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget constraints,  $1,200,000 doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from the initial offer, but not by too much.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob why it's worth investing in.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  I emphasize that this price is a win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but there's still room for improvement. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  By rejecting his offer, I can keep pushing for a higher price and potentially secure a better deal in the next round.
* **Time Remaining:** With eight rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your persistence, $1,300,000 still falls short of the value I know this product holds.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $1,350,000. This price reflects both our needs and the product's potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Agreement:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway by lowering my price again.
* **Finality:**  By mentioning ""splitting the difference,"" I subtly suggest this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I reframe the price as reflecting ""both our needs,"" aiming for a more cooperative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Respectfully, Alice, I believe we should aim for a more equitable exchange. Based on my assessment and considering the negotiation thus far, I propose a counteroffer of $1325000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is very close to my previous counteroffer of $1,350,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Continuing to reject offers could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential Loss:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit. It's more advantageous than selling to John for $1,000,000."
