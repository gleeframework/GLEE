Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm not willing to go down to $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good deal for Bob. He values the product at $12,000 and can get it for $9,000, saving him $3,000. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially increasing the price, or even withdrawing her offer altogether, makes accepting this offer the best choice."
