"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the value I see in this product for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
