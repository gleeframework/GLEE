Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately triggering a sale to John.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open and allowing for potential adjustments based on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **There is still room for negotiation.** I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, potentially reaching a compromise.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have the opportunity to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is still a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects the value I see in this product for you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but still engaging in negotiation.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  My counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maintaining my desired price and keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** 
* **Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result.** While there's potential for more negotiation, the gap between our desired prices is considerable.  

Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is far more advantageous than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
