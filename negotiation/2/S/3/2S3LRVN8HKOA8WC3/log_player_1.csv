Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or would like to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and provide insight into his perceived value of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the safety net of John's offer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you a strong position to walk away if the negotiation doesn't meet your expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Based on my assessment, I am willing to pay $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay slightly more, especially since he initiated a counteroffer. By rejecting and providing a counteroffer, I can test his upper limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I believe the product's worth is closer to my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway at $13,250?"", ""product_price"": 13250}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By coming down from $14,500 to $13,250, you're demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Midpoint:**  This offer positions itself directly between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it appear like a fair compromise. 
* **Maintaining Profit:** The $13,250 price point still provides a substantial profit margin above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your response. After careful consideration, I am willing to increase my offer to $12,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has incrementally increased his offer, and at $12,750, it's a reasonable profit above my minimum of $12,000. Further haggling might risk losing the sale altogether, and the current offer provides a good balance between profit and deal closure."
