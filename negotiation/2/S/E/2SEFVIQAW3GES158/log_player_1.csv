Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $720,000 is lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.
