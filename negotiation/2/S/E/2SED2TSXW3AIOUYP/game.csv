"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price closer to the middle ground. How about $900,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is better, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $800,000 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",800000.0,Alice,5,
