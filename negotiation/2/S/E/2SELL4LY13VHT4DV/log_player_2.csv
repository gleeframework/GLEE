"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is cheaper than her product's value to her, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You can save $25 by rejecting Alice's offer."
