"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum price of $100. It's worth rejecting and starting negotiations. You have 10 rounds, so there's plenty of room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum price point, making it clear I'm serious about buying but also setting a firm boundary. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like I'm lowballing her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price closer to my target. It's worth a few more rounds of negotiation before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my means. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway, hopefully increasing the likelihood of a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $125 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $137.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target price, it's still above my maximum of $100. I'm not desperate to buy the product, and John is offering a much better deal. I'll continue negotiating with Alice for a few more rounds but keep John's offer in mind. There's still potential to reach a deal with Alice without overspending."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $120. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking with my strategy of incrementally moving towards Alice's price. Offering $120 shows that I'm still negotiating but also that I have a firm upper limit. This keeps the pressure on Alice to consider a compromise. If she rejects this, I'll have to weigh the possibility of buying from John."
