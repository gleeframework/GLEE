Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my means. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for that low.  I'll counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $125 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $137.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $120. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $120 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm running out of rounds. I'm going to sell to John, as it's the most financially beneficial option at this point."
