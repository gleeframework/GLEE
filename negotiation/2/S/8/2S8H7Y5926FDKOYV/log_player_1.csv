{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to accept. If he rejects, I'm ready to counter and ultimately, if necessary, sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's first offer, it's still below my floor. I'll make a counteroffer and try to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find the best price.  $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about $8,750?  I'm very serious about buying the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my floor price, $8,750 is still below my minimum. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
