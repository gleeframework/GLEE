"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find the best price.  $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  Let's try to make this work.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about $8,750?  I'm very serious about buying the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to go a little lower.  $9,000 is my final offer. It's a great price for a great product. If you're serious about buying it, let's make this deal happen.",9000.0,Alice,5,
