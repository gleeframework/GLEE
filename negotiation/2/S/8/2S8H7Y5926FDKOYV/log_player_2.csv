You can do better than $10,000. You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to find the best price.  $8,500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You can still do better than $9,250. Reject Alice's offer and try to get a price closer to your target of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,250 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. How about $8,750?  I'm very serious about buying the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to go a little lower.  $9,000 is my final offer. It's a great price for a great product. If you're serious about buying it, let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

At this point, it's clear Alice is unlikely to go much lower. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so that's the best option."
