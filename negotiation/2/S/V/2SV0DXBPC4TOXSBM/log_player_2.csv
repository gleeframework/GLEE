Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000.  This price is a significant compromise from my initial position, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!
