"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the immense value it holds. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a significant investment for me.  I believe this price reflects the value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see your willingness to invest in this product. However, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it also allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work towards a resolution.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,250,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000.  This price is a significant compromise from my initial position, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm going to offer $1,275,000 as my final offer. This price is a strong investment for me and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm going to counter with $1,290,000. This is a substantial compromise from my side, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward!",1290000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise further. However, $1,290,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,275,000. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. It's time to reach a final agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
