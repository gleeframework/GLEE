"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $90 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you.

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my minimum price. I can do $95 for the product, which is closer to my original offer. It's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $95.  Since you have a guaranteed option at $80, it's more strategic to buy from John at this point."
