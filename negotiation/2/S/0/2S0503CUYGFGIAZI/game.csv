,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  $9500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10250?  That's still a great deal for you, and gives me a bit closer to my desired price. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference again.  $10000 is fair to both of us.  It's a good price for you, and gets me closer to my goal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
