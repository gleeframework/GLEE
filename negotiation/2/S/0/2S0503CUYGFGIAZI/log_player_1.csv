Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

 I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $9,500, I'm hoping for a bit closer to my minimum of $12,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
