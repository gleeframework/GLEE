"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  You have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lower than her initial price. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway but still want to pay a price that's closer to my ideal value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is a good compromise. While it's still above my ideal price point, it's significantly lower than her initial offer and only slightly higher than my last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in minor price reductions, and I'm comfortable closing the deal at this price.  Additionally, I'm concerned that if I continue to reject offers, I may lose the opportunity to purchase the product from Alice altogether and be forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
