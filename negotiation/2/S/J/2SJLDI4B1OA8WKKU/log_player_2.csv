"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high.  You have a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer and see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and it also allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I've thought about it, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my target profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is within my budget and gives her a reasonable profit.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she could become less flexible or I could end up buying from John for a significantly higher price.  Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
