"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and it also allows you a good profit margin.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,,
