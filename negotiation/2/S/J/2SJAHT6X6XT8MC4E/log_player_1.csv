Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than my minimum value.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $14,000 is closer to my bottom line, but I can't quite go that low.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $15,500.  This way we both get a fair deal, and I can move this product along. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm running out of rounds and I need to ensure I get at least my minimum value.  Jhon is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll sell to him and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
