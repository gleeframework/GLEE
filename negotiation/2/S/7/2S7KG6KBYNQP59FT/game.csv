"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $12,500, and that's as low as I can go. This is the best deal I can offer you, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,
