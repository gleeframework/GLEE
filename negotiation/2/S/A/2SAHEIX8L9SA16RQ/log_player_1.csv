Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its true worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if Bob will bite. If he rejects, I'll gradually lower the price, keeping in mind my minimum value ($15,000) and John's offer as a fallback."
