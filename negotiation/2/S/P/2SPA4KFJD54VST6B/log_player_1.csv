Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value"" and ""worthwhile investment,""  Alice subtly reinforces the product's worth, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000.  This knowledge gives her the confidence to aim higher with Bob. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything."
