You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's still potential to negotiate a better price. You can likely secure a lower price by making a counteroffer, as Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her valuation.  This allows for room for compromise and encourages Alice to negotiate further without feeling like she's being unfairly taken advantage of."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your desired price, and you have more room to negotiate. While buying from John is always an option,  it's still worth exploring further negotiations with Alice.  There's a good chance you can get a better price than $1,100,000 by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant gap between your offer and Alice's current price. This approach encourages Alice to compromise while also maintaining your position as a serious buyer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than your initial budget and is getting closer to your counteroffers.  While there's always a chance you could negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice walking away and the opportunity cost of negotiating further make this offer a good deal. Accepting the offer allows you to secure the product at a good price, saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
