"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd love it! My initial price is $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price.  Since the maximum I'm willing to pay is $100, and Alice's initial offer is at that limit, I'll reject and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $25 reduction is a substantial move and will hopefully prompt Alice to consider a lower price. I'll adjust my strategy based on her response in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $85 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying at this stage. I'll continue to negotiate by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer in the next round.  My goal is to get as close to my $75 target as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $85 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend right now. I'm willing to go up to $80. Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating I'm serious about buying the product. However, I'm staying below Alice's last offer, showing I'm still trying to find a compromise. This gradual approach will hopefully lead to a successful negotiation within my budget."
