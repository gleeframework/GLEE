Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a price of $2,000,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification of value:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" the message subtly implies the product is worth the high price. 
* **Direct and confident tone:**  The message aims to project confidence in the product's value and encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. You can adjust your price during negotiations with Bob depending on his response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
