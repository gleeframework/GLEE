"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be a good investment, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price of $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $725,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the original offer I made.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $715,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",715000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one last offer. How about $710,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",710000.0,Alice,7,
