"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering the product for $10,000. This is your maximum price. There's no incentive to accept her offer immediately as you can get the same product from John.  By rejecting, you might get a better price from Alice or find another seller with a lower offer."
