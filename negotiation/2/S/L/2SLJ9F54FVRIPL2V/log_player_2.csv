"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement if we continue working together."", ""product_price"": 9500}
