{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,500 is higher than your minimum of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's a strong starting point:** You're showing confidence in your product and its value."
