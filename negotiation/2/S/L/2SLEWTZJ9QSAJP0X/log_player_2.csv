"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that will surely bring you great value. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still a significant amount of money. It's worth exploring if I can get a better price by negotiating.  Since I have 10 rounds, I have plenty of room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a good price, there's still room for improvement.  I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can get closer to my target price.  We still have 7 rounds left, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $1,030,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,030,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,025,000.  Considering that I have only 5 rounds left and John is asking for $1,200,000, accepting this offer is the best option for me. It's a good deal that saves me a substantial amount of money."
