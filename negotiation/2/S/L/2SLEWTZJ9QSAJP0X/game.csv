"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $1,030,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
