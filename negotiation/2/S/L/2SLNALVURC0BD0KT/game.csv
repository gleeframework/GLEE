"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
