Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
