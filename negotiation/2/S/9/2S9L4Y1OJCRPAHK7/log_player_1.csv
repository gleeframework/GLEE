"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm very interested in the product, but I have to make a smart business decision. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to try and get a better offer from Bob.  The potential of selling to John for $1,000,000 is a strong incentive to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your commitment to finding a solution, $950,000 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, and it would allow us both to walk away with a satisfactory outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $980,000 is close to what I'm hoping for, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $1,000,000.  There's a strong chance that Bob will continue to haggle, and I could end up getting less than what John will pay.  To secure the best possible outcome, it's best to accept John's offer."
