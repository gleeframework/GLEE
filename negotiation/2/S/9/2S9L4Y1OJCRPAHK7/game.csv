"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1200000. This is a significant discount from its true value. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm very interested in the product, but I have to make a smart business decision. Can we meet in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm open to negotiation, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While I value your commitment to finding a solution, $950000 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant concession, and it would allow us both to walk away with a satisfactory outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",980000.0,Bob,6,
