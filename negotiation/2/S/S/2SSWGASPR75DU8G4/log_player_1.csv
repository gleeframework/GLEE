Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a reasonable starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum price, leaving room for negotiation. It also sets a positive tone for the interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a little low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am willing to compromise further. Could we agree on $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, Bob has come up significantly in his offer.  $92 is a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by pushing too hard."
