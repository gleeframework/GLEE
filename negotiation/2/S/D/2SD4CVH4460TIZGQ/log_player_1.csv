"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's fair for both of us. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust based on his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum price of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm lowering my price to $12,000. This is a significant compromise, but still above my minimum. I hope this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, while still making a profit."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$9,500 is still below my minimum, but getting closer. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a bit more in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum and a good deal considering we've been negotiating for a while. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
