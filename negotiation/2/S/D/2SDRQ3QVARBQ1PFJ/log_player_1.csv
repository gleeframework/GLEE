"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with a price higher than your desired outcome. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a favorable price. 
* **Leave Bob Room:** Since you know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting at $20,000 leaves space for him to counteroffer without feeling insulted.
* **Project Confidence:**  By starting high, you project confidence in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly what he values the product at, which means there's likely room for negotiation. Accepting $12,000 would be settling for the absolute minimum and leaving potential profit on the table. While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, it's worth exploring if Bob will go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $20,000 is quite a ways from my bottom line.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By coming down from $20,000 to $17,000, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** While you could hold firm closer to $15,000, anchoring the price around $17,000 leaves room for further negotiation while still potentially securing a significant profit. 
* **Encourage Movement:**  By suggesting a specific price point, you encourage Bob to respond with a counteroffer rather than simply rejecting your offer outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is a solid deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** You're still making a $1,000 profit over John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation rounds and ensures you get paid promptly. 
* **Uncertain Future:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will go any higher, and holding out for a slightly better offer from him risks losing the deal altogether. 

While you could try to push for a bit more, the certainty and quick turnaround of accepting $14,000 make it the most strategic decision at this point."
