{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This way, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired $150 while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $130 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $137.50?"", ""product_price"": 137.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $137.50 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm comfortable accepting his offer and closing the deal."
