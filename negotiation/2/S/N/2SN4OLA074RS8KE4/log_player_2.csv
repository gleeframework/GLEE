"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $145.  This is more than you are willing to pay. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $145 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $137.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

While $137.50 is closer to your desired price point, it's still above your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
