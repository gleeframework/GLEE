"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in a fair price, encouraging a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I signal my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving space for a successful deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests a limited budget, it also indicates the product holds value for him. I'll reject this offer to signal the gap between his valuation and mine, prompting further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction, But Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, the new price remains well above my $1,200,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:**  The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's offer and my willingness to compromise. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer aims to assess how serious Bob is about purchasing the product and how much he's willing to budge from his initial low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need us to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $850,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, it's still significantly below my $1,200,000 walk-away point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at the risk of settling for a price that doesn't reflect the product's value. I'll use the remaining rounds to try and close the gap, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a strong alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant move on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a deal with you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Price Reduction:** I've made another substantial reduction, now just slightly above my guaranteed selling price to John. This demonstrates my strong interest in closing a deal with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** The message emphasizes this as a significant concession on my part, encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer. 
* **Urgency and Opportunity:**  By moving closer to my bottom line, I'm creating a sense of urgency, implying this might be one of the last opportunities for Bob to acquire the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but I still need this price to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer with his offer, $925,000 is still a significant difference from my $1,150,000 counteroffer.  I need to send a strong signal that I'm firm on my price and won't go much lower.  I'll reject this offer, but in the next round, I'll propose a final offer that's slightly above John's price to see if Bob is willing to make a substantial jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to make one final move.  I can let go of the product for $1,190,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a very fair offer given the product's value.  Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message explicitly states this is my final offer, conveying a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Slight Concession, Above John's Offer:** I've lowered my price slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but the price remains above John's offer, ensuring I don't lose potential profit. 
* **Clear and Direct Language:** The message is clear, concise, and leaves no room for misinterpretation, prompting a definitive response from Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still leaving me the option to accept John's offer if needed."
