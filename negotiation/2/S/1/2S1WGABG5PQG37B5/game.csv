"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I think you'll find it a great deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
