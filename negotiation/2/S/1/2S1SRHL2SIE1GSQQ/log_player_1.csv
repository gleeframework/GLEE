Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100.  It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you than that! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate, but still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
