"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
