"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $135. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to get a price closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",135.0,Alice,5,
