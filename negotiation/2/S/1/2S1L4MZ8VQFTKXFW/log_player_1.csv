Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for your product. Please let me know if this is something you can consider.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, I can only commit to $100 for your product. This is the highest I can go without compromising my financial situation. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, but I'm open to continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $135. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product and me to get a price closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Based on my budget and the value of the product, I am comfortable offering $115 for your product. I hope this aligns with your needs and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I've only got a few rounds left and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than what I can get from John."
