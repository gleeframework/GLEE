Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're willing to take $1,200,000, so this offer allows for some flexibility.
* **It shows confidence:**  A firm offer demonstrates you believe in the value of your product.

Remember, you can always adjust the price based on Bob's response.  If he rejects, you can consider lowering the price slightly, but be cautious about going too low too quickly.  You have the option of walking away and selling to John, so don't be afraid to stand your ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  You have a solid alternative with John who's willing to pay your minimum, so it makes sense to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000.  This takes into account the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is midway between your last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). It shows you're willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining your position:**  You're still above your minimum acceptable price, and it's possible to get closer to your target with further negotiation.
* **Open communication:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, keeping the negotiation friendly and open to possibilities."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your counteroffer, Alice. While I respect the value of your product, I believe we can still find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to your desired price range.  While it's still slightly below your minimum of $1,200,000, it's a good compromise and a fair deal.  It's important to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the time and effort involved.  Accepting this offer will secure a sale, and you can always try to negotiate a better price in the future if you need to sell similar products."
