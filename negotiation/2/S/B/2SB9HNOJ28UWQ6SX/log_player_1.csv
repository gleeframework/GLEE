"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if we can negotiate a higher price with him before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,150,000.  I'm still committed to paying a fair price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both some room to compromise and would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target, $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also keeping my eye on the option of selling to John for $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, I need a little more to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,112,500.  This feels fair to me, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,112,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,112,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell for $1,112,500 yet. I believe we can get closer to my desired price range with a few more rounds of negotiation."
