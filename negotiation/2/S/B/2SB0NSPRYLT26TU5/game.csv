"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. This is my maximum budget for this purchase.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a unique product, but $1200000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and your desire to sell the product.  Please let me know if this is acceptable.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your budget. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a very fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value you place on the product, $1050000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 as my final offer. This is a significant amount for me and I believe it reflects the value of the product. If you're serious about selling, I hope you'll consider accepting this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
