,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $14,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $16,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
