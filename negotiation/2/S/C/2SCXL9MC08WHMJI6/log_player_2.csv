You can definitely do better than $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,150,000 is still too high. Let's see if we can get her closer to my ideal price."

While I'd love to keep negotiating, Alice is getting closer to my ideal price. At $1,120,000, it's a good deal for both of us, and I can still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
