"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,150,000 to make it worth my while.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000?  I think that would be fair to both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need $1,120,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
