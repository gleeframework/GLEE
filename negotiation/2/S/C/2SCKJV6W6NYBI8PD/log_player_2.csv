{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 15 dollars. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down to a price I'm comfortable with."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has moved slightly closer to my price, but $85 is still a bit high. I believe there's more room for compromise, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but still leaving room for Alice to come down a bit further. This is a reasonable compromise considering my budget and Alice's previous offer."
