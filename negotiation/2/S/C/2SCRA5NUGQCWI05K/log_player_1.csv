Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product's value is higher, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

We're still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product. It's worth pushing a little further."

""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,275,000 is closer to the mark, it's still underselling the product's potential.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,310,000?  This is my final offer."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob has stated this is his final offer. Accepting at $1,290,000 is still a significant profit above our minimum, and there's a risk Bob could walk away entirely in further rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than potentially end up with John's lower offer."
