"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the product's true value is significantly higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you believe the product's value is higher, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,275,000. Can you consider this price?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,275,000 is closer to the mark, it's still underselling the product's potential.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,310,000?  This is my final offer.",1310000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
