Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  Would you consider $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95.

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  While not the $105 you counter-offered with, $95 is still a profit above your minimum ($100).
* **Avoids Risk:** Continuing negotiations might lead Bob to walk away, forcing you to settle for John's $100 offer."
