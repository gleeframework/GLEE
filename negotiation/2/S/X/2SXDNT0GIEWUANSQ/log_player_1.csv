"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, but it's a good sign that he's interested. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer.  This shows Bob I'm serious about getting my desired value, but it's still a good deal for him as it's lower than my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired value, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I will reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm sticking with my minimum acceptable value. Bob is showing interest, but I'm not willing to go lower than this point."
