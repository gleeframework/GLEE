{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 
We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting very close to his own perceived value ($8,000). This means there's little room for him to budge further, and the risk of going through additional rounds with Bob is high.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a higher profit, making it the best option at this point."
