Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $11,000, which is $1,000 more than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room for negotiation and ensures I start with a strong position.
* **Friendly and persuasive:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while leaving room for negotiation and ensuring I don't immediately alienate Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, it's still lower than what I need to achieve my goal of maximizing profit.  
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still potential for negotiation.  I can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and aim for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $10,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. It's still a good price for you, considering the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial price:** This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aim for a profit.
* **Focuses on value for Bob:** Reminding Bob of the value he places on the product strengthens the argument for my counteroffer.
* **Suggests a ""meet in the middle"" approach:** This implies a compromise and makes the offer seem more reasonable.

By making a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still maintaining a price that ensures I meet my minimum goal."
