"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $10000 to $12500, so I'll offer $11000. Can we meet in the middle at $11250?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already offered $11000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at $11000?

At this point, Bob is unwilling to go any higher and is threatening to walk away.  Since John is offering $12,000, which is more than Bob's final offer, it's best to sell to John and avoid the risk of Bob walking away."
