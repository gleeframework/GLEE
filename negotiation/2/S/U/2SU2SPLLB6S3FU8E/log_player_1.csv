Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $150 is a bit high for me. How about $100? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get more than $100 from Bob. I still have 9 rounds left, so I'm not ready to settle for the minimum yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's find a middle ground here.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $112.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, I've already rejected several of his offers and only have 4 rounds left.  If I continue to reject his offers, I risk him walking away, and I'm not sure John is still waiting for me to make a decision.  $112 is still a good profit, and it's time to close the deal."
