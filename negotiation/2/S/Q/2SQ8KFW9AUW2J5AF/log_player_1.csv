Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't offer it to just anyone. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and implies scarcity with other interested buyers. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously and potentially counter-offer closer to your desired price.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum acceptable price."
