"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is very reasonable considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is offering the product at a price higher than your maximum budget and higher than John's offer. It makes the most sense to buy from John at the lower price."
