Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable.  How does $115 sound?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer,  while still ensuring a profit above John's offer.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:**  The message aims to be appealing without being overly aggressive. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
