"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,300,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than John's price of $1,200,000.  It makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price or move to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to John's price as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $1,250,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob's seriousness in buying the product.  This price is also halfway between Alice's offer and Bob's maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is higher than Bob's initial counteroffer and further away from his desired price. It is still higher than John's offer. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and continuing negotiations seems like the best strategy. Bob can try to lower the price further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,275,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his target price while still acknowledging Alice's need to make a profit.  $1,275,000 is a slight increase from his previous offer but still below John's price. It signals his willingness to negotiate but also establishes a firm limit.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while potentially leading Alice to accept a price closer to Bob's goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly higher than Bob's desired price and even exceeds his maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Alice is not showing any flexibility in her pricing, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a favorable outcome.  It's better for Bob to accept John's offer of $1,200,000 and secure the product within his budget.  There is a risk of Alice dropping her price in subsequent rounds, but given her unwillingness to budge so far, it's a gamble Bob shouldn't take."
