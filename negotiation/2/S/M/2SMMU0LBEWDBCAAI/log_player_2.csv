You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  $850,000 is a significant savings over John's price, but there's room to potentially save even more."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see where Alice stands.  This is a strong starting point, but I'm prepared to negotiate further."

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying the product from Alice.  However, I'm still leaving room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000

Alice has come down significantly and is now very close to my ideal price.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are small compared to the risk of Alice walking away or me losing the product to John. It's time to accept the offer."
