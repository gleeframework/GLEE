{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I aim for a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) than my minimum ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:**  While I have a backup buyer, a quicker sale is generally preferable. This offer strikes a balance between maximizing profit and closing the deal."
