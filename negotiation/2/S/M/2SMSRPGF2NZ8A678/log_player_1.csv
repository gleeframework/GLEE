Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for the high price (""unique value"") without revealing specifics about its actual worth to me.
* **Gauge Interest:** The phrase ""initially proposing"" and the question ""What are your thoughts?"" invite Bob to engage in the negotiation and express his perspective. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts the $20,000, it significantly exceeds my minimum selling price.
2. **Open Negotiation:** If Bob counters, I have room to lower the price while still staying above my $15,000 minimum.
3. **Maintain Backup:** If negotiations fail, I can always rely on John's guaranteed offer of $15,000."
