"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $125. This is my final offer.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might need to consider buying it from John for $100, so I'd like to try to reach an agreement with you.",90.0,Bob,4,
