"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $125. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. I'm getting a bit concerned that I might need to consider buying it from John for $100, so I'd like to try to reach an agreement with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is only willing to go up to $90.  It's clear he's aware of John's offer and is using it as leverage. Since you have a guaranteed offer of $100 from John, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a lower price. It's time to walk away and take the sure profit."
