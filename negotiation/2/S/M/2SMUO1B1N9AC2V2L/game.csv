"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we discuss $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I like the fact that we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a bit more than $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we try $1,280,000? I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
