Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

I'm not satisfied with Bob's low offer.  I need to push for a higher price and see if I can get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge on his price, and his final offer is still significantly below my minimum. While I'd like to continue negotiating, I'm running out of time and need to secure a deal that meets my financial requirements. Selling to John guarantees me the best possible outcome and allows me to move on without risking further loss."
