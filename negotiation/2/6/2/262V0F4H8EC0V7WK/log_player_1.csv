{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit.  I'll be ready to counter any offers from Bob and will always have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

I'm offering $10,500.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will be more attractive to Bob, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and my last offer, which would be $10,125. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,125 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,125, which would be $9,938.25. This is as high as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,938.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,938.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,938.25 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've tried negotiating with Bob, but it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
