Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Product_Price:** I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, giving me room to negotiate if needed.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, highlighting the product's value to Bob. This could encourage him to consider the offer even if it's slightly above his initial expectation.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher starting price increases my chances of getting a good price.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still adjust the price down if Bob is hesitant, while still ensuring I make more than my minimum requirement.
* **Positive communication:** Building a good rapport with Bob might make him more open to the offer. 

Remember, this is just a starting point.  The optimal strategy might change depending on Bob's response and your overall negotiation skills."
