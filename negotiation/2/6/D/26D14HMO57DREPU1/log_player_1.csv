Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to try to get a better price than $110.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm not sure Bob will be willing to go higher, but I can try."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? That's still a great price for a product worth $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $108 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference one last time and go with $109.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 109}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $107 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

We've reached round 8 and Bob is still stubbornly low with his offers. I've tried to be flexible, but it's clear he's not going to meet my minimum desired price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120.  This is a better outcome than selling to Bob for $107, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
