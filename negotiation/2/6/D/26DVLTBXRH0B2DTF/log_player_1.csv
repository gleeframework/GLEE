Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,250,000. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $1,200,000. While I'm hoping for a better price, I know this is what the product is worth to me and I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is persistently offering lower than my minimum value.  While I could keep going with counteroffers, it's becoming clear that he's not willing to meet my price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price and ensures I don't lose out on any potential profit."
