"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000?  This is a significant discount, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
