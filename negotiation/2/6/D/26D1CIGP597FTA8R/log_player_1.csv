{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also making it clear that I value the product highly, which could help me in negotiations later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that doesn't meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, I can't go lower than $105.  This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to fairly compensate for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've found another option that might suit both of our needs better. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $100. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum price, it's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  John is a guaranteed buyer, but I'd rather make a sale to Bob if possible."
