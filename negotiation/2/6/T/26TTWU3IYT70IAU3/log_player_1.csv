{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm starting with an asking price of $25,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 25000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay up to $12000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to drop that much at this stage. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000, which still represents a significant value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has remained firm on his offer of $12,000, which is far below my minimum acceptable price.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  Rather than continuing to negotiate, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I get a price that's at least close to what I believe the product is worth."
