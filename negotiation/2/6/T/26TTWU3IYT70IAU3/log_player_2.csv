"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm starting with an asking price of $25000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and hopefully get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay up to $12,000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that offer?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $18000, which still represents a significant value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum willingness to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
