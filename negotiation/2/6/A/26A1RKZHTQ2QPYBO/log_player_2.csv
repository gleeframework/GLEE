"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $1,000,000 to you.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit margin for me.  Consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product is a perfect fit for your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While the product is valuable to him, it's worth less to him than to Alice.  By rejecting Alice's offer, he can purchase the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving $50,000."
