"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $900,000. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  I could go up to $950,000.  This is a fair offer considering my budget and the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",975000.0,Alice,5,
