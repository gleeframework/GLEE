"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find some common ground. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
