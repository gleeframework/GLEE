,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $135 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, considering my maximum limit.  Let me know if this works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your offer. To accommodate your needs while still reflecting the value of our product, I would like to propose a price of $95. This is a bit higher than your offer but significantly lower than the original price. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $87.50?  This feels like a fair compromise given our previous offers.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. Considering the value of our product and trying to meet you halfway, I would like to suggest a price of $90. This is slightly higher than your last offer, but it's also closer to my initial asking price. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",90.0,Alice,5,
