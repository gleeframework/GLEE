{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** Offering a price of $20,000 is a good starting point. It's a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Stating I'm open to negotiation demonstrates flexibility and willingness to reach a deal. 
* **Asking for Feedback:**  Encouraging Bob to respond allows me to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to initiate a negotiation while leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer.  By starting high, I'm maximizing potential earnings while also setting the stage for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can initiate a counteroffer. I want to see if I can bridge the gap and reach a price closer to my desired value. Selling to John at this moment would guarantee $15,000, but I believe there's room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $17,000, which is still above my minimum value of $15,000 but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting the Discount:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant discount from my initial offer, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Finality:**  I'm indicating that this is the lowest I can go, putting pressure on Bob to accept or potentially walk away.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum price.  By emphasizing the discount and suggesting finality, I hope to encourage Bob to consider accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a more aggressive counteroffer. How about $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While negotiating further could potentially yield a higher price, I'm no longer confident that I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

At this point, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees a price that meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to an even lower price."
