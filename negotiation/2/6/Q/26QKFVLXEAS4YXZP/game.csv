"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $17000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
