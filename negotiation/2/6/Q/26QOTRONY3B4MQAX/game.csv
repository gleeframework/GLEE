"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
