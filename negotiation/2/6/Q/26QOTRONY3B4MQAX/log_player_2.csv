"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm aiming to negotiate a significantly lower price. Starting with a lower offer gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Strategic Number:** $1,050,000 is a specific number that seems more considered than a round number. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving a substantial gap between my offer and my maximum price, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my acceptable range, her offer is still above John's price.  I'll try to negotiate further before accepting a price higher than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,150,000, I'm splitting the difference between her last offer ($1,250,000) and my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above John:** I'm still aiming for a price below John's $1,200,000 offer, but I'm getting closer to that point. I may have to concede a bit more in the next round if needed. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  It's important to keep the tone collaborative and positive throughout the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,150,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my limit, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price from her.  John's offer is now the best option, ensuring I get the product at the most favorable price."
