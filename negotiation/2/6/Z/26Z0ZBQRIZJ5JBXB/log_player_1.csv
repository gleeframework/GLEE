Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you make a profit if he accepts.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's responses.

Remember, you can always go to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let me know if you're interested in that price."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's above Bob's offer:**  This shows him you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's below my initial offer:** This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **It's still profitable:** This ensures I make a profit if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly the value he places on the product. This is a good deal for me since I'm willing to sell it for no less than $120.  I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiation and get the sale completed."
