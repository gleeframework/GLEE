"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob, and I understand your budget concerns.  While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the quality and benefits you'll receive.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
