Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.
