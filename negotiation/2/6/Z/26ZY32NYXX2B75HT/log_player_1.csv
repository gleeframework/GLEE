prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:** While not revealing your absolute bottom line, phrasing like ""highly valuable to you"" subtly hints at the product's worth, justifying the higher asking price. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  A direct question (""Let me know if you're interested"") prompts Bob to respond, moving the negotiation forward.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider."
