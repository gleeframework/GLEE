"I've already offered you a few different prices, Bob. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",10000.0,Alice,7,

"I've already met you halfway, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. If you're not serious about buying the product, I'd rather sell it to someone who is. I'm giving you one last chance to meet me at $10000. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
