"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $11500?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to move forward with the sale.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within your reach. Let's make this deal happen.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9750, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
