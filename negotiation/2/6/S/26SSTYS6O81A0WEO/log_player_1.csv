"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $20,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and has a high budget. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial goal of $20,000, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and $16,000 is a good price. It's only $1,000 less than my counteroffer, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation.  There's a risk that if I reject again, he may walk away or we'll get stuck in a stalemate."
