"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a relatively high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence and Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to discussion and willing to find a price that works for both of us. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining. I'll also consider the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John for the minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $14000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I still believe there's room for improvement.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price before considering selling to John.  
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further. 

**Next Step:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than his offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $14,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing my willingness to compromise and presenting the offer as a fair middle ground.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product.
* **Mutual Satisfaction:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the potential for both of us to be happy with the outcome.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** I'm trying to find a price that's palatable for both of us while still allowing for some profit.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 7 rounds left, I have time to negotiate further if necessary.
* **Risk Assessment:** I'm still weighing the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially having to sell to John for $10,000."
