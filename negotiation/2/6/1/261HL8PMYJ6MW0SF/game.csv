"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to you. It's something I'm confident would be worth at least $800,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a slightly discounted price of $850,000. This represents a significant value proposition for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,1,
