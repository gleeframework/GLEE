"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying $18,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
