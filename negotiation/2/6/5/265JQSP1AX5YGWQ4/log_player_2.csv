# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $18,000. This is not a good deal for Bob. He should counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $16,000. This is still a good deal for me, considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think?

While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate further. He can still get a better deal than what Alice is offering, or he can buy from John."
