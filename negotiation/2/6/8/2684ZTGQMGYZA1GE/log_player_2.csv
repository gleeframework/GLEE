"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm looking to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal to buy from Alice at $120, as you can get the same product from John for $100.  We'll start by rejecting her offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, given its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While Alice's offer of $110 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum price point. Since you can get the product from John for $100, it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid further negotiations."
