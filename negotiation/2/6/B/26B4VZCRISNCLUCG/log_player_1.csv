"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it for $10,000, which is a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 offer:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Setting the stage for negotiation:**  The message leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation going.

**Important Note:** This strategy focuses on balancing maximizing profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm aiming for a win-win scenario, but I'm also ready to switch to John if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $9,500? This would be a fantastic deal for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm also considering buying the product from John for $8,000. I'd like to make a serious offer, so how about $8,800? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While Bob has mentioned John, his offer of $8,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **John is a strong option:**   John's offer of $12,000 is much more attractive than Bob's current offer, even with the mention of John's offer.
* **Negotiation is risky:**  I'm wary of the risk that Bob might actually go with John, so I'm hesitant to continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price, but I will also make it clear that I'm serious about selling to John if we can't come to an agreement. This will put pressure on Bob to meet my price or risk losing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're considering John's offer, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $9,100.  This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be moving forward with John.  The decision is yours."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm sticking to a price closer to my desired value but have lowered it slightly to show good faith.
* **Highlighting the alternative:**  I'm explicitly referencing John's offer, creating urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Giving Bob the final say:**  I'm emphasizing that the decision is ultimately Bob's, giving him a sense of control while also putting pressure on him.

**Important Note:** I'm approaching the final rounds of negotiation. If Bob doesn't accept this offer, I will likely move forward with John to secure the higher price."
