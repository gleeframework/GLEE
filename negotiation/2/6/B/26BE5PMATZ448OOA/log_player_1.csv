This offer allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring a profit for me.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter-offer or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below $80. I'd rather take the guaranteed $80 from John than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with less."
