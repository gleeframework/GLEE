"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a good value for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $10,000?  It's a fair price that's good for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down just a little more.  Let's meet at $9,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. If we don't close this deal, I'll be forced to explore other options.",9900.0,Alice,7,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still thinking $9,500 is the sweet spot. Can we meet there?",9500.0,Bob,8,
