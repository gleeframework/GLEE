{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This allows room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value proposition to Bob, suggesting a fair price for both parties.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an invitation for discussion, showing I am willing to negotiate. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while also maintaining a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, there is still room for negotiation. I can potentially increase the price closer to my desired range.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counter-offer that is still higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation.
* **Potential for Compromise:** There is still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I'm open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
