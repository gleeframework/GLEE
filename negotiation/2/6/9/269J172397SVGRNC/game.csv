"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 to start. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me right now.  How about $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and meet at $122?",122.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $122 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $118?  It's close to your last offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that price.",118.0,Bob,4,
