"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and definitely worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above your maximum limit.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit outside my budget.  How about $125?  I'm pretty serious about buying this if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $132.50? I'm still willing to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$132.50 is still within your budget and a reasonable compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John and saves you from further negotiation rounds that may not result in a lower price."
