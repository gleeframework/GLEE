{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's preferred price, but it's getting closer to his budget.  Given that Bob can get the product from John for $1,000,000, accepting this offer saves Bob some negotiation time and potentially a higher price if Alice counteroffers again."
