Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with my ideal price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I can afford to be firm and see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is still a significant discount from my ideal price, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a good deal for him, and that we can reach an agreement."
