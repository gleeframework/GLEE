"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While it looks great, $14,500 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you do $10,000? That's the very top of my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
