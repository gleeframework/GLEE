"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This price is fair considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm really hoping to make this deal work, but I'm also mindful of my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
