"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at $15,000, you have no incentive to accept her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you no downside."
