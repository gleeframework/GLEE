"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,600,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't let this go for that low.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your need for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?  That's a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can go. If we can meet at that price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
