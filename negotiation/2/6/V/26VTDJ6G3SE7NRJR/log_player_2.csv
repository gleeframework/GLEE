"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get a great deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful and clearly states your interest while also conveying that the initial price is too high. 
* **Strategic Goal:** By starting low, you aim to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure the product for a price significantly below your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $110 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a solid price, saving you $25 off your maximum budget and $15 off Alice's initial offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice compromised by moving closer to your counteroffer. This suggests she is willing to negotiate fairly.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you might be able to get the price a little lower by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk Alice could walk away. Accepting now secures a good price and avoids the potential of having to buy from John for $150."
