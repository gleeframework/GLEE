"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product for a price below its true value to you, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is lower than your maximum price, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if needed."
