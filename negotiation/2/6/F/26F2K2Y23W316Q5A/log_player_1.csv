{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum value but still leaves room for potential compromise.  This strategy balances the potential for a higher profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, so accepting it would be a loss. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This still gives you a good deal, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer allows me to sell the product without losing money and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
