"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives you a substantial profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while still providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us.  It allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a good profit.  Let's settle on this and close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
