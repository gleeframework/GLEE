Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  $1,200,000 is still a lot more than Alice wants, so there's room to bargain."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for further negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer."
