"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can both be happy with the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
