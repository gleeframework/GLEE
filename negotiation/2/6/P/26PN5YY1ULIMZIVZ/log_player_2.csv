"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely do better.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. $10,500 is closer to his target but still above his ideal price.  He should reject the offer and see if he can push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best deal possible and is willing to keep negotiating. He is closer to his target price but still has room to try and negotiate lower. It is unlikely Alice will accept a price below $10,000 but Bob can try to meet in the middle between his counteroffer and her offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,125 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $9,900 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached a point where the price difference is minimal.  While he could continue negotiating, the potential savings are small.  Given that he has a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000, it's in his best interest to buy from John and avoid any further potential delays or negotiation rounds."
