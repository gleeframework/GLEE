"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,125 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close, but $9,900 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle on $10,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,7,
