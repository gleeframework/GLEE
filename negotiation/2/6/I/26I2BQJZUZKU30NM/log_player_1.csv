Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
