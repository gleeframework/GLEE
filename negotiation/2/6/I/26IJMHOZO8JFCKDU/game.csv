"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $85 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I hope it works for you as well. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy it.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I can offer you the product for $112.50. That's a significant drop from my last offer, and it's still above my minimum. Let me know if that works for you.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still trying to stay below $100, though.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that.",95.0,Bob,6,
