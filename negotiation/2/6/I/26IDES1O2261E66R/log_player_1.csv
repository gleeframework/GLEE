Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120 but still potentially attractive to Bob, who values the product at $120.  I'm hoping to get as close to his value as possible without risking a rejection that could lead to a lower price from John."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing a sale and ending up with only $120 from John.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
