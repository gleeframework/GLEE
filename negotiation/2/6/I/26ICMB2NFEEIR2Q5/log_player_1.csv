{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value ($150) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a tempting offer, it's a bit too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference and go with $160?  I believe this price still gives you a great deal while ensuring I can sell it fairly."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $140. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping my budget in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  John is offering a guaranteed $150, which is a better deal for me right now. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John."
