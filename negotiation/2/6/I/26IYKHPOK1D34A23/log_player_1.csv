This offer starts with a price that is above Bob's perceived value, but still allows room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet you halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not what I'm aiming for.  I'll counteroffer once more, and see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
