Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning that this is an exclusive offer before you go to other buyers might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality and negotiation style, you might adjust your approach."
