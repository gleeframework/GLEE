Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for a very reasonable price. I know you're a discerning buyer, so I'm confident you'll see the value in it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open-ended. I want to pique Bob's interest without giving away too much information about the product's value to me.
* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent markup from my minimum acceptable value, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price higher than my minimum, I'm hoping to entice Bob into making a counteroffer. This allows for a negotiation process where I can potentially earn more than my minimum while still ensuring a sale.  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I have no risk in offering a higher price."
