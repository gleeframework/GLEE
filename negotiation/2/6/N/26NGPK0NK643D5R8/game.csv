"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you'll gain.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business.  I could consider a price of $1,150,000, which reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I want to make this work for both of us.  How about we split the difference between your offer and my last asking price? That would be $1,087,500.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer.  I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $1,050,000 and call it a deal?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
