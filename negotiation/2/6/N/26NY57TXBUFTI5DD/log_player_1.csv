Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's in great condition and worth a lot more, but I'm willing to make you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, as the product is worth $120 to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down depending on Bob's response. 

This strategy allows you to maximize your profit while leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is higher than your minimum of $80 and is still a good deal for you, as it's closer to your initial asking price of $100.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and maximizes your profit in this scenario."
