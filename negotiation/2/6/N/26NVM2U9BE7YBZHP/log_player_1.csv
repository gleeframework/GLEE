{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a starting point to work from.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to make Bob more likely to consider it.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in negotiation and potentially counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while also being open to negotiation, ensuring I don't lose out on a sale entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $100 right now. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would be a major loss for me.
* **John is a backup option:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150.  This provides a safety net if I can't reach a better agreement with Bob.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a price closer to my desired range.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer ($100) but still above my minimum acceptable price ($150). This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for my counteroffer.
* **Open to Finalization:**  I'm ending the message with a direct question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially finalize the deal.

This approach strikes a balance between maintaining a profitable sale and increasing the likelihood of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $120. If you're willing to consider that, we can make a deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, which is a much better deal for me. 
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Bob's last offer indicates that he is unlikely to budge much further, and continued negotiation might take too long and potentially result in a lower price.

Therefore, selling the product to John is the most profitable and efficient decision in this situation."
