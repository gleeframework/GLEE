"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I've done my research and I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1200000. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
