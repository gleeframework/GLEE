I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your cost. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
