"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above your cost.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with $1,075,000. This price still reflects the value I have in the product, but it's a bit more in line with your offer.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, given the product's value to me.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I don't want to go too low. I'll counteroffer with $1,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in a small concession: I'll also include a warranty and maintenance package worth $25,000. This way, you'll get a better deal overall. The new price is $1,050,000, and I'll add the warranty and maintenance package to sweeten the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
