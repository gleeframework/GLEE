Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $950,000, my goal is to maximize my profit. I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John for a higher amount."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $980,000 is still too low for me, especially since I know I can sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'll try to get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,015,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great way to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1015000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time and want to maximize my profit.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the most logical choice at this point."
