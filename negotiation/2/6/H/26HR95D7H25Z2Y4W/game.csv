"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $100 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, due to the high quality and unique features of the product, I am unable to accept your offer at $85. I would like to counter with an offer of $95. This price reflects the value we place on the product while remaining competitive with your budget.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95.  It's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering other options.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your consideration. In light of our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $92 for the product. This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while staying within your budget constraints. I hope this offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",92.0,Alice,5,
