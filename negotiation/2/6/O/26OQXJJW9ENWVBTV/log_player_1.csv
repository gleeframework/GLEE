Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I can go. If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but I'm ready to make a deal today at that number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I could push for more, Bob has now met his maximum valuation. Accepting the $800,000 offer is a significant profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or having to rely on John."
