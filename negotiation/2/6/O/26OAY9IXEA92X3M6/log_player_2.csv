# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's first offer is significantly above my limit and what I know I can get it for from John. I need to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! Unfortunately, $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $120. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still more than I want to pay. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That would be a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $100. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $115, and I'm not willing to pay more than $100. It's time to cut my losses and go with my guaranteed option of buying from John."
