"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! Unfortunately, $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $120. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That would be a price I'm comfortable with.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $100. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we try $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
