"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 145}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. There's a high chance we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds that satisfies both of us. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer of $120."
