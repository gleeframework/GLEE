"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $750000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1000000 just doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we compromise at $1350000? This would be a win-win for both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  While I understand your position, $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To make things easier, let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a fair price, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire this valuable asset.

"I'm really interested in this product, but I'm starting to feel like I need to consider other options. If we can't meet at $1100000, I'll have to explore other opportunities. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1100000.0,Bob,8,
