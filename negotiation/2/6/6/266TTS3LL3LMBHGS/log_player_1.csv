Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, vaguely mentioning ""value and potential""  provides a basis for the offer without revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding, suggesting you're open to discussing the price further if Bob shows interest but wants to negotiate.

By aiming high initially, you increase the chances of:

* **Bob accepting outright:**  If Bob is particularly eager or the perceived value is high for him, he might agree to the initial price.
* **Securing a higher final price:** Even if Bob negotiates, you're starting from a strong position, making it more likely you'll end up with a price well above your minimum."
