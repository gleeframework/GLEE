Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about we settle around $800,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and a fair deal for both of us."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $800,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise significantly and drop to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a great opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reason: Alice has indicated this is her final offer and it's still significantly higher than our alternative. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down enough to justify the risk of losing the $800,000 option with John."
