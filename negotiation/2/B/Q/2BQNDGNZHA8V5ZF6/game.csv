,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we settle on $850,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $775,000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $800,000. How about we settle on $825,000? This price would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'll try to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $812,500. Can you consider that?",812500.0,Bob,6,
