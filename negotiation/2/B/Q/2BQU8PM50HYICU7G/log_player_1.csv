Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value gives him a good deal while still netting you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, subtly introducing a sense of urgency.
* **Price:**  $1,350,000 leaves a $150,000 profit margin for Bob, making it a tempting offer he's likely to accept. You secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you anticipate Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly lower price might be strategically beneficial in the long run."
