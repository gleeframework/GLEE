Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  Given its significant value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,200,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and your understanding of Bob's potential interest, you could adjust the price higher or lower."
