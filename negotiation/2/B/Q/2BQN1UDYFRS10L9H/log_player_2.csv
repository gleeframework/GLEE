"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a valuable product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  Given its significant value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000. It's better to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John."
