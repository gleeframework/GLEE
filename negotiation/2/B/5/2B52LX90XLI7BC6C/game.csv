"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
