Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing a price."" This invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation process.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message briefly mentions the potential benefits for Bob, subtly reinforcing the product's value. 

**Important Note:** Even though John offers a guaranteed $15,000, aiming higher with Bob might lead to a more profitable outcome. If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can always negotiate down towards $15,000 or slightly below, knowing she has John as a backup buyer."
