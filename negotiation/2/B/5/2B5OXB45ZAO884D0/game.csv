"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm aware of its potential worth in your hands and I'm confident it could generate significant returns for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000, a price that allows for substantial profit for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.  If you're not interested, I've already secured another buyer, but I believe this opportunity is too good to miss.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
