"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than to Bob. This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, hoping to make it more appealing to Bob.  $1,300,000 is still a good amount for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better offer in the following rounds. I believe there's still room for us to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get the minimum amount I'm willing to accept for the product.  I believe that $1,200,000 is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  With only a few rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob. John's offer ensures I receive my desired price."
