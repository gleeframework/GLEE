"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm still a bit short on the price. I can do $13,000, which is my absolute minimum. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is your minimum, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we split the difference and agree on $12,250?",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $12,250 is still a bit shy of my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me there?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $12,500, but that's absolutely my limit.  It's a fair offer considering your minimum and my budget.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I can see that you're willing to meet me at $12,500, but I'm not sure if I want to sell it to you at that price. I'm going to make one final offer: $13,000, and if you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, Bob.",13000.0,Alice,9,
