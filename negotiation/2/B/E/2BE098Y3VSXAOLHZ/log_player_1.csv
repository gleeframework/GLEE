Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll really value. I'm willing to sell it for $95.  I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the message implies I'm open to discussion, potentially leading to a price Bob is happy with, above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup at $80 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate, so I can confidently aim high with Bob."
