"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($120)** is better than buying from John ($150), but it's still not the best deal for Bob. 
* **Bob's goal** is to save as much money as possible. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer** gives Bob the opportunity to potentially find a better price from another seller or negotiate with Alice further."
