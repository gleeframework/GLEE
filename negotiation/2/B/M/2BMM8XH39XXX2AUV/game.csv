"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price point reflects the value you'll gain while still recognizing the product's unique nature.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",825000.0,Bob,4,
