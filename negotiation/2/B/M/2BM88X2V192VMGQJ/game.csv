"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $825,000? This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $760,000?",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $760,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go.",800000.0,Alice,5,
