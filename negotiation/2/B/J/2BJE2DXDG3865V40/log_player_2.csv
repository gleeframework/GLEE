"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price, as the product is worth considerably more to you than it is to me.  I'm confident that this transaction will be mutually beneficial. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. Please let me know your decision.
