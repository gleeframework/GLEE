"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for, and I believe it would be worth at least $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a good profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,1,
