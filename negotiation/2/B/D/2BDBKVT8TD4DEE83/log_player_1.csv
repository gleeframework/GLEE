Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is still a good profit margin for me (above my minimum $150 value).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $130 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to find a price we both agree on.
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message can make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a win-win situation. I want to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I also don't want to risk losing the sale completely. By starting with a high offer and being open to negotiation, I can increase my chances of securing a profitable deal. If Bob rejects my offer and makes a counteroffer, I will carefully assess his offer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested. I can counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value. My aim is to push for a higher price while still keeping the negotiation open. If Bob continues to offer prices too low, I'll consider selling to John for $150 to avoid losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $130 to $120. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a decent profit margin for me.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and emphasizing that $120 is still a good deal.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value while still being attractive to Bob. This counteroffer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to carefully consider his next offer and whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No room for negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, the gap between our desired prices is still significant. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower profit. John's offer of $150 is a guaranteed profit, and I'm choosing to take the secure option."
