Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. I'm aiming to get as much as possible, while still being open to a deal. If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest level and make a counteroffer accordingly.  The fallback option with John provides a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not willing to settle for that. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a higher price.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum value.  I'm not sure if I can get a better deal with him, and I don't want to risk losing him completely.  Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point."
