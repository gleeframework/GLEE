"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value but still allows me to make a good profit. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is a decent price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm proposing a counteroffer of $95, which is still a good deal for Bob but gives me a larger profit margin. It's a compromise that I hope will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $95. I was thinking more like $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of getting at least $90 for the product.  I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, but I'm still confident this is a fair price for both of us. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $87.50, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$87.50 is still too low for me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round.  While I could sell to John for $80, I think I can still get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $89? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm offering a compromise at $89. It's still a decent profit for me and it's a small jump from Bob's last offer. Hopefully, he'll see that it's a fair price and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $89. I was thinking more like $86. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been pushing for a better price, but Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than getting nothing at all."
