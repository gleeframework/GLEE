"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $89? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",89.0,Alice,7,

I'm not willing to go up to $89. I was thinking more like $86. Can you meet me there?,86.0,Bob,8,
