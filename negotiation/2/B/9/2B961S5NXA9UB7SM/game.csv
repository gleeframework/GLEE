"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. How about $10,500?  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference one last time and go with $10,125? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher. Please consider this my final offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
