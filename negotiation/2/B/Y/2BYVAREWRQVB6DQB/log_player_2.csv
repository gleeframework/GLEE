"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,200,000. It's a unique and high-quality item that I'm sure you'll find very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to  $600,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite but Firm:** I'm being polite to maintain a good negotiating relationship, but I'm also making it clear that the initial offer is unrealistic for me. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  My goal is to get a price that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price while still leaving her with a reasonable profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice came down significantly, $900,000 is still too high.  I'll try to negotiate closer to $700,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down $300,000, I came up $100,000.  Proposing a middle ground at $700,000 seems like a reasonable next step.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will show me if Alice is willing to go significantly below her last offer, or if she's firm on a price closer to $900,000.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** If Alice rejects this offer, I'm getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. This gives me some unspoken leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, which is $800,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as they are both offering the same price."
