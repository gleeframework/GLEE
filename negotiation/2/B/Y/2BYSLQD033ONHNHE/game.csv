"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $200 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $150? ",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to go down to $160? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $165, which is a bit above your offer but still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",165.0,Alice,5,
