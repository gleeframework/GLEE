(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the first offer gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also acknowledges that Alice has a lower value for the product, incentivizing her to make a deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is slightly higher than her previous offer, but still within your acceptable range. However, we can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation. You have already shown Alice that you're willing to walk away, so she might be more motivated to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise but still aiming for a good price.  It also leaves room for Alice to negotiate further while still being a good deal for you."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down in price, as she's already rejected a lower offer from you. You're still better off negotiating than buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to your maximum price, but you're still better off trying to negotiate further. You've shown Alice you're willing to compromise, but also that you're not afraid to walk away.  One more round of negotiation could potentially get you a better price, especially as you're nearing your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a final push for a good deal.  It's a significant compromise from your previous offer, showing Alice you're serious about buying the product. However, it's still below her offer, leaving a little room for her to accept.  If she rejects, you're likely to accept her next offer or purchase from John."
