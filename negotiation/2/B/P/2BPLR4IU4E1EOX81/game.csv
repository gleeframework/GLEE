,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest. $12,000 is quite a bit below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly interested and I want to find a way to make this work. $14,000 is pushing it but I can go as low as $17,000. I'm hoping we can close this deal soon.",17000.0,Alice,5,
