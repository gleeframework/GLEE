"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $13500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations while still providing a reasonable return for me.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $13500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your offer, I am willing to reconsider and present a counteroffer of $13250 for the product. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more accommodating to your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
