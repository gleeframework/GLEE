"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.  You can potentially get a better price than $14,000, and you are still saving money compared to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $13500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your financial considerations while still providing a reasonable return for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,500 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit above my budget at $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,000?  This would be a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. In light of your offer, I am willing to reconsider and present a counteroffer of $13250 for the product. This price still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more accommodating to your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.

This is a good deal for Bob. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a reasonable compromise that saves him $250 compared to buying from John.  It's also a fair price for Alice, as it's above her minimum acceptable price."
