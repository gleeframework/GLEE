"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and a sense of opportunity.
* **Strategic Value Mention:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob subtly reinforces his potential gain from the purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, given that he's expressed interest in the product.
* **Time is on My Side:** I still have 8 rounds left to close a deal, and selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit for you and is closer to my expectations. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight Potential Profit:**  I'm reiterating the potential profit for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Maintain a Friendly Tone:** The message remains polite and constructive, keeping the negotiation positive."
