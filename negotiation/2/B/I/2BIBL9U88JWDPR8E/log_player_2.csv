"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's offer, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to his $150 limit. Rejecting allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the enthusiasm!  I'm interested but I'd need to get the price down a bit more to make it work for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $120 to $110, which is closer to Bob's desired price point.  While there's still room for negotiation, accepting the offer at $110 saves Bob $40 compared to John's price and is a decent deal.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product entirely if Alice becomes unwilling to go lower."
