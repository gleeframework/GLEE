"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to let it go for $999000. This is a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits. What do you think?",999000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a great product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $999000. Can we meet in the middle at $825000?",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could find a price that better reflects the product's true value. Considering your interest and willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my original price. I'll counter with $875000. This is a fair compromise that still acknowledges the product's unique value. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $875000. I'd like to propose a compromise of my own - how about $825000, the same as my previous offer? If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll counter with $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's unique value and the effort I've put into it. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to moving forward with the sale. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
