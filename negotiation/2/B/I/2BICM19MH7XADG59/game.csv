"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $7,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To find a middle ground, I would like to propose an offer of $12,000 for the product.

"Hello again Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000. I feel this price point represents a fair compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
