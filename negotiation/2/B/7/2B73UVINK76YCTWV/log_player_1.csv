Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still aiming for a significantly higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies high demand (""interest I've had"") to justify the price, even though you have a guaranteed buyer lined up. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

By starting high, you maximize your chances of either getting Bob to accept a higher price or negotiating down to a price that's still more profitable than your guaranteed sale to John."
