"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a rare opportunity and I know it's worth a lot to you. My initial price is $950,000. Let's discuss and see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $825,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",825000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $825,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'm thinking of $850,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I really need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
