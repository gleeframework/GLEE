"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $10,900? That would be a good compromise for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,5,
