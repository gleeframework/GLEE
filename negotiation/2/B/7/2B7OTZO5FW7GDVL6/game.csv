"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $18000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $12000, and I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you halfway just yet. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $16000. I believe this price still reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a fair compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Alice! However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $16500. This price is closer to my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal with you.",16500.0,Alice,5,
