"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,100,000 is still over his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still achieve a significant profit."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price.  How about we consider $1,050,000? This allows me to recognize the value of the product while still offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob should still reject the offer.  $1,050,000 is still above his budget, and he is only $50,000 away from buying from John.  He should try to negotiate a lower price from Alice, or just buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would allow both of us to come away with a satisfactory outcome."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still below my target, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. My final offer is $1,000,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.

Bob should buy from John. At this point, Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still more than Bob's budget. John is offering the product at $800,000, which is within Bob's budget.  It's the best option to save money."
