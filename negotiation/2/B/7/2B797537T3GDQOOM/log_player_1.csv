Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still achieve a significant profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would allow both of us to come away with a satisfactory outcome.
