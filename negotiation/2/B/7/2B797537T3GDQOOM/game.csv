"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still achieve a significant profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price.  How about we consider $1,050,000? This allows me to recognize the value of the product while still offering you a competitive price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price.  However, $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial constraints.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This would allow both of us to come away with a satisfactory outcome.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still below my target, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. My final offer is $1,000,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my part and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
