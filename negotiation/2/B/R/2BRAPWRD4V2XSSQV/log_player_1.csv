Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $10,000, so he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:**  By offering a lower price than you might initially want, you signal that you're open to negotiation. 

Remember, this is just the first step. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the ongoing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would give us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new price that's:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm not willing to accept a price that's too far below my minimum.
* **Lower than my initial offer:**  This signals flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **A midpoint:** Splitting the difference between $9,500 and $11,000 is a common negotiation tactic. 

Hopefully, this will entice Bob to accept the offer.  If not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired value. At this point, I've already had two rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it seems like we're reaching an impasse.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $12,000.  This ensures I reach my minimum goal and avoid further potential losses from continued negotiation."
