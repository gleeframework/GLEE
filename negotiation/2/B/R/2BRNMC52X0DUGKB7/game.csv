"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true value.  Could you consider $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product and appreciate you working with me.  While $950,000 is closer to my ideal price, I still need to get a bit more out of it. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  This is my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I've already gone above my initial budget, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. My final offer is $920,000. This is the highest I can go.",920000.0,Bob,6,
