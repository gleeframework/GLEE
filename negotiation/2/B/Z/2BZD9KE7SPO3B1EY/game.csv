"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $80 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $95 is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $125, my final offer.",125.0,Alice,5,
