"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

``` 

Bob is still very far from our minimum price. We are better off countering or considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $95 is still quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $125, my final offer."",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** It's time to signal some firmness to Bob.  We're letting him know this is our final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $125 is still a profitable price for us while being significantly closer to Bob's counteroffer. This might encourage him to make a more substantial jump. 
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. By setting a firm final offer, we're pushing Bob to make a decision."
