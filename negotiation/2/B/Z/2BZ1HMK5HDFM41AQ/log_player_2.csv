"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer just for you. I'll sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a more favorable price."
