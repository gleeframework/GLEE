Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value and I'm keen to find it a good home. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer it at $15,000 (its worth to John), there's a chance Bob would pay a bit more. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $14,000 is a strong profit margin above my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a good deal for me. 
* **Friendly Approach:** The message aims to be approachable and non-aggressive, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
