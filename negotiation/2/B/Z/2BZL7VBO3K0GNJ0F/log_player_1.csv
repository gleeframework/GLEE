Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Valuation:** You value the product at a minimum of $120 (and have a guaranteed sale at that price).
* **Goal:** Maximize profit.

Offering the product at $119 creates a win-win situation (or at least appears to):

* **Bob's Perspective:** He gets the product for $19 less than his perceived value.
* **Your Perspective:** You make a $1 profit compared to selling to John.

While selling directly to John would net you $120, there's a chance Bob will accept the $119 offer, securing a slightly smaller but immediate profit."
