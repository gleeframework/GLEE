"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you know you can buy the product from John for $150, it makes no sense to engage in negotiations with Alice. There's no potential to get a better price from her, and even if you did, the negotiation process could take time and effort."
