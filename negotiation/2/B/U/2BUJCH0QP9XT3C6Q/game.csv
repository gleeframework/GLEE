"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet a price higher than $10,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
