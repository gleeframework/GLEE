**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly not budging much on price.  She's gone down in price but is still holding out for a price well above your target.  At this point, it's unlikely you'll get her below $100, and even then, it's a gamble.  Cutting your losses and going with John for $150 guarantees you get the product and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Alice."
