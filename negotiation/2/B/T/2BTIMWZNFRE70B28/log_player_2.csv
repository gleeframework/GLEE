# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a better price from Alice.  $11,500 is too close to your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a bit lower. There's room for Alice to come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about $10,750? That's a good compromise for both of us. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $11,250.  That's a fair price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's still worth trying to get a lower price. $11,250 is still a little too high.  Let's see if we can get Alice to move closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this work. How about $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
