{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives us some room to negotiate. I'm also using positive language to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely."
