"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about $11,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a good middle ground for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,5,
