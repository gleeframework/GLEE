"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with his maximum budget to show Alice he's serious about buying the product but needs a significantly lower price. This opens the negotiation and hopefully leads to a more agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down further.  He has 7 rounds left, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. I understand this is a significant difference, but it's my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial offer, reiterating his maximum budget, while also acknowledging the gap and suggesting they find a compromise. This shows he's serious about buying the product but won't overpay. This also gives Alice a clear understanding of his boundaries."
