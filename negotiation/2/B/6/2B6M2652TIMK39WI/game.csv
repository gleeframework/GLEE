"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle? Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $8,000. I understand this is a significant difference, but it's my maximum. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,
