Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the value of the product might entice Bob to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further. 
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a profitable sale.
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum of $1,200,000.**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still not a profitable deal for me.
* **I have a better option with John.** John is willing to pay my minimum price, ensuring a profitable sale. 

**Next Steps:**

* **I'll reject Bob's offer and prepare a counteroffer.**  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum but still be open to negotiation. 
* **If the negotiation with Bob fails, I'll proceed with the sale to John.**"

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.
