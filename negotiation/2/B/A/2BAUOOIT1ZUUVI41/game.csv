"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1200000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope it meets closer to your minimum acceptable price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and while I appreciate the compromise, I must respectfully decline at this time. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1100000. I believe this is a fair price, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
