"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $150 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $135?  It's closer to your offer and within my budget.",135.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're getting closer to my price, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $140, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference and settle on $130?  That's a fair compromise for both of us.",130.0,Bob,6,
