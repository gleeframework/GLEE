"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit high for me. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  Let's split the difference and go with $87.50?"", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite there yet, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $92.50 is closer to your target, you still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you another chance to get a lower price.  It's a calculated risk, but with 5 rounds remaining, you're not in a desperate situation yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but I'm still hoping to get it for $89.50. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 89.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $90. Let's call it a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're getting closer to your target:** Alice's offer of $90 is only $10 more than your ideal price of $80. 
* **Time is a factor:** You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and you only have three rounds left. 
* **Alternative option is expensive:**  Buying from John for $100 is less appealing than accepting Alice's offer. 

By accepting this offer, you're securing the product for a price that's within your budget and saving $10 compared to buying from John. It's a good compromise and a good deal overall."
