Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think I can make you an offer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's too low. I want to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to offer $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now getting closer to my minimum. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better than selling to John.  I'll accept this offer."
