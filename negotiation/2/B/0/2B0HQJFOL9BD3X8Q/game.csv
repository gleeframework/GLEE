"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $20,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $20,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to go up to $9,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll make a counteroffer of $13,500. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's worth.",13500.0,Alice,5,
