"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you pointing out the uniqueness of the product. However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10000? This is my maximum budget for this type of item.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's still a great deal considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Would you be willing to consider $10500?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're getting close to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10800. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product's value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
