Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down a bit. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so we're not desperate. This gives us leverage to aim higher with Bob."
