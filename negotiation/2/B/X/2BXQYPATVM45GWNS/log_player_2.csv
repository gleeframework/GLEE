"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $800000. While I understand the value may differ for everyone, I'm confident this product can be a game-changer. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm eager to discuss its potential with you further.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,000,000, which is the same price as John's offer. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Since you have a guaranteed option with John for the same price, it makes more sense to buy from John."
