"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a decent price for my product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
