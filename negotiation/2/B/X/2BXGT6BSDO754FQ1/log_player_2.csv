Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a decent price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
