"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good price considering the value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
