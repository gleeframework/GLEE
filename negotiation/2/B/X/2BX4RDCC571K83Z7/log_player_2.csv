"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has great potential for your business. I'm offering it to you for $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above the product's value to you ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to your target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $900,000 is still a bit high compared to your target of saving as much money as possible.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a price closer to your desired range.  You can likely get a lower price by continuing the negotiation process."
