# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $1,115,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently meeting in the middle, signaling his eagerness to close the deal. I'll push a bit further, but I need to be cautious as we're getting closer to my fallback option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,092,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,065,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could push Bob a bit further, his consistent pattern of meeting in the middle suggests he's unlikely to deviate much from this price point. Accepting his offer at $1,065,000 guarantees a significant profit above my $1,000,000 minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in the final rounds."
