"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my maximum is $800,000, I'd like to offer $850,000 as a starting point. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to split the difference from our previous offers and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while respecting my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
