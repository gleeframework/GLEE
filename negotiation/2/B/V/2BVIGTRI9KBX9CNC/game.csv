,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $120 just isn't feasible for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $135. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $130? That's the lowest I can go, and it's still a fair price for a product like this.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $130 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $127 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",127.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  I'm willing to come down to $129. This is a great price for a product like this, and it's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",129.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but $129 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $126 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",126.0,Bob,8,
