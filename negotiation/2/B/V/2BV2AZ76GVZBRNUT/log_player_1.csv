Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
