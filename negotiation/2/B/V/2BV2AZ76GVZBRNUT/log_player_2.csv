"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for you.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $1,100,000. This is a good deal for her but not for me.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my limit. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
