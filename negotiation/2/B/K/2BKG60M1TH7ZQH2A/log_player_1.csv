"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the price you're offering is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is offering $11,500, which is a reasonable profit above your minimum ($12,000). It's generally better to secure a deal rather than risk losing the sale by pushing for a marginally higher price.
