Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I believe a price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product for $12,000 (Bob's maximum), there's a chance he'll try to negotiate. Offering it slightly below his maximum gives the impression of a deal while still securing a significant profit for me.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $8,000. This means I don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob.
* **First Offer Psychology:** Setting the initial offer at a strong but reasonable point helps establish the negotiation framework."
