Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final price. 
* **Higher than John's Offer:** The offer is significantly higher than John's $120 offer, ensuring you're maximizing your potential profit.

By starting the negotiation at $140, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential earnings from Bob while also ensuring you secure a sale at a price significantly above your minimum."
