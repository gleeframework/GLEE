"Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment. Let me know what you think!",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $875,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit more than I can afford right now. Let's split the difference and go with $862,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can close the transaction quickly. What do you think?",862500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $862,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $870,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",870000.0,Alice,5,
