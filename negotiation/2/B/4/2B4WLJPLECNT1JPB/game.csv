"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to make this purchase more cost-effective. I'm ready to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value to me and would allow us both to close a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make the deal more cost-effective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $887,500 for the product.  This price is closer to your desired value, and it would allow us both to close a fair and profitable deal. I believe this is a good compromise that benefits both of us.",887500.0,Bob,4,
