{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd sell to John. This leaves room for negotiation, but I'm aiming for the highest possible profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $100 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit.  $125 is a more realistic price given Bob's initial offer."
