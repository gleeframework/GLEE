Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more. There's a chance he sees even greater value in it.
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always come down, but you can't go up from your initial offer. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy.  In a more complex negotiation with multiple rounds, you might adjust your approach based on Bob's responses and actions."
