"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering to get a better price.  While Bob could buy from John, there's still potential to save money by negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $1,000,000 is certainly appealing,  I believe this product's true value is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This allows me to acknowledge your interest while still reflecting the inherent worth of what I'm offering.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still too high for Bob.  While it's a better price than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price."
