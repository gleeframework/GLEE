Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential $300,000 difference where you both can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you don't want to price Bob out. Offering a price closer to his perceived value increases your chances of a quick sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline, e.g., end of day tomorrow] to allow you time to consider. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and starts on a positive note.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of what he gains.
* **Fairness:**  Using the word ""fair"" frames the price as reasonable.
* **Urgency:** A deadline encourages Bob to act promptly.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  This closing statement reinforces that you're aiming for a win-win.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Have a walk-away price in mind (anything below $1,200,000 wouldn't make sense).
* **Confidence is Key:**  Present your offer with confidence."
