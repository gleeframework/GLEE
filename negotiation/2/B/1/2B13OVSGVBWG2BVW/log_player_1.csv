Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Aiming for $150 allows you to potentially gain a significant profit if Bob values the product more than its worth to him or is willing to pay a premium for convenience.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial high offer also leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually decrease the price, still aiming to stay above your minimum acceptable price of $100. 

By starting high and being willing to negotiate, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob while having the security of John's offer as a backup."
