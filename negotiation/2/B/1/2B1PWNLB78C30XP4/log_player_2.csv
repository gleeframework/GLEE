Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $6,500. This is a reasonable price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $6,250. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This seems like a good point to accept. Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and the price of $6,250 is a reasonable compromise.  It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better price by continuing to negotiate."
