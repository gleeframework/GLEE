{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than my minimum price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm highlighting the product's value for Bob, increasing his motivation to buy.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this product. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $120 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, leaving me with no sale and needing to sell to John for the same price. 
* **Securing the sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum acceptable price."
