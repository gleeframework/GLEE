"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,200. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,200 is still a little high for my budget. Could you do $7,500? That would work much better for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,200 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $8,000. This is already the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8000.0,Alice,5,
