{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}

I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can counteroffer and get closer to my desired amount.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe I can still get a good price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a final compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept.  If he doesn't, I'll consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's final offer is getting too close to my minimum value.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on the sale to John. It's better to secure the $12,000 sale and move on."
