"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this product with me. While it seems like a good product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope you can meet me halfway.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I can offer you $9,750. This is my final offer, as I've also been exploring other options. I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I hope we can still make a deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up just yet. I'll make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,750. I'll offer it to you for $10,125. This is my last offer, so I hope you can see the value in the product and meet me at this price.",10125.0,Alice,7,
