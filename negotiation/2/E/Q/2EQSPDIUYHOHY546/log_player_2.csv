{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, I want to see if I can get it for even less. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $85. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good price and hopefully sparks a negotiation."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $90, which is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
