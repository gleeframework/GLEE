"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $140 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $120? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $135. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Let's try to meet in the middle at $125. I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable with $125. I'm willing to go down to $130, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",130.0,Alice,7,
