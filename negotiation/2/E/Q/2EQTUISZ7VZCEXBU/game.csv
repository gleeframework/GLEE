"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $15,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $16,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
