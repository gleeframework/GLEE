"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2100000. This is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not willing to pay $2100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1950000 is my absolute limit. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. What do you think?",2050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already stretched my budget to meet you halfway, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1900000. This is my absolute limit, and I hope you can understand my position.",1900000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you've reached your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,7,
