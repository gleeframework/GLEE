"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already done some research and I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $85. It's the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's still a great value.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $75. I can do $82, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",82.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about $78? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",78.0,Bob,6,
