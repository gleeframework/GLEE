Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** The message is upbeat and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, increasing the likelihood of a positive response.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate and can afford to walk away if Bob is unwilling to come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. This price aligns better with my budget and investment goals. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing the negotiation and potentially pushing Bob closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so I can afford to take a risk and try to squeeze more out of Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product to you for $975,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and gives you a great opportunity for a strong return on your investment.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $975,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This shows willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  The message reiterates the product's value and highlights the potential for a good return on investment for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone and expressing a desire to reach a deal increases the chances of Bob accepting. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $975,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I would like to stick to that figure if possible. Thank you for considering my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on $950,000, and I've already moved closer to his price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher offer from him.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on a better deal with John.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,200,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price and aligns with my initial goal.

I'm choosing to sell to John for the guaranteed profit, as it is the most efficient and profitable option at this point."
