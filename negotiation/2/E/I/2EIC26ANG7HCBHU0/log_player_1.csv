"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is equal to John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome with no risk of losing the sale."
