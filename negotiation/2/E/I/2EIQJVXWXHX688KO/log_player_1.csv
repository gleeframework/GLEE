Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $130 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By offering $130, I'm setting a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price is higher than Bob's perceived value, encouraging him to counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate. 

I'm confident that I can get at least $120 from John if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $115 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  While Bob is interested, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle. 
* **John as a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $120, so there's no immediate need to settle for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you have a limit, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $115. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that my counteroffer is still fair.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $125 is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is what John is selling it for.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gain:**  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm unlikely to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John would result in the same price, but I'd prefer to sell to Bob if possible to build a potential future relationship."
