"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top price.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you have a limit, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $125? I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $120, which is what John is selling it for.  Let me know if you're willing to go that low.",120.0,Bob,4,
