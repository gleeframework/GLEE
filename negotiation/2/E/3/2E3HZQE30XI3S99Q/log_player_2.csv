# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too close to your maximum price. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John for $10,000.  There's a chance to save some money by not immediately accepting Alice's first offer."
