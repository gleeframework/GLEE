Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it's a great deal, especially considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your backup option (John at $80). 
* **Not Being Greedy:**  While you could start higher, aiming for the middle ground increases the chances of Bob accepting immediately. A faster sale is generally better than risking no sale with Bob."
