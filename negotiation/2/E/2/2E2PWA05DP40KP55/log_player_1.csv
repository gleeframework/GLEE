Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $175. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good idea to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will tell you a lot about how much he values the product. If he readily accepts $175, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects the offer, you can always negotiate down or move on to John.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John willing to buy the product for $150, ensuring you won't be stuck with the product.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob interested."
