"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my maximum is $12000.  Let's try to find a compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $16000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you a price of $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16500 is still above what I can afford. I'm very serious about buying this product, and my highest offer is $14000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. ",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your commitment to finding a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's features and benefits. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15500 is still out of my budget.  With only a few rounds left, my final offer is $13500. If you're willing to come down to this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $13500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",14800.0,Alice,9,
