You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Here's how to break down the decision:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,450,000 
* **Bonus Value:** At least $250,000 (making the effective offer $1,200,000 or less)
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

**Analysis:**

While Alice's initial offer is high, the bonus she's added significantly changes the value proposition.  Since the bonus is worth at least $250,000 to you, it brings the effective cost down to your maximum budget.

**Decision:**

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product at your maximum budget *and* provides a substantial bonus. This is a better deal than purchasing from John at the same price without any additional benefits."
