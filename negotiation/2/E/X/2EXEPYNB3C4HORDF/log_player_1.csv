Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $95, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
