Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the deal.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, knowing Bob may counteroffer.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with maintaining a chance of reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating there's room for a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a solid backup with John's offer, giving me leverage to hold out for a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering, showing a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a position above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept the counteroffer.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer shows he's unlikely to go much higher, indicating a potential stalemate.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potentially a lower final price.

Given the situation, selling to John is the most financially advantageous decision, ensuring I receive the highest possible value for my product."
