Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $175 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher price for me, while still remaining within a range that might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. Accepting his offer ensures I don't lose out on the sale and still meet my minimum profit goal."
