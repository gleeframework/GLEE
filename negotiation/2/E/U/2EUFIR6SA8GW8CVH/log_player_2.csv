"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. We believe this is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is below the product's worth to you ($1,200,000), so it's a good starting point. However, you have room to negotiate further and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you might be able to negotiate a bit lower, it's not guaranteed.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price well below your maximum budget and significantly lower than John's offer. The risk of further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a higher price."
