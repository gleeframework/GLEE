"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $18000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16500.

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15000. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's meet at $16000. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
