Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible, while staying above our minimum ($120).
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John, so any offer to Bob must be more than that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.  

**Important Note:** While this is a starting point, observing Bob's reaction to this offer will be crucial to adapt our strategy and potentially negotiate further."
