"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $120? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can offer it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
