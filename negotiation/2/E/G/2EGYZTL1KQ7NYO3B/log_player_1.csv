Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation but still secures a profit for Alice. It also emphasizes the value to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is a decent profit, Alice can likely do better. Rejecting the offer allows her to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy. It's a fair compromise and secures a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $12,000.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether and being forced to sell to John at a lower price."
