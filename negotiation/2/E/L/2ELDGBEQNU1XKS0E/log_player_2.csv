Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500?  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a decent deal. What do you say?

How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!
