{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below my minimum of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? It's a fair price considering the current market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000 and even below what it's worth to him. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500?  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a decent deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering a compromise, hoping Bob will see the value in meeting halfway. This price is still above what the product is worth to him, but it's significantly closer to my minimum value and  allows for a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $6,500?  That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's closer to my minimum value. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a deal that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $6,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
``` 

I'm offering a final compromise. This price is still higher than Bob's last offer, but it's a significant step down from my previous counteroffer and gets us closer to a possible deal.  If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $7,500 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stay under $7,000.  How about we settle at $6,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, it's getting clear that we won't agree on a price that works for both of us. Rather than continuing to bargain and risking losing time and the possibility of a deal with John, I'm going to sell to John.  While it's not my ideal scenario, it's the best way to ensure I get my minimum value for the product."
