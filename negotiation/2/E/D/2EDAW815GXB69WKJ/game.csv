"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, considering my budget and its value to me.  Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a compromise. I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $900,000 remains below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise slightly and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair transaction for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but $950,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair compromise that demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring your product. Let's find common ground and seal this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  $925,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at least $940,000 to make this work. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit. If you're serious about this deal, let's find common ground at this price.",940000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $940,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $930,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?",930000.0,Bob,8,
