**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, considering my budget and its value to me.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $800,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. There are still rounds left, and I can always choose to buy from John for $800,000 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a compromise.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $900,000 remains below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise slightly and offer the product for $950,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair transaction for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still slightly above my budget, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. There are still several rounds remaining, and I believe there's potential for a mutually acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my budget."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but $950,000 is still a little too high for me.

```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer!  $925,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at least $940,000 to make this work. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit. If you're serious about this deal, let's find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000.
