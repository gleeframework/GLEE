"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,
