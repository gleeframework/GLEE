Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 than risk Alice sticking to her current offer."
