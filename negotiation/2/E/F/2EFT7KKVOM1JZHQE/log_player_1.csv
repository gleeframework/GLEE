Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $145. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 145 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or a potential ""take it or leave it"" scenario. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it at $145 positions the price as a ""deal"" while still securing you a significant profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John who will buy the product at your desired minimum, so there's less pressure to drastically lower the price for Bob."
