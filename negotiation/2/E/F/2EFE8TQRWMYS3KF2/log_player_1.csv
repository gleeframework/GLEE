{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Knowing your discerning eye for quality, I'm confident you'll recognize its worth. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so any offer accepted by Bob above that price is a win."
