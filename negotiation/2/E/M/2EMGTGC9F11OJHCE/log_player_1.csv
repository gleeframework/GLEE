Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $120 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit. If Bob counters, you can potentially meet in the middle and still get a great deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $80, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed."
