,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's the maximum I can afford. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a small concession, but $10200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10200 and $9000, which is $9600. Can we consider that?",9600.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9600. I'm willing to make another small concession. How about $10100?",10100.0,Alice,9,
