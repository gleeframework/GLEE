"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation higher and leaves room for concessions.  
* **Above Your Minimum:**  The initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but also leaves room to come down closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Gauge Bob's Reaction:**  This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's initial reaction and provide insight into his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his message attempts to establish common ground and appear reasonable, accepting this offer would leave a substantial amount of money on the table.  You know you have a guaranteed offer from John, so there's room to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your desire for savings, but your proposal significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this revised offer reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession, But Still Above Minimum:**  This counter-offer represents a $300,000 decrease from your initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, it remains significantly above both your minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** The message reinforces the product's value to Bob's business, subtly countering his focus on market value and budget.
* **Test the Waters:**  This counter-offer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to move substantially from his initial offer. His response will reveal more about his negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the $2,000,000 offer. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he is motivated to buy. However, he's still significantly under your minimum acceptable price. While his offer of $1,750,000 is getting closer, you know you have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  There's still room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer demonstrates serious interest, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair and mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counter-offer makes a smaller concession ($100,000) compared to the previous round, showing Bob you're reaching a limit.
* **Emphasize Fairness and Mutuality:** The message emphasizes finding a ""win-win"" solution, subtly reminding Bob that you're making compromises too.
* **Maintain a Buffer Above John's Offer:** The offer of $1,900,000 keeps a comfortable margin above John's guaranteed $1,500,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 

You're aiming to create a sense of urgency while still leaving yourself room to maneuver. Bob might be more willing to accept this offer believing it's close to your bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,900,000 offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While still below your initial target, Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is now a strong deal. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** You're securing a profit of $350,000 over your guaranteed offer from John.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** After six rounds, both parties are likely experiencing some negotiation fatigue.  Dragging it out further might not yield significantly better results. 
* **Bob's Commitment:** Bob's consistent increases in his offers demonstrate his strong interest in the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him walking away. 

It's always tempting to push for more, but accepting this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
