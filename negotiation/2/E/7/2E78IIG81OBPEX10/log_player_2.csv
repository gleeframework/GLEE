Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to wrap up the negotiation, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between $11,200 and your previous offer is relatively small. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiation falling apart and having to buy from John at the higher price."
