Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Aiming for $1,500,000 allows for a potential $300,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he finds the price too high, and you can always come down closer to your minimum if needed.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you haven't shared your minimum price with Bob.  It's a starting point for negotiation."
