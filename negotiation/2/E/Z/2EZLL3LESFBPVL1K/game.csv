"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair price for a product of this quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we try $10,000? That's a bit closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality.",10000.0,Bob,4,
