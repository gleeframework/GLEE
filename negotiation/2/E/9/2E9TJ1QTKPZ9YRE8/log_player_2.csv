It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $1,750,000 is above your maximum budget, and you can likely get a better deal."

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. There's still room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
