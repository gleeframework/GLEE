Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! $1,175,000 is a bit closer to my target, but I'm still not quite there.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, we still seem a bit far apart.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is a hard limit for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to close the deal. I can meet you at $1,200,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept it. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.
