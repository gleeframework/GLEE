"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10,800 is a bit too low for me at the moment.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11150.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,900 is still a bit low for me.  How about we try $11,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product, and I think it's a good price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm still not quite there with $10,950.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also recognizing your budget constraints. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,800, but I don't think I can go any higher. This is my final offer.",10800.0,Bob,8,
