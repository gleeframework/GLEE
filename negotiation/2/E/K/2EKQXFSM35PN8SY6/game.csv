"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
