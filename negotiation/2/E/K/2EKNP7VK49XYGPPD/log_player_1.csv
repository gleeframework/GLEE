Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than John's price and hopefully a more agreeable point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'd prefer to get a better price, it's getting close to John's offer, and I'm not sure I can get any higher with Bob. It's safer to sell to John and ensure a guaranteed $1,200,000."
