"Alice, thank you for the offer. While it's tempting, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I understand this product is worth a lot to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
