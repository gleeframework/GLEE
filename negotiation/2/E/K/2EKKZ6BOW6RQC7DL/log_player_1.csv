Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While it's tempting, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,000,000.  I understand this product is worth a lot to you, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
