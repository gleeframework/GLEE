"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its true value to me is much higher. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This leaves some room for profit for you, while still ensuring I get a fair deal. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000. It's a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
