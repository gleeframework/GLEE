Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum desired price. I will try to get closer to my target by counter-offering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my target, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This leaves some room for profit for you, while still ensuring I get a fair deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to accept it at this point.  I'll see if I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000, which is a significant concession on my part. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000. It's a good compromise for both of us. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and hasn't budged much from his original offer. I've made several concessions, but I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm better off selling to John for $1,000,000 and ensuring I get a fair price for the product."
