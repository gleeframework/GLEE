"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product will be worth much more than that to you in the long run. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still not quite there. I'm willing to drop the price to $10,800. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,
