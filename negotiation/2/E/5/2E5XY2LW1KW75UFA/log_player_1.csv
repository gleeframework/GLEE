"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($120), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives us room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive and focuses on the value Bob will get from the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I want to maximize my profit.  While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. This shows that I'm serious about getting my desired price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me a safety net if I can't reach a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the deal for both of us and highlights the product's worth. 
* **Show Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  However, I'm still not happy with this price, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I think there's still room for negotiation.  We've already been going back and forth, and I'm confident I can convince Bob to go a little higher.
* **John as Safety Net:**  John is still a reliable option if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $152?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 152} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  This offer is a small compromise from my previous one, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency:**  The message creates a sense of urgency by suggesting a final compromise to close the deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to remind Bob why this is a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my target. Would you be willing to come down to $148? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $148
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is just $2 below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While this is a good deal for him, it's not a good deal for me.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, I don't have much time to negotiate further.
* **John as Safety Net:** I can secure a better price with John, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
