"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with an ambitious offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This tactic achieves a few things:
    * **Anchoring:** It sets a high reference point for the negotiation. 
    * **Room to Negotiate:** It gives me ample space to make concessions during the rounds.
    * **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  His reaction to this initial price will offer valuable insight into his eagerness and potential flexibility. 

* **Positive Framing:** My message highlights the product's value and potential benefits for Bob, aiming to create a positive perception. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better deal. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for it just yet. 

I'll aim to meet Bob somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing $1,175,000. This reflects the product's inherent worth and potential for generating substantial returns."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial concession from my initial price, signaling my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Midpoint Tactic:** My new price is roughly the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This common negotiation tactic can help nudge the conversation towards a compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to highlight the product's value and potential for returns, aiming to justify the higher price point. 

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we can still negotiate further. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is definitely getting closer to my bottom line, but I'm still willing to push a little further.  He's increased his offer by $100,000, indicating serious interest. I'll make another strategic concession to signal that we're nearing a deal, but I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's bridge the gap - I'm proposing $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair and attractive price that reflects the significant potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, I'm reducing my asking price by a smaller amount ($50,000). This signals that I'm getting closer to my limit and encourages Bob to make a more significant move.
* **Focus on Agreement:**  I'm shifting the language to emphasize finding a mutually agreeable solution, reinforcing the collaborative spirit of the negotiation.
* **Final Push:** While I'm aiming for $1,100,000, this offer gives me a small buffer while still maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given your latest offer careful consideration, Alice. I believe we can come to an even better agreement. I am willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Above My Minimum:**  It's still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Offer:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or my asking price becoming unrealistic. This offer presents a good balance of risk and reward. 

It's time to close the deal and secure a profitable outcome."
