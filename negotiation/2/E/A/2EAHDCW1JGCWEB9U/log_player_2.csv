"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something incredibly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,100,000.  It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your ideal price, but it's closer.  Rejecting and counter-offering again leaves room for further negotiation and potentially a better deal.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a significant saving for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it's a price I can live with. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still slightly above what you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John.  Rejecting and counter-offering again allows you to try and push for a price closer to your budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
