Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a significant saving for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
