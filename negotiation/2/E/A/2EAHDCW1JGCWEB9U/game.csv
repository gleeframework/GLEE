"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something incredibly valuable, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1,100,000.  It's still a great price for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This would be a significant saving for you compared to selling to John, and it's a price I can comfortably afford.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it, and it's a price I can live with. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm happy to see we're making progress.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
