"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget, $850,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
