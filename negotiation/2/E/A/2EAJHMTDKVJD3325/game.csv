"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal for a product worth $150 to you.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $140 is closer, but I was hoping to be closer to $125. Would that work for you?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",135.0,Alice,5,
