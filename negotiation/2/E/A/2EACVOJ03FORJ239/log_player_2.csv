{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than my limit, but it's closer than before. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a final offer, as it's my maximum budget. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to consider purchasing from another seller."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While I've been able to negotiate a lower price, it's not enough to meet my financial constraints. To avoid further negotiation and potential delays, I will purchase the product from John for $1,000,000."
