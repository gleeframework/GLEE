{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what I know it's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired $150 minimum. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more. I'm also framing the offer as a compromise and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $150. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum. To ensure I get the best possible price, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
