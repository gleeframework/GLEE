"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1750000 is closer to my budget, I still feel there might be room for further discussion. Would it be possible to reach a price closer to $800000?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue this negotiation. However, $800000 remains too far below the product's true value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  $950000 is a significant improvement, but it's still not quite there.  I'm willing to go down to $1100000.
