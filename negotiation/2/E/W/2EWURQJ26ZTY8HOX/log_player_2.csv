"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's a significant discount from Alice's initial price. This shows that he's serious about negotiating and also provides some wiggle room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $12,250.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price, especially since he has the option of buying from John at $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum price. This shows Alice that he's serious about purchasing the product but is also committed to his budget. Since Bob has the alternative option of buying from John at $12,000, this offer signals that he's willing to walk away if a deal isn't reached at this price."
