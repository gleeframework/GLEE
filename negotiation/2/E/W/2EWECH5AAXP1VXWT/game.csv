"Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point better reflects the immense value it brings.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand you value the product highly, $2,000,000 is still a big stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a way to bridge the gap.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to move from your initial offer shows you see the value in this product. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
