"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this [Product Name] and I think it's a great fit for you.  I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since Alice is asking $150, the maximum you're willing to pay, it makes no sense to negotiate further. Buying from John at $150 ensures you get the product without any risk of going over your budget."
