"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $13,000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.",14250.0,Alice,5,
