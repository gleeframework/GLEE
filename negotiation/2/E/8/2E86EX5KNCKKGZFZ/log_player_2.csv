"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $13,000 is a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's target. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close, Bob. However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $14,000. I'm willing to meet you at $14,250. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also wants to buy the product.  At $14,250, he's saving $750 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer is the best option to ensure he gets the product at a price below his maximum threshold."
