"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price. This is a risky strategy, but if Bob is really interested, he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy, but I'll still have time to make a profit by selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to secure a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to keep negotiating with him.  I'm running out of rounds, so I'll need to be more aggressive with my counteroffers to try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still a good profit for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap to avoid selling to John at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm going to keep negotiating with him.  I'm starting to run out of time, so I'm going to have to be more aggressive with my counteroffers to try to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line.  If Bob doesn't accept this, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $10,000 lower than my bottom line. It's a small difference, and with only two rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a better price.  I'm going to accept his offer and secure the sale."
