Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
