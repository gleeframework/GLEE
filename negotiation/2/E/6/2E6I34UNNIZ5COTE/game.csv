"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $160. It's a fair price for a product that's worth $150 to you, and it's still a good deal for me. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to pay $150 for it, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",150.0,Bob,4,
