Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you get more than the $100 John offers. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it for the full $150 is risky as Bob might reject it outright. This price aims to secure a deal while still giving you a significant profit."
