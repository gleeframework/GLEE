``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you'd prefer to pay less, Alice's offer of $11,500 is still cheaper than John's $12,000.
* **You're willing to spend up to $12,000.** This means you're comfortable with Alice's price, even if it's not your absolute ideal. 

It's always a good strategy to accept a deal that's within your budget and better than your alternative options."
