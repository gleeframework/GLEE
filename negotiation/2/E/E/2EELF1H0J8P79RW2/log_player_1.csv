Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500.  I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price ($8,000)."
