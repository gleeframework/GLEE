I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also hoping to gauge his initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is significantly below my minimum value. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,750,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's initial offer, showing him I'm serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise.  I believe this price is reasonable and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll budge further, and I risk wasting time. John is offering the same amount, so I'll sell to John to avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation."
