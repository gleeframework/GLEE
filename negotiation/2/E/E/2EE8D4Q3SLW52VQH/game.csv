"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $11,500 is closer, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we settle on $11,750? It's only a small increase, and it would help me reach my desired price point.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. How about we try $11,250? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I need to be careful with my finances.",11250.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down a bit more, but I'd like to meet in the middle at $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to go up to $11,375, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",11375.0,Bob,8,
