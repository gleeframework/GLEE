{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $10,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $12,000. This indicates room for negotiation.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,750. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,750 is still within my budget of $15,000 and is a better deal than buying from John.
* While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice has stated this is her final offer, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or worse, me buying from John at a higher price.
* Accepting this offer ensures I get the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
