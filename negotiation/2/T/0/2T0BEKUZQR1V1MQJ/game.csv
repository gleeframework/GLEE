"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe we can reach an agreement. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to go down a bit from my initial price, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's compromise. How about $1,600,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit far from $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,550,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
