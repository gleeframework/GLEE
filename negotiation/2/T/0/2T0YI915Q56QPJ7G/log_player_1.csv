Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price considering its true value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate but still leaves room for you to earn a good profit.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for flexibility and room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **It's a clear message:**  The offer is concise and  sets the stage for a constructive negotiation. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. We'll see how Bob responds and proceed accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the product's true worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us move closer to reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting close to my minimum. Accepting this offer is the best decision in this scenario. It's a profitable deal for me and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely or having to deal with further negotiations."
