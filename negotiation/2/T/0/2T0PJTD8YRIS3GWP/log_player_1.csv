Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,150,000 is a fair reflection of that. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This is my best offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently moving upwards, indicating willingness to pay more. We're still in early rounds, and holding firm at this point might lead to a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To demonstrate my willingness to find a solution, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're meeting in the middle, showing a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above John's offer. This keeps the pressure on Bob while demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in reducing the price, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,085,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,085,000. While we could push for more, we're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($85,000 above John's offer) and avoids the risk of Bob dropping out in later rounds."
