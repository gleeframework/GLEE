"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. You might be able to get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she counters with a lower price."
