,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to offer $120, which is the most I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $150, but I'm still a bit short. I'd like to offer $135, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $135 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $145?  This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $140. Can you meet me at this price?",140.0,Bob,6,
