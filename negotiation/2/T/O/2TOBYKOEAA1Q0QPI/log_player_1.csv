Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay that amount.  

This strategy is based on the following logic:

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to earn the highest possible amount for the product.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a backup buyer, ensuring I don't lose out on the sale.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By offering the product at my minimum acceptable price, I put the pressure on Bob to accept the offer if he truly wants the product. 

This approach gives me the best chance to secure the full value of the product while still leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob is willing to pay a slightly higher price."
