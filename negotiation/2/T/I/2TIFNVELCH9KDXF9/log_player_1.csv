{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price that is higher than the product's worth to Bob but still within a reasonable range. This approach gives Bob room to negotiate and potentially accept the offer, while also ensuring that you start the negotiation with a price that is favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel there's room for negotiation. Could we meet somewhere closer to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
