Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than it is to me. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,350,000 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Highlight Value to Bob:**  By emphasizing that the product could be worth more to Bob, it justifies the high price and creates urgency for Bob to accept. 

This approach attempts to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
