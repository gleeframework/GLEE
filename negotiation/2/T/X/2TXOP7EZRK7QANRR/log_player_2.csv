Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering your asking price and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd prefer to pay less, $9,500 is a good price for a product worth $12,000 to you and $8,000 to Alice.  It's a fair deal for both of you, and you're saving $2,500 compared to buying from John."
