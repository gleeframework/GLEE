"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good price for you given your value of $12,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
