Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and further haggling may not yield much more.  $825,000 is a reasonable price and saves a substantial amount compared to John's offer."
