"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",825000.0,Alice,5,
