Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This means Alice doesn't have to settle for anything less than $1,200,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay beyond his valuation."
