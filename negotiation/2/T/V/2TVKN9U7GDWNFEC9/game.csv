"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a little high for me. How about $100? That would be a good compromise, and I'm sure we could both be happy with that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
