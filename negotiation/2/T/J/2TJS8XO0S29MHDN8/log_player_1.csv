Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and possibly accept a higher price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the phrasing implies a willingness to negotiate. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat motivated by scarcity and potentially open to negotiation. If you know Bob to be extremely price-sensitive, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer mitigates this risk."
