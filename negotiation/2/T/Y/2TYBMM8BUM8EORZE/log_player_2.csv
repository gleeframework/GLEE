"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties to collaborate. We're offering the product at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is valuable, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After evaluating your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $900,000. We believe this is a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is a compromise, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  He can continue to negotiate and potentially get closer to his target of $850,000 or lower.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again will give him another chance to find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget.  Let's meet at $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We've considered your proposal and are willing to accept $890,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects its value while staying competitive with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but $890,000 is still a bit high. He should continue negotiating and try to push Alice down to his desired price of $875,000 or even lower.  He has enough rounds remaining to continue negotiating without having to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but I really need to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}
