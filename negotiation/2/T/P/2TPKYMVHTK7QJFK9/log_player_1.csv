"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth more to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. It also sets a friendly tone, emphasizing mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now, as there's still potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I believe there's still potential to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,125.  Let's see if we can finally strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 9125}
