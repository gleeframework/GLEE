"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get a good price while also showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $110? It's a fair compromise that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? It's a small step down from your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for something closer to $110 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference? $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```

I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of his offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and should hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $102? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$102 is still a bit below my desired price, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to $107.50. There are only four rounds left, so I need to be cautious about accepting a price that's too low, as it could hurt my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $102 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $104? That would give us both a fair deal, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale today."", ""product_price"": 104}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's last offer, but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both agree on a price that's fair for both parties. We're running out of rounds, so I need to find a solution soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $101? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm getting close to making a decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $101
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob seems unwilling to budge further. While $101 is better than selling to John, it's still below my ideal price. With only two rounds left, I don't want to risk ending up with an even lower offer.  Selling to John guarantees me at least $80, which is more than my minimum."
