Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price higher than his perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or gives the impression of a higher inherent value.
* **Above Bob's value, below John's:**  The price of $125 is strategically placed above Bob's valuation but below John's guaranteed purchase price. This creates an incentive for Bob to potentially accept, as he might perceive it as a good deal, while still ensuring Alice earns more than her minimum acceptable price if he refuses.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer doesn't have to be a ""take it or leave it"" situation.  Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can decide to meet him somewhere in the middle. 

By starting with a strong but not unreasonable offer, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still leaving the door open for Bob to make a purchase."
