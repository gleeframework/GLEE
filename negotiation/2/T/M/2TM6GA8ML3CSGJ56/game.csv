"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,500 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle - how about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you consider $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. I understand you're aiming for $7,000, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a great deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
