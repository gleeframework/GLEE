"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Potential for Compromise:** $9,500 is a good starting point, allowing for potential compromise without sacrificing too much of my desired profit margin. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects the offer, but I'm also aware of my backup option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and also significantly lower than my initial offer of $9,500.  
* **Negotiation is Needed:**  I'm willing to negotiate, but Bob's initial counteroffer is too far off.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,500 is lower than I can accept, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle - how about $8,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.
* **Middle Ground:** $8,500 is a compromise price, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""still a good deal for you""). 
* **Maintaining My Value:**  $8,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, but allows for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining John as a Backup:**  I'm prepared to walk away if Bob continues to lowball, and John is a good fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000.  Would you consider $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $7,250 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  While Bob is getting closer, I'm not ready to settle for this price yet.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap a bit further. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail.  I have limited rounds left and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. I understand you're aiming for $7,000, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm demonstrating continued willingness to compromise by lowering my price again. 
* **Highlighting Fair Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** $8,000 is still within my acceptable range, while also moving closer to Bob's target.  
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm maintaining the option to sell to John, but I'm also showing Bob that I'm committed to closing the deal with him. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm aiming for a quick resolution that benefits both of us."
