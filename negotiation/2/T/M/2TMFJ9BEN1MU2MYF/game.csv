"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,500? This is a fair compromise and closer to my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your budget. However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $11,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, and if we can't agree, I'll have to go with another option.",9000.0,Bob,6,
