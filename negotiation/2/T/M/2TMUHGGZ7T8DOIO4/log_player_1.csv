Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** The offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), creating a space for potential negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to establish a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Gauge Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* **Prepare for Counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The presence of John provides a safety net, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  Accepting it would be a substantial loss for me.
* **I have a safety net with John.** Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price, which is far better than accepting Bob's offer.
* **I have room to negotiate further with Bob.**  While Bob's offer is low, I can still counter with a price closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise that benefits both parties. The presence of John as a potential buyer gives me the leverage to hold firm and negotiate effectively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to achieve a fair return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages a resolution.

**Strategy:**

* **Test the Waters:** This counteroffer tests Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Prepare for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I'll continue to keep the option of selling to John in mind, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  While it's closer than his initial offer, it's still not enough for me to accept.
* **I have a better option with John.**  Selling to John guarantees my desired price, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **There's still potential for negotiation.**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially reaching a compromise closer to $1,300,000.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired range. I will continue to use the potential sale to John as leverage to ensure a favorable outcome for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference at $1,250,000? This price is fair to both of us, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous counteroffer ($1,300,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,150,000).  This shows that I'm serious about finding a compromise.

* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message is positive and encouraging, aiming to create a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Negotiation:** This is likely my final counteroffer, as it's getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Prepare for Potential Rejection:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to sell to John for my minimum price.
* **Leverage John's Offer:**  The possibility of selling to John gives me the leverage to push for a price closer to my desired range.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a good price that's significantly closer to my desired range.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
