"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you know the product is worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I've already let you know the minimum price I'm willing to accept is $800,000. I'm not willing to budge from that. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at the minimum, so I'll make one final counteroffer: $810,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",810000.0,Alice,5,
