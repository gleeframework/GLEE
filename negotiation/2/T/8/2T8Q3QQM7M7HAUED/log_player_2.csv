"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $10,000 to you.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is still too high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,000.  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for me considering the product is worth $10,000 to me.  Accepting her offer saves me $1,000 compared to buying from John."
