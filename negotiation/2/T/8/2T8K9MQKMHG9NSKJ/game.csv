"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for your needs. My starting price is $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $60. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $130? I'm willing to be a bit flexible to make a deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still less than I'd like to get for the product.  How about $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
