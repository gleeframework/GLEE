"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, however, and am willing to pay $1500000. This is my top offer, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1600000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
