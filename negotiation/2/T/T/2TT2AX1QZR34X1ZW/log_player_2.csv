This represents a significant saving compared to its market value of $15,000, making it a great deal for you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John if necessary. This gives you leverage to negotiate with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to lower the price further, getting you a better deal."
