Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is too low for me, and I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to $120. How about $110? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $105. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $95.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob seems unwilling to budge on his price, and I'm not comfortable going any lower than $105.  John's offer is a safe bet and ensures I get my minimum price."
