,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to $120. How about $110? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $95.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $105. Let's make this deal happen.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $105 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $95.  Let's make this deal happen.",95.0,Bob,6,
