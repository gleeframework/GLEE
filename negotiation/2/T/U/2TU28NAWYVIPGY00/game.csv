"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. $6000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $7500? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $6500 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I need to be at $7000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",7000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $6800, which is the closest I can get to your final offer. Can you consider this?",6800.0,Bob,6,
