Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's true worth.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price. It makes more financial sense to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
