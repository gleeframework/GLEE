"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is far more than I'm willing to pay.  Given my research and the market value of similar products, I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's true worth.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a more accurate valuation while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,750,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my ability to pay. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
