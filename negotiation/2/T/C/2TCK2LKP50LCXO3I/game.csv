"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $10,000? It's the minimum I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",10000.0,Alice,5,
