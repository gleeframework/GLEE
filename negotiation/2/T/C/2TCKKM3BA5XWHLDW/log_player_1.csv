Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This is a good strategy because I can always lower the price later if necessary.  Bob might be willing to pay my minimum price, and if not, we can start negotiating from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could accept his offer, it's not in my best interest to sell at a loss. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price of $110.  This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial price but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept, as it's still a decent deal for him."
