Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves a good margin for Bob while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, given its value to him, and I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to him. It also gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to be unproductive.  $920,000 is significantly more than what I would get from John, and still leaves a good profit margin."
