"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium, and this gives us a good starting point for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise in the next round.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.  At this price, I'm still above my minimum, but I'm also acknowledging that I'm running out of rounds.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've made several concessions, but Bob is still unwilling to budge significantly. We're running out of rounds, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
