{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, making him more likely to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my target price, it's still not enough to justify risking further negotiation. John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is more than my minimum acceptable price. I'll sell to John."
