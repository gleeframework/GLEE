Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Therefore, there's a potential profit margin of $400,000.
* **Strong Opening Position:** Starting with a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer for $800,000 provides a safety net. Alice is not desperate and can afford to aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no way of knowing for certain Bob's maximum willingness to pay. If she had that information, she could adjust her offer accordingly."
