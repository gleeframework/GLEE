Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still above my minimum and a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
