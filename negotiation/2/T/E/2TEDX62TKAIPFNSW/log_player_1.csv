{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've stated that I'm open to negotiation to avoid appearing inflexible.
* **Positive Framing:** I've highlighted the product's potential value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Negotiate down:**  If Bob makes a counteroffer, I'll consider a price closer to his perceived value.
* **End negotiation and sell to John:** If Bob rejects my offer and I believe I can't get a better price, I'll sell to John to ensure I get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest in the product.
* **Maintaining value:**  Selling to John for $150 would ensure I get my minimum, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $100 and $150, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135. This would still allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $135. 
* **Fair Profit:** $135 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I make a reasonable profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and reiterating Bob's interest in the product to encourage him to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, the deal is done.
* **Further Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I'll need to reassess my options, considering if I should continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $135 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $120.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Close to acceptable:** While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's not quite there yet, and I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go. 
* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a better price, as Bob has shown a willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $115 and $150, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to work with him. 
* **Sell to John if necessary:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will likely sell to John to ensure I get my minimum value."

**Reasoning:**
