"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. I'm aware that this might seem too high for Bob, but it allows for some room to adjust the price in later rounds.  I'm also factoring in the possibility of going to John as a backup option if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it, and I believe I can get closer to my target.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's also closer to my desired price, but I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider but still leaves room for me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price.  I think I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm considering going to John if the next couple of rounds don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000, which is my minimum price.  It's a significant compromise from my previous offers, showing a willingness to be reasonable.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob doesn't seem willing to meet my minimum price.  I'd rather take the sure $10,000 from John than risk getting a worse deal from Bob in the remaining rounds."
