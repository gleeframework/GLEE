"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $725,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your initial offer and the product's worth to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $725,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $685,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",685000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but $685,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $700,000. This is a fair price, taking into account your willingness to pay $685,000 and the product's worth to you.",700000.0,Alice,5,
