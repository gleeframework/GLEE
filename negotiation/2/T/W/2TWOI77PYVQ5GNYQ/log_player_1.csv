{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000. It's a great deal considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $14,000 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation but still reflects the product's value to me. 
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message creates a positive atmosphere and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting value:**  Mentioning the product's value to Bob subtly emphasizes its worth and justifies the price.

This offer allows me to potentially secure a higher price while keeping the negotiation open for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500,  which is still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for higher price:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John for $12,000 is my last resort. I want to explore options with Bob first to see if we can reach a more favorable deal. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation open and try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would still be a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  Offering $13,250 represents a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my desired profit margin.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone strengthens the negotiation dynamic and increases the likelihood of a successful outcome. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Reminding Bob about the product's value reinforces the justification for the proposed price.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually acceptable price point while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
