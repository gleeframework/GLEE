"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a good price for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1100000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1200000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
