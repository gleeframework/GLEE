"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1500000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a good price for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1200000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, I'm not confident we can reach a deal that meets my minimum price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I'd rather not risk a lower price or further negotiation."
