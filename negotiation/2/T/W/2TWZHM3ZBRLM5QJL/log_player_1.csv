"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is still too low for me. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a good price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $80? I'm willing to pay that much for the product. It's the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer is the best choice as it allows me to sell the product for my desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiations that might result in a lower price or a failed sale.  Selling to John for $80 would be equally profitable, but it's not clear if there's a chance to get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds."
