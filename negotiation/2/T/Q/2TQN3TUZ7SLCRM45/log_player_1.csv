Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also sets a starting point and allows for a friendly conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum threshold of $100. It's better to try and negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I need to cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $87 is closer to my minimum, I've already engaged in multiple rounds of negotiation. It's becoming clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. To maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $100."
