# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our previous discussions, I am willing to agree upon a price of $925,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

While we could try to push Alice further,  $925,000 is a significant reduction from her initial offer.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking John changing his mind or another buyer scooping up the product isn't worth the potential savings at this point."
