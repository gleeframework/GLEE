"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,100,000 is slightly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my minimum price. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still slightly out of my price range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to meet my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1,090,000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the sale at this price.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
