"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
