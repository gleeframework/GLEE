"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to go as high as $800000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1200000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900000. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $900000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1100000. This is a significant compromise from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
