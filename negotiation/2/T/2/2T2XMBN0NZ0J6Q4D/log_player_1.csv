Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations slightly above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Justification:** Mentioning the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" subtly reinforces its worth to Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is high, it's not so high as to be insulting.  It recognizes that the product is worth significantly more to Bob than your minimum. 
* **Alternative:** You have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so any offer Bob makes below that is not worth considering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's significant room for negotiation.  You can afford to reject this lowball offer and propose a counteroffer closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. While I appreciate your interest, $750,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $875,000.  This reflects its worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:**  You clearly reject Bob's initial offer and reiterate the product's value.
* **Significant Movement:** You've come down $50,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but not at the expense of a fair price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price point well above your guaranteed sale to John ($800,000), leaving room for further negotiation while still aiming for a price closer to your initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your guaranteed sale price with John. While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
