"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  There's no point in buying from Alice at the same price as John.  By rejecting, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is a substantial discount from the original price and puts pressure on Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob still has room for negotiation. He can aim for a price closer to his ideal range.  By rejecting, he keeps the negotiation open and maintains leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still seeking a price lower than Alice's latest offer. $11,000 is a good compromise, making it more likely that Alice will accept."
