,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $950000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
