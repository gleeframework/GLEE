Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I'm not giving away too much initially.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm phrasing the message as a conversation starter, inviting Bob to discuss the price and potentially negotiate. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:**  The existence of John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. Bob knows that I have other options, making him more likely to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $850000. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. 
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so there's no need to settle for a lower price unless Bob comes closer to my expectations.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired point to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but still staying above Bob's initial offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $950,000 is a fair price.
* **Setting a Limit:** This price is closer to my desired selling point, but still leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or a stalemate. 
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and energy, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale altogether. It's a good compromise that gets me closer to my goal."
