Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,300,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still offering Bob a price that's $200,000 less than his perceived value. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
