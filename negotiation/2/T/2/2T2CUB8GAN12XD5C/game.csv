"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with $15,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
