,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $100.  That's a fair price, and it's still below what the product is worth to you.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can go as high as $100. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
