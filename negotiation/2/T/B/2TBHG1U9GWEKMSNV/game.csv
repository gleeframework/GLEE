"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,800. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and our previous discussions. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",11800.0,Bob,4,
