"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I mention the product's value to him ($15,000) to emphasize the potential bargain.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not aiming for a final deal in the first round, but rather starting a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Even though Bob is willing to pay more than John, I can still aim for a better price. There are 8 rounds remaining, and I can use that leverage to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **Not rushing the deal:** Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking for something closer to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you considering the value it holds. Let's work towards a price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far below my minimum price. This shows willingness to negotiate but still protects my interests.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's worth to Bob to justify my price.
* **Finding common ground:** I emphasize a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $11,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm trying to be fair, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $10,000.
* **Room for improvement:** I have 6 rounds remaining, and there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $10,000 is safe, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to continue negotiations with you while still meeting my minimum requirements. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:**  I'm now only $500 away from Bob's offer and $500 above my minimum price, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm using the phrase ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Creating urgency:**  Mentioning that $10,500 allows me to continue negotiations creates a sense of urgency for Bob, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to 4 rounds, and there's a good chance we won't reach an agreement with Bob before time runs out.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price. While it's not the ideal scenario, it's the safest option given the current circumstances. 

I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed sale over potentially continuing negotiations that may not lead to a successful outcome."
