Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Potential for higher profit:** I want to maximize my earnings.  If Bob is willing to pay more than $12,000, I'll gain extra profit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, I'm confident that $15,000 is a fair price that he might consider, especially if he values the product highly.

By offering a higher price, I'm creating a good balance between potential profit and the possibility of securing a deal with Bob."
