"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is fair considering the value of the product to me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
