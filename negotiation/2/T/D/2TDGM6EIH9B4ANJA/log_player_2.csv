"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to propose $1,050,000. I believe this is fair considering the value of the product to me and your potential profit margin. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than John's price of $1,200,000.  There's a chance Bob could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and needing to buy from John outweighs the potential savings."
