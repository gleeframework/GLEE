"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

While Alice's offer is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more than your maximum budget and more expensive than John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you can leverage the standing offer from John and secure a better price."
