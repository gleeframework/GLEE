"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we meet at $1325000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 6-month warranty and dedicated support. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
