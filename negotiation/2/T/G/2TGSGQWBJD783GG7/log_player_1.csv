Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially make concessions, but I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $100, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still aiming to get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counter-offering Bob at $135. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between our last offers.  I hope this will be enough to secure the deal, but I'm still prepared to walk away if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is clearly willing to pay close to my desired price. While I'd love to push for $135, accepting his offer of $132 is the best option.  It ensures a sale that's significantly better than selling to John and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential delays."
