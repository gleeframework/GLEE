"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has other options.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $13000.  This still gives me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should still reject the offer. While $13,000 is closer to his target, he can still try to get it for less or buy from John for $12,000.  He has more negotiating power since Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,000 is closer to what I can do,  I'm still only able to pay $12,500. This is a fair compromise and would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
