"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $12000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $12000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $13000.  This still gives me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to what I can do,  I'm still only able to pay $12500. This is a fair compromise and would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,4,
