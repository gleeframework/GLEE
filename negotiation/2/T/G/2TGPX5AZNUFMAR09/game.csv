"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about I offer $850,000 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a fair deal for you. I hope this proposal works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This would still allow you to make a good profit, while also giving me a fair return on my investment.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is closer than previous offers, I still feel it's a bit high given my budget constraints. Could you consider coming down to $860,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",860000.0,Bob,4,
