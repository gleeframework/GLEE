"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is more than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to establish a good rapport with Bob. This is important for potential future negotiations. 

Let's see if Bob accepts my offer. If not, we'll adjust our strategy for the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $70 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Selling to John at this point would be a better outcome.
* **Negotiation potential:** However, Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate.  There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round to try and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and my desired price. This demonstrates good faith and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining value:** $85 is still significantly higher than what John is offering, so it's a good deal for me. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to get a better offer from him, and it's the same price as John is offering.
* **No need to risk it:** There's no point in continuing to negotiate. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids any risk of further negotiation failing. 

This deal achieves my goal of selling the product for at least $80."
