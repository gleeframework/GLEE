Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I respect that.  To be honest, I have to be pretty mindful of my budget. How about we make it a straight split of the difference - $1,095,000? That's my best offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,095,000 is a significant profit above our minimum ($1,000,000) and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
