**Reasoning:**  Alice is not budging significantly on price. Her counteroffers suggest she's unwilling to go much lower than $1,000,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price I'm willing to pay. John's offer of $800,000 is my upper limit, and securing the product at that price makes more sense than potentially drawn-out negotiations with Alice."
