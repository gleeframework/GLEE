"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000,  Bob can potentially get the product for even less by making a counteroffer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering its worth $15,000 to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price compared to the initial $12,000, it's still above his preferred budget. Bob can try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm  firmly set on $10,000.  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $10,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its worth $15,000 to me. Let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has a clear goal of spending no more than $8,000.  Alice's final offer of $10,800 exceeds that limit. While the price is getting closer, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice. It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he meets his budget."
