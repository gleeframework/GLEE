{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great deal for its value. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Explanation: Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay ($150).  Since I have another buyer (John) willing to pay the same amount, there's no point in further negotiation. I'll sell it to John."
