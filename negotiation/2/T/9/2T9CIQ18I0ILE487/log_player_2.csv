Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9750. This is the closest I'm willing to get to your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly in price, her offer is still above my budget. It's clear that we're not going to close the deal at a price I'm comfortable with, and it's only getting harder to get her to compromise further. To avoid risking losing more time and potentially ending up paying more, I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees I get the product within my budget and saves me the hassle of further negotiation."
