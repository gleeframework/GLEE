"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product,  $15000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because my minimum is $12,000 and I want to see if I can get more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I want to explore the possibility of a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,000. This is a good compromise, and it's above my minimum price of $12,000. I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer, especially since I have already rejected two of his offers."
