"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,500 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
