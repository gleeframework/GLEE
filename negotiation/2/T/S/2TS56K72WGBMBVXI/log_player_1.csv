Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $13,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I've priced it slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to maximize my profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further, but always keeping in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't afford $13000 at this time. Would you consider reducing the price to $12000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob's offer is the minimum I am willing to accept, I will take it.  There's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
