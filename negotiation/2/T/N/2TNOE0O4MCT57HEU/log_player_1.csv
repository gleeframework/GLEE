Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, so there's room to push further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob is signaling this is his best offer, and while there are rounds left, he might not be bluffing. Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** $1,850,000 is a significant profit, even if it's less than initially hoped for.
* **Rejecting:** Risks angering Bob and potentially losing the sale. Even a counteroffer close to his might be rejected now.
* **John:** The ""safe"" option, guarantees $1,500,000, but leaves potential profit on the table.

Since Bob used the phrase ""final offer,"" the risk of pushing him further is high. It's likely better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him.
