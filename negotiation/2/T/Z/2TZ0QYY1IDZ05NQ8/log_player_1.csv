Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $9000.  I'm confident this price is fair considering my own valuation and the value it brings to me.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
