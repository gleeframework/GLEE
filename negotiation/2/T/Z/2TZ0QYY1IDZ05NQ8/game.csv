"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. To make this work, I'd be willing to pay $9000.  I'm confident this price is fair considering my own valuation and the value it brings to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9500.  This represents a significant step toward your original price and would make this deal worthwhile for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $11000. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a solution.  $11000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9750. This is a good middle ground, considering the value of the product to me and your original asking price. It shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, but it's also the highest I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can make this work.",9750.0,Bob,6,
