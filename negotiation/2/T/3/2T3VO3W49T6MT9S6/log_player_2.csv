"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed $1,200,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice down to your desired price range."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to $1,200,000. You might be able to convince Alice to drop her price further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1320000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,320,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and it's unclear if Alice will budge further.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for your maximum budget, it's the safest and most efficient decision to go with John."
