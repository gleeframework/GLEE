Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's potential for a higher sale price.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance to offer Bob the product.

**Strategy**

The optimal strategy is to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases your chances of closing the deal.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message starts strong, highlighting the exclusivity of the opportunity.
* **Value Justification:**  You're not just mentioning a price; you're framing it with ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential returns,"" subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,450,000 is just below Bob's $1,500,000 valuation, giving him a strong incentive to accept while maximizing your profit.

**Important Note:** While this offer is likely to be successful, negotiation is complex.  Bob could counter-offer or still reject the proposal."
