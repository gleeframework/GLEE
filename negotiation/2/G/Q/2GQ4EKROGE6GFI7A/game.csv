"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",110.0,Alice,3,

I understand that $110 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? I'm really interested in the product and I think this price would be more reasonable for me.,105.0,Bob,4,
