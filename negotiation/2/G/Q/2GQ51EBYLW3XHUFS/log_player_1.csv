{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. By offering $12,000, I'm showing Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I value the product.  This should encourage him to counter-offer, giving me a chance to further negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit higher than my target price, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $11,000 is close enough to my desired range. It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm happy to accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
