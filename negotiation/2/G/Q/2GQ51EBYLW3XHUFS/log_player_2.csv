"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get the price down closer to your $10,000 limit."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?

It's still worth trying to negotiate a little more. You're very close to your price limit and might be able to squeeze out an extra $500 or so."
