"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to earn a fair amount for my product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground here. While I appreciate your offer, I'm simply not willing to go below $9,000.  That price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me there, I might have to consider other options.",9000.0,Alice,5,
