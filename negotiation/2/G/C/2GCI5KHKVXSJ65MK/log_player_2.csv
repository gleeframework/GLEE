Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

It's better to buy from John at $15,000 than to risk getting stuck with a price you can't afford from Alice."
