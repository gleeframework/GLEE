"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will surely impress. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price.  However, I'm looking to invest a bit less.  Would you consider $950,000?  It's a fair price given my valuation and allows us both to close a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit while also giving you a good deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than her previous offer, but it's still above Bob's target price.  He can likely get it for less by continuing the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $950,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer you $1,050,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his budget.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's more advantageous for him to end the negotiation with Alice and purchase it from John.  This ensures that Bob gets the product at his target price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
