It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that will surely impress. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price.  However, I'm looking to invest a bit less.  Would you consider $950,000?  It's a fair price given my valuation and allows us both to close a deal.
