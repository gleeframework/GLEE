Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's valuation of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still allows me to make a decent profit. 
* This initial offer creates a clear point of negotiation and incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* I'm not starting too high ($15,000) because that would likely scare Bob away immediately.
* I'm leaving room for negotiation, so I'm not risking losing out to John just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000.  Selling to John guarantees my desired profit, so it's not worth accepting Bob's offer at this stage. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500** represents a compromise. It's significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but it's still higher than Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* This counteroffer signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling to him but also that I won't settle for a price drastically lower than my initial offer. 
* I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired $15,000, but also acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more than his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it is still significantly lower than my desired price of $15,000. With each round of negotiation, it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further. Given that John is willing to pay my desired price, it's more strategically sound to sell to John and guarantee my profit. Further negotiation with Bob at this point seems unlikely to lead to a significantly higher price."
