Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  I think this price reflects the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $160. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm concerned that we're still too far apart in price and we are already halfway through the rounds.  John offers a guaranteed price of $150, which is my minimum and secures me a good deal without the risk of further negotiation."
