"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is good,  $800,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $700,000. This is still a significant discount from the initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm going to make a counteroffer of $650,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
