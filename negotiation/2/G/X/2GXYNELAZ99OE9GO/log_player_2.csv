# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $130. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $80. There's room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can get a lower price."

$120 is still higher than what you're willing to pay, but it's closer to Alice's bottom line. Let's try to meet in the middle."
