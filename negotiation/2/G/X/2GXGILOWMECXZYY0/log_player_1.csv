Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $115 is more than your minimum price of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's space for him to counteroffer and still find a price that works for both of you. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A very high opening offer could make Bob walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is closer to your minimum, there's still room to negotiate for a better price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're willing to continue negotiating, which could lead to a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down a little bit, but $112 is my best price.  It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $108 is just above your minimum of $100 and you've already rejected a lower price.  It's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a lower price, so it's best to accept this offer and avoid any further risk of losing the sale."
