"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Since Bob has the option of buying from John for $800,000, he has leverage in this negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $1,100,000 is still above Bob's comfortable range.  Rejecting the offer again allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially getting closer to his desired $800,000 target.  He can also  consider increasing his offer slightly from his previous counteroffer to show willingness to negotiate while still being within his budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to the product's true value. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for Bob.  He has already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected them.  Given that Bob has the option of buying the product from John for $800,000, it is in his best interest to buy from John and avoid further negotiations with Alice. This will save him $250,000 compared to Alice's current offer."
