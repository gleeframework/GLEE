Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value of $100. I want to leave room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more. I still have a few rounds left and I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $90 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $87. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations are getting a bit tedious, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've got a sure thing with John at $100, so I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John."
