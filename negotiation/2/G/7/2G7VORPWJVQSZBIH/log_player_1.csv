**Reasoning:** Bob seems anchored at $862,500 and unlikely to budge significantly.  While $862,500 is a good price, I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, which might not yield a better outcome."
