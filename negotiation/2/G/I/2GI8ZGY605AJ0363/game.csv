"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price given the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,000,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, which was $1,200,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,300,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
