"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before reaching your $800,000 walk-away point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a substantial discount.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $650,000, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower benchmark for future counteroffers.
* **Maintaining Politeness:**  It's important to remain polite and respectful throughout the negotiation, even when making a low counteroffer. This helps maintain a positive relationship and keeps the door open for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which still leaves a good margin for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Reasoning:** Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on the deal, especially since you have the option to buy from John at the same price."
