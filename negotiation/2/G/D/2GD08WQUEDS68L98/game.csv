"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering my current needs and limitations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for the product's unique features and benefits.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and is a fair price considering my needs and the value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $975,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value and quality.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $975,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your latest proposal.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $975,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
