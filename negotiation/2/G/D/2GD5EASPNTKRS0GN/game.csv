"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair deal considering the market value.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000? I feel this represents a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is cutting it too close.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, but I do have other opportunities to consider.  My best offer is $850,000.  This is a fair deal given the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
