Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price that captures a significant portion of the value difference ($1,000,000 - $800,000 = $200,000).
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering at $925,000 leaves Bob with a potential $75,000 gain while netting you a $125,000 profit over your minimum. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to be prepared to negotiate further."
