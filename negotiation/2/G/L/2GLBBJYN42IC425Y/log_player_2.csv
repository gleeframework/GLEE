"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, you can likely get it for even less by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $105. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! Thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $105, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $112.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $112.50 is still better than John's price of $120, and closer to your desired price of $105. It's a good deal, so accept it."
