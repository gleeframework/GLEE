Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value, giving him a reason to negotiate, but it's also below your minimum acceptable price, allowing room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** It highlights the product's value to Bob and emphasizes the potential for a good deal. 
* **The offer is clear and concise:** It states the price directly and avoids any ambiguity. 

This approach balances the need to maximize your profit with the possibility of securing a sale with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you have a backup option with John, ensuring you don't lose out on your desired minimum."
