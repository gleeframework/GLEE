"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. Let's make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
