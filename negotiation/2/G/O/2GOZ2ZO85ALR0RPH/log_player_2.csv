"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still getting the product. 
* **Alice's offer:** $90 is higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay ($100).
* **Rejecting makes sense:** Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  I'm very interested in this product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of 85, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 87.50. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $87.50 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant discount from the initial $90 offer. 
* **Accepting is the best option:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible, or he might run out of rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
