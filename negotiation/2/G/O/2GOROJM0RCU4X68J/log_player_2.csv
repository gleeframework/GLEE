# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs.

Round 2

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to present a counteroffer that I hope will be more agreeable to both parties. Given the value you place on our product, I propose we set the price at $1,100,000. This offer aims to bridge the gap while still reflecting the product's worth to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
