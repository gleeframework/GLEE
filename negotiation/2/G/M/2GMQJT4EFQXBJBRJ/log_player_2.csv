"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be a worthwhile one. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1200000, so I'm confident this is a good opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is slightly higher than John's,  it's still within Bob's budget.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can force Alice to lower her price or risk losing the sale to John.  This strategy gives Bob a chance to get the product for a lower price than $1,200,000."
