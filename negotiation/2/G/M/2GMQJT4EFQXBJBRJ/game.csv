"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I understand it's a significant investment, but I believe it will be a worthwhile one. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1200000, so I'm confident this is a good opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
