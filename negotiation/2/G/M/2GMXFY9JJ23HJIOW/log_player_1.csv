"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to risk further negotiation rounds with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $110 is still too low. I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  Selling to John at this point would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $110 just doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference. How about $125? It's a fair price, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult.  Bob's latest offer of $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While there are still a few rounds left, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk further negotiation rounds that could lead to an even lower offer from Bob. Selling to John guarantees me a profit and eliminates any further risk of losing out on a better deal."
