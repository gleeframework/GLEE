"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $160, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $160 is far too high for him, and he can get the same product from John for $100.  It makes sense to counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $160 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $160 was a starting point, but I'm willing to come down to $140. That's a fair offer considering the quality of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $140 is lower than her initial price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $100, making it more beneficial to counteroffer Alice again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 110}
