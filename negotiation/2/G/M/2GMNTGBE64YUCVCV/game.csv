,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is $15000. I'd be willing to close the deal right now if you're open to that price.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18000 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be open to $16500? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $17000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to your business.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I truly appreciate your flexibility.  While $17000 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched. Would you consider $16000 as a final offer? I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $16500, which is my absolute minimum. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal.",16500.0,Alice,7,
