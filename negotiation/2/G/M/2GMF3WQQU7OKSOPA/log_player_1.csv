Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $18,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. This is intended to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message also includes a question to invite Bob to engage in a negotiation. 

This is a strategic opening offer. I am willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is better than my minimum of $12,000, I'm not satisfied with this offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $14,000 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to $16,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? This product is truly exceptional, and I believe this price reflects its value."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Instead of completely rejecting Bob's offer, I'm proposing a compromise by meeting him halfway at $16,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not giving in too quickly.  This keeps me in a strong position. 

This counteroffer is a strategic move to try and find a price point that works for both of us without resorting to another round of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $14,500 is getting closer to my desired price. While it's not ideal, it's significantly higher than John's offer of $12,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation.  There's always a risk that I could push for a slightly higher price, but I'm confident that $14,500 is a reasonable compromise considering the potential of further negotiations."
