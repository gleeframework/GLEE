"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? This would still give you a great deal, and it's fair to me. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  While $125 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you maybe do $95? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer!  $95 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price.",100.0,Bob,6,
