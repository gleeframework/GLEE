Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss. If Bob counters, you can negotiate down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is covered by John's offer.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the initial offer."
