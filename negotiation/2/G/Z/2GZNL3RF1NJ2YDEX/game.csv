"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
