Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between $9,250 and $9,000 isn't significant enough to risk losing the deal.  It's a good price compared to John's offer."
