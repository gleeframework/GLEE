"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to settle at that?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $9,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,5,
