{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget of $120. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm able to go right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping we can find a way to make this work.  Would you be willing to meet me at $130?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're finding a middle ground. Considering your offer, I'd like to suggest $132 as a fair price for the product. This allows us to both benefit from the transaction. I hope you find this proposal acceptable! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget. While $132 is better than her previous offers, it's still not a great deal for me.  I'm willing to walk away and buy from John. The extra $12 is worth it to me to avoid further negotiation."
