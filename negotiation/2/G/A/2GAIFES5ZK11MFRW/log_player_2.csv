Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $850,000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above my target price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more by continuing to negotiate. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $875,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is very close to my target price and represents a significant discount from her initial offer. It's within my budget and likely the best deal I'll get.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will stick to her final offer, and I'll end up paying more by going to John.  It's time to close the deal."
