"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $17,000 is a bit steep given my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
