"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still allowing us both to benefit from the transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is thoughtful, the $1,300,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the full scope of what's being offered.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,800,000. This allows me to make concessions while ensuring the deal remains beneficial for both parties.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still too far from my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value and allows us to both reach an agreement. Let's try to find common ground and close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is a significant investment, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal. Let's reach an agreement and avoid having to go through more negotiation rounds.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
