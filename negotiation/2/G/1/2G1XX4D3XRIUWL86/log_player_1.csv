"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong anchoring point significantly above both our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression of the product's high value. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""immense value and potential"" and ""true worth in the market,"" we aim to influence Bob's perception and justify the high starting price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still allowing us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). We have plenty of rounds left for negotiation, and John's offer guarantees our minimum. Therefore, we'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer in the next round to guide the price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is thoughtful, the $1,300,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the full scope of what's being offered.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,800,000. This allows me to make concessions while ensuring the deal remains beneficial for both parties."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** We start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and appreciating his understanding of the product's value. This helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Strategic Concession:** We make a significant concession from our initial $2,000,000 ask, dropping to $1,800,000. This signals our willingness to negotiate but still keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We emphasize finding a ""middle ground"" and a deal that's ""beneficial for both parties."" This framing reinforces the idea that we're working towards a mutually agreeable outcome. 

We are strategically moving towards our target price while gauging Bob's flexibility. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still too far from my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value and allows us to both reach an agreement. Let's try to find common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, now at $1,400,000.  While closer to our $1,500,000 minimum, we still have room to negotiate and leverage our fallback option (selling to John). We'll reject this offer to see if we can push Bob a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is a significant investment, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** We acknowledge Bob's efforts and convey a desire to find a solution. We significantly decrease our ask to $1,650,000, emphasizing this as a substantial concession and our final offer.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value while highlighting our flexibility to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts us in a strong position. It's above our minimum but leaves Bob with a difficult decision: accept a price higher than he initially intended or risk losing the deal entirely.

This approach aims to apply a bit of pressure while still maintaining a collaborative tone. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal. Let's reach an agreement and avoid having to go through more negotiation rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There is no strategic advantage to continuing the negotiation. Accepting this offer secures the best possible outcome for us at this point."
