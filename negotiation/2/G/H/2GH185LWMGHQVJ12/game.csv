"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could you do $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
