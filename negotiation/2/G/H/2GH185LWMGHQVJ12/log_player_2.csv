Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the minimum I'm willing to accept.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  A price of $1,050,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice altogether."
