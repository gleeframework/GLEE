Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting.  Here's why:

* **Profit:** I'm aiming for a profit of $2,000, which is a good chunk of change.
* **Bob's Incentive:** Bob still gets a good deal, saving $1,000 compared to his perceived value. This makes it likely he'll accept.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and make a decent profit."
