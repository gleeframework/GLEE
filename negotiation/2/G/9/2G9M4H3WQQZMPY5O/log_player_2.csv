Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to get the best price.  You can likely negotiate further with Alice.  Rejecting and countering allows you to get closer to your goal price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $8900 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal. Let's close this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You've reached a point where Alice is only willing to come down to $8,900, which is still more than what you're willing to pay.  Since John offers the product for $8,000, it's more beneficial to buy from John at this point."
