Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you have other interested buyers, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $18,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue pushing for a higher price, Bob seems firm at $18,000. Accepting this offer provides a $3,000 profit over selling to John. Continuing negotiations risks losing Bob without a guarantee of a better outcome."
