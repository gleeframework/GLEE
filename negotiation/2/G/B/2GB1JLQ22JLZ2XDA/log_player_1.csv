Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering the product at $20,000, you signal that you're open to discussion while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
