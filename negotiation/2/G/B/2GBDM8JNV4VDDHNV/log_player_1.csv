Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently moving down in increments of $25,000. This indicates he likely has a much higher valuation than he's letting on and is trying to get the best deal possible. We're still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Holding firm for a few more rounds might incentivize Bob to come closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my final offer is $1,125,000.  This product has the potential to significantly impact your business, and I'm confident you'll see incredible returns. This is a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** It's time to send a strong signal that we're reaching our limit.  Keeping the offer firm at $1,125,000 for two rounds makes it clear this is non-negotiable.
* **Finality:** Stating it's our ""final offer"" adds weight and might prompt Bob to reconsider pushing further down. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  We reiterate the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of the potential gains, hoping to justify the price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,000,000 is a strong offer, exceeding our minimum by $200,000. It represents a significant profit.
* **Bob's Limit:**  Bob's language (""one last concession,"" ""need to make sure it's a good deal"") suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Pushing further risks losing Bob entirely. We're in the late stages of negotiation, and securing a sure $1,000,000 outweighs the possibility of getting slightly more, especially with John's backup offer."
