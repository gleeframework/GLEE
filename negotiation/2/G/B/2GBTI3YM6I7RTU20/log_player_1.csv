"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me the best chance of maximizing profit.  It's important to remember that Bob's valuation is unknown, so this initial offer is a gamble.  I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John, so I won't be afraid to make concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $1,500,000, especially with 8 rounds remaining to get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not desperate. It leaves some room for negotiation while still protecting my minimum value.  I'm trying to find a price point that balances my need for profit with the need to make a deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. It's barely above his previous offer, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'm confident that I can get a better price, especially with 6 rounds remaining. I will reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession, but I believe it shows Bob that I am serious about closing a deal. I'm hoping he will see the value in this offer, as it is still a good price for me. If he doesn't accept, I will have to decide if I'm willing to risk losing a deal altogether to hold out for a higher price with fewer rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. He's only increasing his price by a small amount each round. It's frustrating, but I'm not going to give up on getting a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm starting to run out of time, but I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm dropping the price to my minimum value of $1,500,000.  This is a final offer. If Bob doesn't accept, I will sell the product to John.  It's a risky move, but I'm running out of time. This gives Bob one last chance to accept a price that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a difficult decision, but with only two rounds left and Bob's offer still significantly lower than my minimum, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000. It's not ideal, but it guarantees I don't lose money and allows me to exit the negotiation with Bob without further risk."
