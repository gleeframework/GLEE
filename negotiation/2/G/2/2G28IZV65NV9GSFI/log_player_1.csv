**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently moving towards his valuation, but he's still significantly below my minimum.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to walk away to secure a better deal."

{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been trying to find a compromise here, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to drop to $900,000, but this is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."",

* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding him of the product's value, hoping he'll budge further.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" implies I'm ready to walk away and sell to John for my desired price."
