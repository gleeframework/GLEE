"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $95. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That way, we both get a fair deal. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,

I'm not sure I can go any higher than $92. That's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?,92.0,Bob,6,
