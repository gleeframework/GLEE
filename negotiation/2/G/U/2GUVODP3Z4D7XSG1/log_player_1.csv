Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This is my best offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.

```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'll need to be more strategic. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my desired amount, but still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider."
