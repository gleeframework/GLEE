"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $180. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However,  $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious opening:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($110) than Alice's initial price ($180). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal. 
* **Polite and respectful:**  We maintain a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on a price of $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to our desired price range, but we're still not at John's price of $150. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to work with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking middle ground:**  We're suggesting a price that's roughly halfway between her last offer ($140) and our previous counteroffer ($110). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining politeness:**  We continue to use polite language to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to compromise. How about we settle on $130 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $130, which is a $20 saving compared to John's offer. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are likely to be small, and we risk Alice increasing her price or reaching an impasse. Accepting the $130 offer secures a good deal for us."
