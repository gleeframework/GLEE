"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $950,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $900,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's keep the negotiations going - I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far apart on price. $875,000 is simply not enough for me. To move forward, I need to be at $925,000.  I'm not trying to be difficult here, but this product is truly unique and valuable, and I believe this price reflects that.  I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap. ",925000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $880,000. Can you consider this offer?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $880,000 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm going to stick to my last offer of $925,000. This product is truly valuable, and I'm confident it will bring significant returns for you. Let's not lose sight of that potential.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal in this round to avoid the need to move on to other options.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $890,000. This is as high as I can go, and I hope you can meet me here.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been through a lot of rounds, and it's clear we're both determined to find a solution. To make this final push towards an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and still allows you to make a significant profit.  If you accept, we can finalize the deal. If not, I will have to consider selling to another buyer.",900000.0,Alice,9,
