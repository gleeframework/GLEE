"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal!",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a great price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",155.0,Alice,5,
