"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($8,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9000?  I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is better than John's price:**  $9,000 is still better than the $10,000 Bob would pay John.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  Bob has already countered once, and Alice rejected it. Further negotiation might push the price closer to John's offer, which Bob wants to avoid.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Alice's suggestion to split the difference is a reasonable compromise. 

It's a good move to accept Alice's offer and save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
