Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $650,000 is too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $800,000 for this product.  That's my absolute bottom line - how about it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

It seems we've reached the limit of Alice's flexibility. She's matched John's price, so there's no further benefit to negotiating.  We should accept the offer."
