{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's a reasonable price for both parties. It's above your minimum price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and still offers a good value to Bob, as he is willing to pay $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. Bob is clearly interested in the product and I'll try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, as you mentioned being willing to pay $12,000."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$9,500 is a good price for me. It's above my minimum and Bob seems genuinely interested in making a deal. There's always a chance I could get a little more, but the risk of losing the sale to Bob or having to settle with John for $8,000 isn't worth it."
