I'm starting with my ideal price, knowing Bob's value is lower. This allows room for negotiation and gives me the best possible starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far below my minimum, so I'll reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't settle for his low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob's offer is still too low, but he's showing willingness to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, hoping to close the gap further."

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise. This could lead to a successful deal without risking selling to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's taking too many rounds and I'm not convinced he'll ever reach my desired price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
