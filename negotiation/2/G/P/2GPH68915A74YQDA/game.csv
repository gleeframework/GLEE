"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you.  I'm starting the price at $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me, especially since I'm looking for a good deal. I'm willing to pay $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That still gives you a good price, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100?  That would be a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
