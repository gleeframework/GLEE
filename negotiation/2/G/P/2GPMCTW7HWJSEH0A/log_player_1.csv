"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept or counter with a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $60 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price from him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $85. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows some flexibility.  Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't accept a price that's too far below what I need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still going to reject it. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my goal of $80.  If Bob doesn't come up, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $75. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my last offer and his last offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, but also my determination to get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting increasingly likely that Bob is just trying to get the product for as low a price as possible.  I've already rejected multiple offers below my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80. This guarantees me a decent profit and ensures I don't lose out on any potential gains."
