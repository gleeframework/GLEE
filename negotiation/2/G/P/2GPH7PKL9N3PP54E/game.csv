"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to see if we can find common ground.  This offer is still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere, but I want to see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $850,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000.  This is the lowest I can go given the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
