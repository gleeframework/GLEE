"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($1,200,000). I have more rounds to negotiate and can still potentially get a better deal with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to see if we can find common ground.  This offer is still significantly less than what I could get elsewhere, but I want to see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  $850,000 is closer, but still a touch high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is tempting, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. With 6 rounds left, I still have room to negotiate a better price with Bob or fall back on the guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is still too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000.  This is the lowest I can go given the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
