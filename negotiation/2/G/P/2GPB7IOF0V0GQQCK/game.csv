"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $110. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I really like this product and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal. I'll go as low as $105, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you.",105.0,Bob,6,
