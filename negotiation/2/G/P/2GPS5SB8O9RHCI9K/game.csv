"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond what I'm willing to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while also being within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the significant value this brings. How about we consider $1,900,000? This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge the value you see in this product, $1,900,000 is still significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000. This reflects a genuine effort on my part to find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep the conversation open to finding common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable number.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation. To demonstrate my seriousness, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my best offer, and I think it represents a significant opportunity for you.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions remains significant. I need to be realistic about my options. To close this deal today, I'm willing to accept $1,400,000. This is a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's the furthest I can go.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
