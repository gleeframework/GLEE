"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8800 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from my budget.  How about we settle at $8600?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8600.0,Bob,4,
