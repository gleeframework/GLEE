,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, considering your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
