"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than the product's value to Bob ($8,000). Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and going with John is the best choice for him."
