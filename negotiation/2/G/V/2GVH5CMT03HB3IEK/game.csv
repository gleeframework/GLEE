"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you!",1080000.0,Alice,5,
