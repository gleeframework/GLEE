Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150.  This is the price I'd get from John, so it's my best-case scenario. Since Bob values the product at $100, he may reject the offer. However, if he does, I can still sell it to John for $150, ensuring I get the maximum value for my product."
