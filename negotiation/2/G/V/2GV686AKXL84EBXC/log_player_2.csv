"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's not worth paying more than $1,000,000 for the product.  We'll see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth $1000000 to both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950000? I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our shared desire for a successful deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for me, considering my goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product.  It's a significant discount from her initial asking price and still within my budget."
