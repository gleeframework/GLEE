"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
