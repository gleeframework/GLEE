# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$950,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject the offer and see what counteroffer Alice gives."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. $825,000 is a good price for me, saving me a considerable amount compared to John's offer.  I'll accept."
