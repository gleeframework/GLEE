"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept the offer. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $120. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower price ($90) to show Bob I'm flexible, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This offer gives Bob a chance to accept, and if he rejects, I'm prepared to move on to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm not willing to sell below $120, and I'll keep trying to negotiate with Bob. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
``` 

I'm offering $85, which is a significant step up from Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob, while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $80, but that's really stretching my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to give up the potential for a better deal.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob before I need to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $82.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I want to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 82.5} 
``` 

I'm offering $82.50, which is right in the middle between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's latest offer.  I'm trying to find a price that will be agreeable to both of us, and I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
