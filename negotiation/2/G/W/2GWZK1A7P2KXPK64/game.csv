"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $75. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's a bit above my budget. Can you consider my offer?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a good deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price. Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $78. I'm willing to pay that much for the product, but I think it's getting close to my maximum. Can you consider my offer?",78.0,Bob,4,
