I'm offering the product to Bob for $200. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $150. By starting high, I maximize my potential earnings while keeping the option to sell to John as a backup."
