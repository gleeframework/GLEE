Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  There's a potential profit margin between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a reasonable deal.  Going too close to $1,500,000 might scare him off, while going too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message positions the product as desirable and exclusive.
* **Justification:**  You haven't explicitly stated why you've chosen this price, allowing Bob to feel like he might be getting a slight discount without knowing your true bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning other potential buyers creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a quicker decision.

**Important Note:** This is just one offer strategy.  You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
