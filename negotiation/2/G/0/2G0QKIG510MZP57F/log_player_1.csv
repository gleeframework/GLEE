I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer. I believe this is a good starting point to see where Bob stands and to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm hoping that this will be a reasonable price for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1 million, $925,000 is a good price. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price and it's more than Bob's previous offer.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $1,200,000."
