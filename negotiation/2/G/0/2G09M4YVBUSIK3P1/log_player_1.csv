"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm reducing my price a bit, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's offer, and I'm getting closer to my initial desired price.  It's worth taking the deal now and avoiding the risk of further negotiation."
