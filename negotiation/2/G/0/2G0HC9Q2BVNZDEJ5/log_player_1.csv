Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,500,000 is too low for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its value."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still working within a specific budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $1,600,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or Bob walking away."
