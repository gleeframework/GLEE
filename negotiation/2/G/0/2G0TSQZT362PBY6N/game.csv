"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $10,500?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $9,750 just isn't going to cut it for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
