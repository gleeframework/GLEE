"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1000000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value. You can potentially save more by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
