# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledge your perspective on the price.  However,  $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer considering the value this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $875,000 for the product.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down slightly to $885,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's value.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $885,000, which is very close to my target price of $850,000.  This is a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small changes.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product without risking a last-minute price increase from Alice or losing the opportunity to John."
