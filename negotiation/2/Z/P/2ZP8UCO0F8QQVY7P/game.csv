"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledge your perspective on the price.  However,  $850,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer considering the value this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $875,000 for the product.  This would give us both a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
