"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $17,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on $14,000.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another seller.",14000.0,Bob,4,
