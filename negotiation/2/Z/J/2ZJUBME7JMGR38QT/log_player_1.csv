Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $100. I believe it would be highly valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and leaves me space to potentially negotiate down slightly if he hesitates. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, asking for a price too close to Bob's maximum ($120) might make him feel like I'm trying to take advantage, potentially leading to rejection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between profit maximization and the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
