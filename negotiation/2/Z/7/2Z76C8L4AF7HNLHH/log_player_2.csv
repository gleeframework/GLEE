"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you, Bob! I'm willing to let you have this amazing product for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $90.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you will pay $100 to John, which is still within your budget and the maximum you are willing to pay."
