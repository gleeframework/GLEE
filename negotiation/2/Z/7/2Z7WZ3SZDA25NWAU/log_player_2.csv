"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely do better. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $1,000,000 as a safety net. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** Bob highlights the importance of a deal that benefits both parties.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates flexibility and willingness to continue discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer of $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, Bob is still within his target price range and has time to negotiate further. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price even lower, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Bob can still buy the product from John for $1,000,000 if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $825,000? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Counteroffer:** Bob is making a smaller counteroffer than before, showing a willingness to negotiate but also pushing for a lower price. 
* **Maintaining a Fair Deal:**  He emphasizes that the offer is ""fair"" and reflects the product's value, trying to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  The offer is still within Bob's target price range of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $5000 to sweeten the deal. This package includes additional features and services that will enhance the product's value to you. With the bonus package, the total price would be $830000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer of $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $830,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $830,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $830,000 is a good price for Bob, especially with the added bonus package. He's saving a significant amount compared to John's price.
* **Negotiations Stalled:** Alice has already matched Bob's counteroffer. Continuing to negotiate might not result in a significantly lower price, and Bob might lose the deal entirely.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only five rounds remaining, it's wise to secure the deal rather than risk losing it."
