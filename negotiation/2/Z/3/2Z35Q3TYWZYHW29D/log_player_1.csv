Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  Offering it at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice if Bob accepts.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" appealing to Bob's potential gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""we can discuss further"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving room to close the deal above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
