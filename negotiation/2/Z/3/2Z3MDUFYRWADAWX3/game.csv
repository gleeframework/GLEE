"I appreciate your willingness to sell the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me is no more than $1500000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $800000, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is no more than $1500000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is at least $800000.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
