Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $13,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it for slightly less still yields a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $13,000 is a strong starting point. It's considerably more than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Exclusivity Appeal:**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" and a ""special price,"" we create a sense of urgency and value, potentially persuading Bob to accept. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price outweighs the guaranteed $15,000 from John in this scenario."
