{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that is likely acceptable to Alice, as it's still higher than her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, it's still higher than what you'd ideally like to pay.  Rejecting again allows you to continue trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's still a good chance you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing your previous offer but staying below Alice's latest offer. It shows you're serious about negotiating a fair price while demonstrating your willingness to meet halfway.  This could be a good strategy to get Alice to accept a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now getting too close to John's price.  It's unlikely she'll budge much further, and you're likely to end up paying a price very close to what John is offering.  It's more efficient to buy from John at this point, avoiding further rounds of negotiation.  While you save a little by negotiating with Alice, the time and effort involved likely don't outweigh the small price difference."
