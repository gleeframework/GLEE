"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from John ($1,000,000). It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  It is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to Alice is $800,000 and your maximum price is $1,000,000. This allows for some potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $900,000 is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000. While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and losing the opportunity to buy from her at this price is too high. It's a good deal, and it's better than buying from John."
