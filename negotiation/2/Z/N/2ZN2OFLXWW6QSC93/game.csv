"Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really only able to pay $95. Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $115 is still above my budget.  Let's try $105.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Bob,6,
