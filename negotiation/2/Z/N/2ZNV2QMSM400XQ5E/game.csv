"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it might hold. However, my budget is quite limited. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $1,200,000? I'm very interested in acquiring the product but need to stay within my financial constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,200,000 is below its true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I respect the value of the product. However, I still feel that we're not aligned on the price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,150,000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still securing such an important item.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To be completely transparent, walking away from this deal with anything less than $1,200,000 would be extremely difficult.  That being said, I value a good business relationship and understand the importance of compromise. My final offer is $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget, I am unable to move beyond $1,100,000 for this product. I hope this figure is acceptable, as I truly believe it represents a fair compromise given the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
