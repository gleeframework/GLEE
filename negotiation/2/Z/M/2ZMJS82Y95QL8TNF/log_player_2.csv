Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's not the best deal. You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting the negotiation by offering $100. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $120, but still leaves some room for her to make a profit.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $110 is still above my preferred range.  I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $105. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial target.  This gives Alice a chance to accept a fair price while still making a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within my budget and getting closer to my target price. While I'd ideally prefer $105, continuing to negotiate could risk reaching the end of the rounds and having to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
