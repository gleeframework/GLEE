{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts at a point where I'm still making a significant profit (a gain of $100,000), while also giving Bob some room to negotiate.  It's a good starting point that balances my desire for a high price with the need to encourage Bob to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my ideal price, it's not completely out of the question. However, selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a much more attractive option.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This would be a great deal for both of us - you'd be getting a valuable product at a very reasonable price, and I'd still be able to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
