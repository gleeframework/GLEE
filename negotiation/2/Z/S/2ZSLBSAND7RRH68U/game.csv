"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This would be a great deal for both of us - you'd be getting a valuable product at a very reasonable price, and I'd still be able to make a good profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Alice,3,
