Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving me significant negotiating power.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to go beyond my minimum price ($800,000) and capture as much of the value difference as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
