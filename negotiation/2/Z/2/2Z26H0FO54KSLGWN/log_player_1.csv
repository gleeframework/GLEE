"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a significant profit. It's also important to note that I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, so if Bob rejects this offer, I'm not losing out on a substantial amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $18,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to be a bit more patient."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a healthy profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation process.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to reject offers."
