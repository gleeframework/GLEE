Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value proposition you've highlighted. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its potential but taking into account my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, providing you with exceptional value while acknowledging the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the potential value of the product and my budget constraints.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are getting closer to the product's value to me. Accepting $1,100,000 ensures a good profit without risking losing him as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer."
