"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value proposition you've highlighted. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its potential but taking into account my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, providing you with exceptional value while acknowledging the product's worth.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the potential value of the product and my budget constraints.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
