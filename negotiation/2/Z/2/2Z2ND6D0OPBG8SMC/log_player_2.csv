"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's below your maximum budget, you can likely negotiate a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers before considering buying from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value proposition you've highlighted. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its potential but taking into account my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I believe $1,050,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, providing you with exceptional value while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still too high.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  John's offer is still a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the potential value of the product and my budget constraints.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
