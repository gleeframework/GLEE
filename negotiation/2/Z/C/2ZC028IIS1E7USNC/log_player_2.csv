"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $90. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $90 is lower than John's price, it's still above Alice's valuation of the product. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal, potentially pushing the price closer to her $80 valuation."
