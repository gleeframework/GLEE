Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $15,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to try to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, but it still allows me to get more than Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that will allow us to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's still significantly higher than my minimum and better than selling to John for $15,000. It's time to close this deal."
