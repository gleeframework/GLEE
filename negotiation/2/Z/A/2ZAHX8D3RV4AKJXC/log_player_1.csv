Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility, suggesting I'm open to discussing the price. 

This approach balances my desire for a high price with the need to be persuasive and avoid immediately rejecting Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **John as a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $120 provides security if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value, aiming to find a mutually acceptable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **High-Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value proposition to Bob, reminding him that $95 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to foster a sense of cooperation.

This approach aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us and avoid a complete breakdown in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $87.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still significantly lower than I'd like.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions, potentially bringing the price down to a point where it's no longer profitable for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired $120, eliminating the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation.

While I'd prefer a higher price, the security of selling to John at my minimum acceptable price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob."
