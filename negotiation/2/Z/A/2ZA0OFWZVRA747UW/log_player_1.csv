"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation but aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $9,500 is still well above my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential concessions during the negotiation.
* **Assessing Bob's reaction:** Observing Bob's response will give me insights into his negotiation style and how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming higher:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting his offer gives me a chance to see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Potential for win-win:**  By rejecting and counteroffering, there's a possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial price.
* **Not settling too soon:**  Selling to John is still an option, but I'm not in a rush to accept a mediocre offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:**  This price still leaves a good profit margin for me.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about the deal. If he accepts, it's a win for both of us. If he rejects, I can make a final decision on whether to accept his offer or move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, leaving fewer opportunities to negotiate.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to reject offers risks that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though the price is close to my minimum, accepting this offer ensures a sale and could potentially open the door for future negotiations with Bob."
