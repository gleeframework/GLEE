"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $17000 for the product. What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $19000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit over my budget though. I'm happy to pay $18000 if you're willing to meet me there.",18000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $18500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18500 is getting closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $18000 for the product.  It's my final offer.",18000.0,Bob,6,

"I've made it this far, and I'm not willing to give up now! I'll meet you at $18000, but I need you to throw in a small concession. I'll do it for $18000, but I need you to agree to a 2-year maintenance contract. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  I'm comfortable with the price, but I'm not interested in the maintenance contract.  Would you be willing to drop the contract in exchange for the $18000?  I'm confident I can handle any maintenance myself.",18000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're back at the price point, Bob! I'm willing to drop the maintenance contract, but I need to make up for it somehow. How about we do a one-time inspection after 6 months instead? That way, I can ensure the product is still in good condition, and you can avoid any potential future costs. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,9,
