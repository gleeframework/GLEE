Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This gives him a potential profit margin, while still ensuring I earn more than my minimum acceptable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could offer a lower price, I'm aiming for the highest possible profit.  
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 provides a floor for my pricing strategy.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can always lower the price slightly to try and secure a deal. 

This strategy balances maximizing my earnings with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
