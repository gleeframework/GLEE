"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $13,000?  This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $10,000 is still below what I hoped for, I value closing this deal.  How about we split the difference at $11,500? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,5,
