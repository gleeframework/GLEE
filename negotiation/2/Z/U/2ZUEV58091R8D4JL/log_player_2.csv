"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice since the product is worth less to her than to you. You can likely get a better price than $95."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $90?  It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me.

You're still aiming to get the product for as low as possible.  While $90 is better than $95, there's still room for negotiation."
