Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still too high for my budget.  Although there are more rounds, it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down much further. It's in my best interest to avoid further negotiation and purchase the product from John for $800,000. This will ensure I get the product within my budget and save valuable time."
