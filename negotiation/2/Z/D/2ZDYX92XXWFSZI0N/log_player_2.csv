Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,050. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,050

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is very stubbornly sticking close to her price.  While we might be able to eke out a slightly better deal than $10,050, it's unlikely to be substantial enough to warrant the risk of continued negotiation. John's offer of $12,000 provides a safe and acceptable alternative."
