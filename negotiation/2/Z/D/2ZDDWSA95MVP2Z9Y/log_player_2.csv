"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. We are confident in its value and believe it could be worth $950,000 to you. Would you consider this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. It's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. You can likely get a better deal than buying from John."
