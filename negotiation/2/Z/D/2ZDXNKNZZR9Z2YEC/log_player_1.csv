# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $850000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I'm willing to purchase it immediately. Let me know what you think.
