"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product at a price that's significantly lower than its true market value. While I'm confident it's worth at least $1.5 million, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial savings for you and a great opportunity to own a valuable asset. Consider this offer carefully, as I'm confident it won't be available for long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
