"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, though. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down a bit more, though.  Let's try $850,000. This would give you a great deal on a product that you value at $800,000.  It's a win-win for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
