Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $80, giving me a good profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $80, so I have no risk in offering a higher price.  I'm hoping Bob values the product more than $100 and will accept the offer."
