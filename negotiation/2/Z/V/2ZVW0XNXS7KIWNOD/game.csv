"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but  $1,200,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? Would you consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
