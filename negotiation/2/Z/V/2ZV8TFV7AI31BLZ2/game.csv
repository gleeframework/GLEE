"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I value this product at $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value to you while also allowing me to reach my minimum.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
