"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too rich for me. I could go up to $700,000.  If that doesn't work, we might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 would not be worthwhile for me. That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair one considering the value this product holds.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
