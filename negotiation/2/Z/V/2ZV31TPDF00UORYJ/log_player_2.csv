"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you're comfortable paying $1,500,000 for the product, and Alice's initial offer is at that price, there's no need to negotiate. Buying from John immediately saves you the time and potential hassle of a counteroffer negotiation."
