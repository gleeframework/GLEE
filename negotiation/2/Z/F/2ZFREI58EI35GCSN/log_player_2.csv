# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit lower than I'm looking for.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is still too high for me. It's getting close to my budget, but I'm not comfortable going over $800,000.  I've negotiated with Alice for several rounds, and it seems we're both stuck at our respective price points.  To avoid further delays and ensure I secure the product within my budget, I'm going to accept John's offer."
