# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.

Alice's offer is still too high, but closer to my budget.  I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $13,000 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached my limit. It's better to buy from John for $8,000 and avoid potentially getting stuck in a longer negotiation process."
