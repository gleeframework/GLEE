"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is my best offer, as I'm also considering other options.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $11,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
