"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value you would place on the product, given its worth to you is $15,000. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob can save at least $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating further.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob is still paying more than the product's worth to Alice. There's potential to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to pay more than that. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $10,000 for the product. My next offer for the product is $11,000. I hope this price better aligns with our negotiation goals. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob.  He's getting the product for $4,000 less than what John is offering, and it's closer to Alice's perceived value. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting again and Bob ending up buying from John at $15,000 outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
