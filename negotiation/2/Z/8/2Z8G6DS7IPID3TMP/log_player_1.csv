"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point that is significantly higher than your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that you are confident in the value of your product.  By setting a high initial price, you have room to make concessions if necessary, while still aiming for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet. I still have the opportunity to negotiate a better price with him in the following rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000. This counteroffer allows for further discussion and hopefully leads us closer to a mutually acceptable price."

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $1,120,000. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to meet halfway.  I believe this price is still fair, given the product's value to Bob, and it should encourage him to accept the offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,040,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,040,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. Bob's offer is now below my minimum price.  While I could continue negotiating, it is risky and the chance of securing a better price is slim.  Selling to John for $800,000 ensures a guaranteed sale and fulfills my minimum price requirement."
