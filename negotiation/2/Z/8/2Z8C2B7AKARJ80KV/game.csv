"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be open to considering $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $675,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to make a move that shows I'm serious about buying. How about we settle on $660,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",660000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $675,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $670,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",670000.0,Alice,7,
