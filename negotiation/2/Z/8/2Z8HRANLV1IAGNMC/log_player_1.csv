"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth even more in your hands. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to give up yet. There are still 8 rounds to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. Selling to John would guarantee a higher price, but it's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price point with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my current budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This seems to be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I am still not satisfied with the price. There are still six rounds left, and I believe that I can potentially push for a higher price. Selling to John would guarantee $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1,310,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with my budget while still recognizing the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,310,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,310,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only four rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that satisfies my minimum requirement of $1,500,000.  While Bob's offer of $1,310,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially lower offers, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing my desired profit."
