"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth even more in your hands. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,200,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Considering my current budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This seems to be a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1,310,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with my budget while still recognizing the value of the product.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
