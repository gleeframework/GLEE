Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $22,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 19000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $19,000 is still too high for my budget. I could consider a price closer to $13,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is increasing his offer in very small increments, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $15,000 within the remaining rounds.  It's more profitable to cut the negotiation short and secure the $15,000 from John."
