"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be able to move forward with the sale.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can also buy from John for $12,000, which is a better deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  This is the best option as it is his maximum budget and he has reached a point where he can't negotiate a lower price with Alice."
