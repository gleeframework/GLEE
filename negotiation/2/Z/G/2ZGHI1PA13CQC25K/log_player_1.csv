Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the value of the product for me. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see a figure closer to $950,000 to make this work. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product for your business. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and it's a much better deal than selling to John. It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate, so it's possible we could have reached a better agreement if we had more rounds."
