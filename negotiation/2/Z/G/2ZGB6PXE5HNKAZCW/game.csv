"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $975,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. I'll offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  I can go up to $910,000, but that's really the limit for me.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $920,000. This is the final compromise I'm willing to make.",920000.0,Alice,7,
