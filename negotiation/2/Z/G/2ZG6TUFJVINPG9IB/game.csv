"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $18000 is still below my minimum acceptable price for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering it to you for $19000.  This is a great price for a product of this quality.  Let me know if you're interested!",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $19000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $17500 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm only able to go to $18500.  This is a very fair price for the value you'll get from this product. Let's try to close the deal. ",18500.0,Alice,5,
