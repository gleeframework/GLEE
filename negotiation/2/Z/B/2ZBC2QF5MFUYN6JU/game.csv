"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer, but $95 is still below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
