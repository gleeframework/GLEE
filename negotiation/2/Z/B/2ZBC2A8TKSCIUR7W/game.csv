"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate.  $8,500 is a bit lower than what I can accept at this time.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That way, you get a good deal, and I can still make a fair profit.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I value a fair compromise, $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for something closer to our previous proposal.  How about $8,900?  That's a small step closer to your budget, and it ensures I can still make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both.",8900.0,Alice,5,
