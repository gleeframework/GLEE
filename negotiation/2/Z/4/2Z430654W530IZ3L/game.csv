"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
