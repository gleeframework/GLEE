Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but not outrageously high.  I want to see if Bob is interested in this price point. If he's not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm counteroffering with $140.  This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my original asking price, $130 is a good deal and still better than selling to John.  It seems like Bob is firm on his price, so further negotiation is unlikely to be successful."
