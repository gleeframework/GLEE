"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500? This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for the value you'll be getting.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Is $8,500 a price you'd be willing to accept?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to accepting, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. Is $8,800 a price you'd be willing to accept?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This is a very fair price for the value of the product.  I hope you'll consider it. We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, so I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",9200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $9,200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,8,
