Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $9,200 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. If you're willing to accept that, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.
