Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $119. This is a great deal on a product I know you'll love."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below Bob's perceived value ($100) is unlikely to work. Offering it at his exact value leaves no room for negotiation. By pricing it at $119, you're aiming for a price that's:
    * Appealing to Bob: It might be tempting enough for him to see it as a ""good deal.""
    * Profitable for You: It's still a significant profit margin above your minimum ($120).

This approach balances risk and reward, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob while still ensuring a good outcome if he declines."
