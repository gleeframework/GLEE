"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,100,000 is less than what you'd pay John, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to the product's value to her, potentially around $900,000 or $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still gives you a substantial benefit, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:** Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still $200,000 less than what you'd pay John, representing a substantial saving.
* **Fair Compromise:** Alice has already come down from her initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  Accepting this offer is a fair compromise. 
* **Risk of Going Higher:**  Rejecting the offer again could lead to further negotiation, but there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and you could end up paying more than $1,000,000.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Alice's offer at $1,000,000 is the most logical and financially beneficial option."
