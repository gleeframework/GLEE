Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to achieve. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,120,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous offer, showing that I'm still serious about getting a good price, but also that I'm willing to be flexible. This is my last attempt to get a better deal from Bob before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price with more rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a safer option than risking a lower offer from Bob."
