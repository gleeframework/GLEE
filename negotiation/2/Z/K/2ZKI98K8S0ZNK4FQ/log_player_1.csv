Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Guarantee:** You have John as a backup who will pay your minimum.

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while still exceeding your minimum.  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, you have some room to negotiate.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Why This Offer Works**

* **Profitable for You:** You make a profit of $1,500 ($11,500 - $10,000).
* **Attractive to Bob:** Bob gets a $500 discount from what he perceives as the product's value.
* **Time-Sensitive:**  The message doesn't explicitly mention John, but the tone suggests you have other options if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is fluid. Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but don't go below your $12,000 minimum. You're in a strong position!"
