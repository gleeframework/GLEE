Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
