Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm excited about its potential. However, my budget is limited to $1,000,000, and I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?

Round 4

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is willing to negotiate. We're getting close to John's offer, but I believe we can still push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is the highest I can go. Would you consider this offer?

**Reasoning:** Bob has not budged from his previous offer, indicating this is likely his ceiling. Accepting $825,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially falling below John's offer."
