{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a strategic starting point. It's high enough to give me a decent profit, but low enough to be appealing to Bob considering his value of $150.  We'll see if he bites, and then we can adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is more than my minimum, it's still a bit lower than my ideal profit. I'm going to try to push for a higher price by sending a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
