"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Is this a price you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate you showing me the product.  However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. I can do $140, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I think this product is worth more than that to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still not sure I can go that high. How about $125?  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and allows us to close the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $135, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This would give you a decent profit and allow me to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'd like to add a slight premium for the value this product brings to you. I can do $132, which is still a fair price for both of us.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to make a profit, but I'm still hesitant at $132. I'm willing to go up to $131. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without any further back and forth.",131.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $131, but I'd like to add a small buffer for any potential issues or changes in the future. I can do $132.50, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",132.5,Alice,9,
