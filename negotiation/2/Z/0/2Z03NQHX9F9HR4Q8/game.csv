"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to my value for the product and still allows you to make a profit.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
