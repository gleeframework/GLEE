"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this.  Let's meet in the middle. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit away from $10,500. How about we meet at $9,900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget",9900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,900 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,200, which is closer to your offer and still gives me a reasonable return.  Let's make this happen!",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,200, but I'm still a bit away from that. How about we meet at $9,800 again? I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm really trying to stay within my budget",9800.0,Bob,6,
