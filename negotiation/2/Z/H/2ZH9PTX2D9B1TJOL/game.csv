"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you.  I propose a starting price of $2,300,000. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. This is a significant discount from your original offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 significantly undervalues the unique aspects of this product. Let's meet in the middle – how about $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. What do you think?",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial.  $2,000,000 is my final offer – it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $2,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000. What do you think?",1950000.0,Bob,6,
