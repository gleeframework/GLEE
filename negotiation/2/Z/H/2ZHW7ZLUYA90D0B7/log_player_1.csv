Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $80, but also leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering $100, I'm setting the stage for a potential negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, or I might be willing to come down a bit.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** This price ensures that I'm earning more than my minimum of $120. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired amount.
* **Sell to John as a Backstop:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me a safety net during negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $90. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm offering a price of $90, which is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. I'm justifying this counteroffer with a message that highlights the value of the product. 
* **Finding a Compromise:** My goal is to find a middle ground where both Bob and I can agree. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring that I'm making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, his offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **No Significant Upside:**  There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob could lead to a lower price, or even a stalemate. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John for $120 ensures that I meet my minimum price and secure a guaranteed profit."
