"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $102. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested!",102.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $102, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I think that's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",102.0,Alice,7,
