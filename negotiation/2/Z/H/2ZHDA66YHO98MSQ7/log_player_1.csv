Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find something similar elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider accepting $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below your ideal price.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $92 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's slightly lower than your last counteroffer, it's still closer to your desired price than selling to John. You've already been through multiple rounds of negotiation, and it's likely Bob is firm on his price. Accepting this offer ensures you secure a good profit."
