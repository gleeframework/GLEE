"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the item, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $100? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to say that $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still be getting a fantastic deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
