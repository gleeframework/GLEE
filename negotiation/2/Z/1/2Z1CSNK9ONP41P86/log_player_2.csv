"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend around $10000, but I have to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to Bob's desired price of $10,000 and still below the $15,000 he'd pay from John. Accepting the offer saves Bob $4,000 compared to buying from John."
