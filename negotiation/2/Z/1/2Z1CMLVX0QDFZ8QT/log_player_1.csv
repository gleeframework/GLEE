"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get a price closer to my minimum of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but not too much.  $9,500 is still above Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate while also protecting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered $9,000 which is closer to my minimum price and a better offer than John's $10,000. This is a good opportunity to close the deal with Bob."
