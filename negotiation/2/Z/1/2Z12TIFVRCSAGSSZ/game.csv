"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,750? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's worth, and it gives me a little more than my minimum. What do you say?",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $8,250. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
