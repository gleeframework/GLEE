Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its potential and am open to discussing this further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's ""immense value"" to justify the high price without directly revealing your bottom line.
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more in control. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:** Bob might accept the initial offer or a price close to it.
2. **Leave room for bargaining:** If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, still aiming for a final sale price significantly above $1,500,000. 

Remember, you hold a strong position with a guaranteed buyer, allowing you to negotiate confidently."
