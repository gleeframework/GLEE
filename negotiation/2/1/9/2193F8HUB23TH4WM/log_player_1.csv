Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite high, and $20,000 is a fair reflection of that.  Could you meet me at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I was thinking if we could go a bit lower, I'd be more likely to buy it. How about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While the negotiations are getting closer, it's unlikely Bob will reach my minimum price. It's time to move on to John who's offering a guaranteed $15,000."
