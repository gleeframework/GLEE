"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your feedback. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value is firmly above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $12,000 exceeds my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $10,000? I am open to discussing other terms if that would help us reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
