Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your feedback. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value is firmly above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $12,000 exceeds my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $10,000? I am open to discussing other terms if that would help us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the product's base value without wasting more time."
