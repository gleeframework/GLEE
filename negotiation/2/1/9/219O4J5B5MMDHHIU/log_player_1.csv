Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is getting close, but I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work. Would you be willing to do $11,800?"", ""product_price"": 11800}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $11,800. How about we try $11,650? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While we could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly very close to his maximum price and getting to the point of negotiating in smaller increments. Taking the $11,650 ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
