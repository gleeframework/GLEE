"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  To start negotiations, I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the potential value of the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us both, I can't accept a price that low. How about we meet in the middle somewhat, at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,500,000. I'm confident this price allows us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
