**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, he's moving slowly. At this point, the difference between his offer ($1,450,000) and John's standing offer ($1,500,000) is relatively small. It's not worth the risk of Bob's negotiations stalling out and potentially getting a lower final offer. Taking John's offer guarantees the $1,500,000 and avoids further negotiation time and effort."
