Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher to maximize potential profit. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product, I'm attempting to anchor Bob's perception of the price at a higher point.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is not a demand, but an invitation for discussion (""What do you think?""). This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum."
