"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,000. I think it's worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise again, though. How about we meet at $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,5,
