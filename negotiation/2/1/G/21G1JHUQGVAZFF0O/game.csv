"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for me, though.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we split the difference and do $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant drop from my original price.  Let's find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
