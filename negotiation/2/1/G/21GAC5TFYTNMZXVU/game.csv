"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. It's truly valuable and I believe it can significantly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $975,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $725,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's value significantly exceeds $725,000, making it difficult for me to accept your offer.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $900,000? This is a firm offer, reflecting a significant compromise on my end.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I know we're both trying to find a solution that works. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in line with my initial offer. How about $775,000? This shows I'm willing to move, but it needs to make sense for my budget.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. However, we need to bridge a significant gap in our valuations.  To be entirely transparent, this product holds substantial value for me, and I have another potential buyer at a higher price point.  Therefore, my final offer is $850,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth.",850000.0,Alice,7,
