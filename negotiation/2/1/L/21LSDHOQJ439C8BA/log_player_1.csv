"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price, considering your minimum value and Bob's perceived value. It also leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal."", ""product_price"": 92.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $87.50 is still too low.  I'll continue negotiating and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still below my minimum. Let's meet halfway again, and I'll accept $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
