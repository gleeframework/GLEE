"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. Let's meet in the middle - how about $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still out of my price range. I'm firm on my $80 offer. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look elsewhere.",80.0,Bob,4,
