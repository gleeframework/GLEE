"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  $14,000 is still above the value Alice places on the product, indicating there's room for negotiation."

Bob should reject the offer. While it's lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price. There's still room for negotiation, and it's likely Bob can get a better deal by making another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see that you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, the price is very close to his maximum value and it's likely Alice won't budge further.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling through and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
