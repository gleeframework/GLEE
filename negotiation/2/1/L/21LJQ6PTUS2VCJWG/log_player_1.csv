"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that's positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, as this is a common negotiation tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push for a higher price with further rounds.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:**  Selling to John for $150 would be acceptable, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next round:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still allows me to make a decent profit and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin.  
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Seek compromise:** I'm suggesting we try to find a compromise to show willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $115 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **More negotiation room:** There's still potential to push for a higher price with further rounds. 
* **John's offer is a backup:**  While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, John's offer of $150 is a safe fallback option.

**Next round:** I will counter with a price closer to $130, aiming to meet halfway between our last offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing $122.50 as a compromise.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 122.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($130) and Bob's latest offer ($115). 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price that considers both our perspectives.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
