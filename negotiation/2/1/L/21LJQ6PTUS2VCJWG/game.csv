"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",170.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still allows me to make a decent profit and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $115 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $115 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing $122.50 as a compromise.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal.",122.5,Alice,5,
