"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1250000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $1350000 to make this worthwhile. This is my final counteroffer. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
