Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still willing to try and get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $1,200,000 and closer to my initial asking price. I'm happy to accept this offer."
