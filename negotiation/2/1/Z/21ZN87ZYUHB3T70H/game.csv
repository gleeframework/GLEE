"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,450,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,625,000. This is a price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
