"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1800000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1400000, but I can't go any higher.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. After re-evaluating the value of the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1520000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth. If you're still interested, let me know.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
