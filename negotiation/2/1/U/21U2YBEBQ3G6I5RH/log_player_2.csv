Alice's offer:

# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll meet you at $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
