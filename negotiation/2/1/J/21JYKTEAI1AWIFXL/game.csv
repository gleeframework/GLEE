"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10800. It's still a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If you're willing to sell it to me at that price, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000",10000.0,Bob,6,
