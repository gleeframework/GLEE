Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has shown she's unlikely to go much lower than $15,000.  Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it's more financially beneficial to buy from him, even if it means missing out on further negotiation with Alice."
