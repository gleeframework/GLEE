# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $80 to you. Considering its worth and the benefits it provides, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You're willing to pay $80, but since John is also selling the product for $80, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  You can save yourself the hassle of negotiating with Alice and go directly to John."
