Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob values the product at $8,000, I don't know his upper limit. Starting with a price closer to my minimum ($15,000) gives me room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special deal"" or implying he's getting an advantage might make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $12,000 offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price that's still profitable for me, even if it's not the full $15,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still rely on John's guaranteed purchase at my minimum acceptable price."
