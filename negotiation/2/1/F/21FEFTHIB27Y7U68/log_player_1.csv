{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer gives me a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation and potential for a higher price. It also demonstrates that I'm willing to be flexible and find a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not at a level that maximizes my profit. I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers you, and it's a price I feel confident in.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I'd like to continue negotiating, the risk of further downward pressure on the price is too high. I'm better off accepting John's offer of $800,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale and avoid further potential losses."
