"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  I've set the price at $1,300,000, reflecting its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000**.  
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can likely get a better price from Alice, even if it means going through a few counteroffers. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option** if negotiations with Alice fail, but it's not the best outcome since it's your highest price."

Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your target price.** While it's closer to your ideal range, there's still room for negotiation.
* **You're willing to walk away.** You have a fallback option with John, which means you're not pressured to accept a price that's not favorable to you.
* **Continuing to negotiate is likely to lead to a better price.**  By rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer, you can potentially reach a more favorable agreement."
