"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which I believe would greatly benefit and enhance your business operations. Given its immense value to you, I propose an offer to acquire it for $950,000. This price reflects the product's worth to both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction. Should you find this proposal acceptable, please let me know, and we can proceed with the details of the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, it's still a significant markup from her own valuation of $800,000. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation. You have a better alternative (buying from John for $1,000,000) if Alice doesn't come down to a more reasonable price."
