"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $130. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $132 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product!",132.0,Alice,5,
