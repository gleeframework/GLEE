"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $130. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.**  
* **You have room to negotiate.**  While Alice values the product at $120, she's willing to sell it for $130. This indicates potential for a lower price.
* **John is a backup option.**  Knowing you can get the product for $150 from John gives you leverage to negotiate a better price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $130 is a bit above my budget. I'm happy to purchase the product for $125.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? It's a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $150.**  
* **You have room to negotiate further.** Alice is willing to compromise, but her offer is still higher than your initial counteroffer. 
* **John is still a viable option.** You can always buy from John for $150 if you don't reach a better deal with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go down to $130. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $132 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.**  While she's offering a small discount, it's still not within your comfort zone.
* **John's price is only slightly higher.**  Considering that you're within $3 of John's price, and Alice seems unwilling to budge further, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. 
* **Time is a factor.**  The negotiation process is taking time, and it might be more efficient to buy from John and avoid further haggling."
