As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit on your end. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $750,000.
