# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. Given its potential for growth and impact, I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price allows for a significant profit for you while also providing me with a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is selling for $1,000,000, while John is selling for $1,200,000.  This saves you $200,000.
* **The offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
