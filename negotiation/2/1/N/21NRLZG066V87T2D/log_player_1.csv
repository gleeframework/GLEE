Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth $1,000,000 to me. Bob knows it's worth $800,000 to him, so there's room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. If not, I'll go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still a substantial amount. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility. $900,000 is still a significant amount for Bob, and it's a reasonable compromise considering his offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum value. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000,  I'm concerned about potentially losing more money by continuing to negotiate and risking Bob backing out completely.  I'll accept his offer and move forward with the sale."
