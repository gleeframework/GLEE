This exceptional item comes with a variety of features that cater to diverse needs. I believe its value exceeds $80, but I'm open to discussing the price. Let's aim for a fair deal that reflects the quality and utility it offers. What do you think about starting at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've put into this product. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
