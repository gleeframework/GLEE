Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700,000.

I hope you'll consider it.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I've been flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $800,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
