"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget, I'm looking to stay within $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit below my desired price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would give you a fair price, and it's a good starting point for a deal we can both agree on.",10500.0,Alice,3,
