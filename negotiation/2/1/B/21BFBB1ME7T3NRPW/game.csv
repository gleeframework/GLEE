"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,075,000?  This would still represent a significant value to you, and would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a respectable profit.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
