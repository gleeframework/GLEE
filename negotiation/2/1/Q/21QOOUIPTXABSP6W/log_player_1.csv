This offer sets a starting point that is above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It also positions the price as fair and acknowledges Bob's potential value for the product."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1050000 is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value, and it seems we are at an impasse.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with him, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  This will guarantee me my minimum value and avoid further negotiation."
