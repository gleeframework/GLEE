"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1175000? This price still allows for a good profit for you, while staying closer to my minimum value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1075000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1125000? This price is fair and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1125000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1075000, but I'd like to see if we can do better than that. How about $1075000 is the top of my budget?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
