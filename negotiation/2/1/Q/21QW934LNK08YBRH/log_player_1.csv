Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), I want to start with a significantly higher offer to explore the potential for a larger profit margin.
* **Open for negotiation:** The message is phrased to invite negotiation (""What do you think?"") rather than being a hard ultimatum. This allows Bob to counter-offer and keeps the conversation going.
* **Backup plan:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price. This allows me to be bolder in my negotiation with Bob."
