This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still potentially appealing to her. It leaves room for negotiation and signals your serious interest in buying the product."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is still slightly higher than your maximum.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before accepting her offer or going with John."

This counteroffer is a bit closer to Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals your willingness to compromise while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget,  buying from John at $8,000 is the most economical choice.  It's possible that Alice might eventually come down to your maximum price, but there's no guarantee, and continuing to negotiate could become time-consuming. Buying from John provides certainty and a good price."
