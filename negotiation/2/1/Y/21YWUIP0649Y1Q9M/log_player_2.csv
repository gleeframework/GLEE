"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. How does $125 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice's offer of $125 is better than John's offer of $150, but you can likely get a better deal.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a more competitive offer."
