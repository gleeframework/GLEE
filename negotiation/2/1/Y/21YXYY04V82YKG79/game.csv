"Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value and potential for growth. I understand its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I aim to provide you with an offer that respects both the product's value and your financial considerations. After careful deliberation, I propose to sell the product to you at a price of $950,000. This offer not only allows us to maintain a fair profit margin but also presents an opportunity for you to secure this valuable asset at a competitive rate. I look forward to discussing this further and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,
