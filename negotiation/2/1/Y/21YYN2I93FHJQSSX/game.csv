"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is closer to our previous offer and a good compromise.  Let's work together to find a solution.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not quite comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $875,000, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $885,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",885000.0,Alice,5,
