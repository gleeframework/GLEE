I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm still hopeful that I can get a little more for the product. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price that might be acceptable to both of us."

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $12,000. Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $12,000 and move on."
