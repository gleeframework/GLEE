"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go as high as $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
