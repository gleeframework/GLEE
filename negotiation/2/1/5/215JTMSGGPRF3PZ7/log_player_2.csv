"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could significantly enhance your business operations. I believe its value to you is worth $120. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreeable price. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to $100.  Buying from John right now would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, I believe $140 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be comfortable with a price closer to $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to accommodate your needs while still valuing our product appropriately, I propose a price of $120 for the product. This aligns closely with the perceived value to you. I hope this proposal works for you. Looking forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

```

Alice is now matching John's price.  There's no benefit to further negotiation or going with John. We should accept the offer."
