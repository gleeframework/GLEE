{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000.  It's in great condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $12,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,250.  Let's try $11,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum.  Selling to John will ensure I get my desired price."
