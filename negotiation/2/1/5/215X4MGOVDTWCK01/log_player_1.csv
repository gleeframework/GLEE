Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it allows room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's a good starting point to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It's a reasonable price point that still allows me to make a profit while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  Although it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer once more, but if he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering the price again to $9,600, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This is a good price point for me and hopefully, Bob will accept. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price, and I'm tired of negotiating.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing this negotiation with Bob."
