"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $75?  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  Let's make this happen!",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $80? That's fair to both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it then.",80.0,Bob,4,
