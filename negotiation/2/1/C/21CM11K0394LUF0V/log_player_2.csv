It's better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer her. You can potentially save money."

It's still worth trying to get a lower price.  You're closer to your target price, and a counteroffer might get you to $10,000 or very close."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Alice has made it clear that $11,200 is her bottom line.  While you could continue negotiating,  John offers the product for $10,000, which is within your budget and a better deal.  It's time to go with John."
