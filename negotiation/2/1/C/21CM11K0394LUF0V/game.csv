"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little too high at $11,000.  How about we split the difference at $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
