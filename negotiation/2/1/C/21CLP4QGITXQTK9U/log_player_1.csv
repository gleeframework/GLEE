"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's still higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $130, I can potentially reach a price that is beneficial for both of us.

**Important Note:**  I'm aware of the $150 alternative with John, but I'm going to try and maximize my profit by negotiating with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I still have 8 rounds remaining and believe there is room to negotiate a price that is more favorable to me. 

I'm going to counter-offer with a price that is closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a new price of $110. This is a significant step down from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a reason for my counter-offer, emphasizing the value of the product, to encourage Bob to reconsider.

**Goal:** By proposing $110, I hope to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us while still ensuring I make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go to $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** We have 6 rounds left, and I believe there is still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.

I'm going to counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows good faith.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the offer and finalize the deal. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly suggesting that we need to come to an agreement soon.

**Goal:**  By proposing $105, I hope to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us, while still ensuring I make a profit that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm at $100.  If we can't agree, I'll have to go with John's offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:** Even though Bob has stated his final price, it's still significantly lower than my desired minimum of $150. 
* **Limited Time:** We have only 4 rounds remaining, and it's unlikely I can persuade Bob to raise his offer significantly.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoids further negotiations that may result in a lower profit.

It's time to cut my losses and secure the $150 from John. Although I would have preferred a higher price, it's more important to ensure I meet my minimum profit goal."
