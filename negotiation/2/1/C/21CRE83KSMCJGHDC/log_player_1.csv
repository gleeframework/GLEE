Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think it would be perfect for you!"", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting high, I'm inviting Bob to make a counteroffer, which will reveal how much he's actually willing to pay.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I have the security of knowing John will buy the product for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $100 is still above his perceived value of $80, indicating room for negotiation. 
* **Below My Minimum:** Accepting $100 would mean selling below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting and counteroffering, I can try to meet somewhere in the middle while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on a price above my minimum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $130 is a strong position â€“ it's still a good profit margin for me while being closer to Bob's initial offer than my starting price.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not dropping my price drastically, signaling I'm not desperate to sell below a certain point. I still have the option of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Close Enough:** While I could try to negotiate further, the potential gain is small (only $10). Accepting now secures a reasonable profit.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not be worth the effort for a small potential gain, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer at $120."
