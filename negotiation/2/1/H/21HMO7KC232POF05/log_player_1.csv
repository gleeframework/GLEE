Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than my limit.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product for both of us.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a fair and reasonable price that reflects our mutual goals. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $915,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at this price point.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my acceptable price range, the negotiation is progressing slowly.  It's unlikely we'll reach a deal that's significantly better than $915,000 within the remaining rounds. Selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000 makes more sense at this point to avoid further risk and potential lost opportunity."
