"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product to me is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000.  This is my final offer for today, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than my limit.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product for both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I understand the value you place on the product, $925,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $910,000 for the product. This is a fair and reasonable price that reflects our mutual goals. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
