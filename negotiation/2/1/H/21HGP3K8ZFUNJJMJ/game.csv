"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal given its potential return on investment for you.",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $19,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway? I can let it go for $15,500.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  This price is fair to both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make a deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $13,500 is still cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $14,700.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",14700.0,Alice,5,
