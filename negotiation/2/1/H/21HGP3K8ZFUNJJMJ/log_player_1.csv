Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal given its potential return on investment for you."", ""product_price"": 19000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $19,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  This price is fair to both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.
