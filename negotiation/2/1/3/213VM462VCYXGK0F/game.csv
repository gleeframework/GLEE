"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is only $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really committed to getting this product, but I can only go up to $9,000. Would you consider that? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
