Round 4

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, so a firm but fair counteroffer is in order.  We need to start slowly bringing him closer to our desired outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily moving towards our price point, but we're not in a desperate situation yet. We started very high, so we have room to negotiate down.  It's time to show Bob we're serious but willing to make a small concession to keep the negotiations moving.  We'll aim slightly above the halfway point between his offer and ours to incentivize him."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close to the point where Bob's offer might be more attractive than John's guaranteed offer.  However, we presented our Round 7 offer as our ""final offer.""  We need to hold firm to maintain credibility and signal that we're serious about the $1,450,000 price. This is a calculated risk, but it might be enough to push Bob closer to our desired outcome."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a specific price, but I need to be transparent.  My previous offer was my final concession. I can't justify going any lower than $1,450,000.  I believe in the value this product holds for you, and this is truly my best offer. "",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We are down to the last two rounds. We need to put pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Credibility:**  We emphasized in Round 7 that our offer was final.  Changing the price now weakens our position. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob walks away, but there's also a chance this firm stance pushes him to accept our offer.  We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk is calculated."
