Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this presents a fair deal considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, so I can afford to aim high with Bob.

By starting at $1,400,000, I have a good chance of:

1. **Bob accepts:** I secure a profit of $200,000 above my minimum.
2. **Bob negotiates:** We potentially settle on a price between $1,400,000 and $1,200,000, still earning me a good profit."
