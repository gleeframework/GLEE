Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable, and I'm open to discussing this further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is well above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product to Bob and the potential for a good deal.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I show I'm willing to negotiate, but not desperate.
* **Plan B:** I have a fallback option (selling to John) so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit while keeping the negotiation open and leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from a successful transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a counteroffer that is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like I'm genuinely trying to reach an agreement.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and the potential benefits for him. 
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** I highlight the idea of finding a solution that benefits both of us, further emphasizing my desire to reach a deal.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap and nudge Bob closer to my desired price without being too aggressive or unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's the maximum I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product, especially since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while giving me a return that makes this deal worthwhile.  Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm framing this as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and making Bob feel like he's getting the best possible deal.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob why this price is justified. 
* **Win-Win Focus:** I emphasize that this price is a win for both of us, allowing us to close the deal and move forward.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob to the limit while still leaving a small window for negotiation. It positions the price as a fair compromise and highlights the benefits of reaching an agreement."
