"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise. This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects that. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
