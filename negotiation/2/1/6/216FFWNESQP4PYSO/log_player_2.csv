"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise. This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects that. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

At this point, Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price.  John's offer is the best option for Bob to get the product within his budget."
