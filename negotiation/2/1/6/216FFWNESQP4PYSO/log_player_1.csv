Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to pay more.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm framing the offer as an opportunity for discussion, suggesting flexibility. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize my profit with the possibility of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm ready to offer $10,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so there's no immediate need to settle for a lower price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and aim for a higher price without losing the opportunity to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to work with you, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair compromise. This product is truly valuable, and I believe this price reflects that. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining my profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I'm framing the counter-offer as a compromise, suggesting that it's a reasonable price for both parties.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground with Bob while keeping the negotiation moving towards my desired outcome. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
