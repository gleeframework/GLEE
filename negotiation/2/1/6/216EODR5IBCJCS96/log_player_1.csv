Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  $8,000 is too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I am interested in purchasing the product, I am unable to go above $8,500. Could we meet somewhere in the middle?

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  $8,500 is closer, but I think I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we could find common ground. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,650. I hope this works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, this is a good deal and I'm running out of time.  It's better than selling to John for $10,000 and taking a loss."
