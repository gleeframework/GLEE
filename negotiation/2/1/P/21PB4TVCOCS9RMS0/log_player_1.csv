Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, which might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $150, so I can always walk away if Bob's counteroffers get too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Upside:**  I can't get a better price from Bob, and there's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing him as a buyer.
* **John is a Backup:**  Even though John is a backup option, I'm secure in knowing I can sell to him if this deal falls through."
