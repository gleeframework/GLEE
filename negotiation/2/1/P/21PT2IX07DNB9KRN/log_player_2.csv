"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's room for negotiation.  I want to try to get the price down further."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. While I do see the value in the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value it holds for you, while also being a fair price for me.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,000,000 to $950,000. That's a good sign, but I believe I can still negotiate a lower price.  I'm going to make a counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is within my budget and a good compromise. I've already gotten a significant discount from her initial offer. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's time to accept and secure the product."
