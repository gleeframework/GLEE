{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point.**  It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and straightforward.** It highlights potential value for Bob without being overly aggressive. 
* **This strategy aims to:**
    *  Get a quick agreement if Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his initial estimate.
    *  Open up a negotiation if he's hesitant, allowing for a potential compromise. 
    *  Provide a solid starting point for counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see if Bob is truly willing to go higher. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Gain leverage:** Bob now knows I'm serious about my initial asking price.
* **Open up a counter-offer:**  I can test the waters with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  If negotiations fail, I still have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $11,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer close to my minimum:**  $11,500 is a significant step up from Bob's offer, but still less than my original asking price.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while maintaining my bottom line.
* **Emphasize the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, encouraging him to see the value in a slightly higher price.
* **""Meet in the middle"" phrasing:**  This is a common negotiation tactic to make the offer seem more fair and reasonable. 
* **Keep the option open:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can still make a higher counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly holding to his $10,000 offer.  It's clear he won't budge, and further negotiation is unlikely to get me closer to my desired price. 

Selling to John at $15,000 is the best option:

* **Guaranteed profit:**  It meets my minimum price requirement and ensures a good profit.
* **Saves time and effort:**  Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **Minimizes risk:**  John's offer is secure, unlike Bob's, which is uncertain and potentially leads to a loss."
