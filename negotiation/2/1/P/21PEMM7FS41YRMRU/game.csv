"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $11,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
