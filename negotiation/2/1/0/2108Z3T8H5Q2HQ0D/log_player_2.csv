"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $125. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice's offer of $125 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Since your goal is to save money and you're willing to buy from another seller, going with John is the most financially sound choice."
