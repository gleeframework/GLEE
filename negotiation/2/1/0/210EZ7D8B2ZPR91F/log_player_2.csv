"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,200,000 is getting closer, but to make this work, I'd need to see it at $1,700,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,700,000.  Since I can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
