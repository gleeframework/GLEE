"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price range. You can potentially negotiate a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate further to avoid losing the sale to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $900,000.  While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up buying from John for a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking a longer negotiation."
