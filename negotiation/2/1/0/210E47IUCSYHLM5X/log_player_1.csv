{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $115 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than your minimum but leaves room for bargaining.  It also expresses confidence in the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we discuss a price of $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is higher than John's offer, it is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $105?  It's still a great price considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to stick to my budget. Could we negotiate at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the same price as John's offer. This means there's no benefit to further negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer allows you to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price."
