# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

While $140 is a good deal, it's still above your target of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $130. I can meet you halfway and offer you the product for $137.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $137.50 is still within your budget and is a better price than John's offer.  It's worth accepting to save some money."
