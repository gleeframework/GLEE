"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
