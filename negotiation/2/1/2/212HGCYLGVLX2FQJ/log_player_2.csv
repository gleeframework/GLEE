"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but it's still above her minimum value.**  You can likely get a better price by negotiating.
* **Buying from John is too expensive.**  You have room to negotiate with Alice before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to part with it for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** It's a compromise that meets you halfway from your last offer. 
* **Buying from John is still too expensive.** This price from Alice is significantly lower.
* **You've already rejected one offer.**  Continuing to haggle might risk Alice withdrawing the offer entirely."
