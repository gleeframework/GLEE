"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $14,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $14,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,
