Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you're not losing money even if Bob declines. Aiming higher initially allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might be even higher than Bob's perceived $8,000, justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:**  The ""one-time offer"" wording adds a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough that Bob might accept."
