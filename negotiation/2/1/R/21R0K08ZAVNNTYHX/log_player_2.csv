"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $17,000. I know it's a valuable item and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is looking to save money, and Alice's initial offer is too high. It's best to reject and see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $15,500?  This would still be a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum.  He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
