"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $17,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $14,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $15,500?  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
