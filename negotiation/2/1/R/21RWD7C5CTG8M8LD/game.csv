"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits it could bring to my business.

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1500000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm close to considering John's offer, but I'd rather work with you. Can you consider this offer?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1700000. I believe the product's value and potential benefits to your business justify this price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $1650000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already met you halfway twice, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to pay $1500000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider John's offer. Can you reconsider?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
