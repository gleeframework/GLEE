Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $120, but I'm willing to negotiate. Offering $100 allows for some room to compromise if Bob counters.  I'll keep an eye on John's offer as well, and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only able to pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I'll keep John's offer of $120 in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I'm still unable to go above $90 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $92 is still below my minimum desired price of $120, it's getting closer. At this point,  I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $92.  It's a better outcome than selling to John for $120, and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or him walking away altogether."
