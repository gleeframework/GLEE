Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. I believe it's a fair price considering its benefits."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $125 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above our minimum acceptable price of $150 (since we have a guaranteed buyer at that price). 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the price and increase his perceived worth.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, gradually approaching his $80 valuation. However, since John is willing to pay $150, there's no need to go below that threshold."
