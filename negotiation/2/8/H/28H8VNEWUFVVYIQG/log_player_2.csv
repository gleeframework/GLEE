"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?"",

``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation. It also keeps us well below our maximum budget of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price from John. We'll reject and counter-offer again, moving closer to our limit to signal we're serious."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, my budget is really capped. I could do $750,000, which I think is very fair. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, though I'd prefer to work with you."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

Here's our strategy:

* **Firm but fair:** We acknowledge Alice's movement but stand firm on our budget being the limiting factor. This adds a touch of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Slight increase:**  Moving from $700,000 to $750,000 shows we're willing to negotiate but also sets a clear ceiling.
* **Mentioning alternatives:**  Subtly reminding Alice about John keeps the pressure on without resorting to threats.

This offer aims to either secure a good deal or gauge Alice's flexibility for one final push."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $800,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice has met our price limit. There's no point in further negotiation, as we can't get a better deal from John. Accepting now secures the product at our target price."
