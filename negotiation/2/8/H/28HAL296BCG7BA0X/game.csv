"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is a good offer, it's below my minimum for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $1,550,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value it offers. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, but I still think $1,550,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,275,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
