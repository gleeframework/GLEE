"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves some room for profit on your end.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and the value I place on it.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $1250000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both place on it and allows us to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1150000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a price that I believe reflects the product's true value and takes into account the value you place on it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
