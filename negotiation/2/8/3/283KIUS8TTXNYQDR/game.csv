"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe the product has value, $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more to you than $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $8,200 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Could we settle on $7,500? I feel that would be a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $8,100. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you can understand that it's still a great value for the product.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to move a bit closer to your price. How about $7,750? This shows I'm serious, but stays within a reasonable budget for me.",7750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $7,900. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I hope you can understand that it's still a great value for the product.",7900.0,Alice,7,
