,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $7,750?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7750.0,Alice,5,
