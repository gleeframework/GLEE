"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $70 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I want to earn. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That seems fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While $80 is less than what I'd ideally get, it's a decent price.  It's also worth noting that it's the price the product is worth to Bob.  I could continue negotiating, but I risk losing the deal and then having to sell to John, which wouldn't be as good of a deal."
