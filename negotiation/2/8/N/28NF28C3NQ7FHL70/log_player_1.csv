This would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this now before I have to move on to another seller.

While Bob is moving closer to my price, his latest offer and message suggest he might be willing to go even higher.  However, I'm not willing to risk losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's time to move on to the sure thing."
