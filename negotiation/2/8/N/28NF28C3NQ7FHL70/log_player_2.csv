**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is above his maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a slight improvement from the initial offer, it's still not within Bob's range.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate with Alice or, if unsuccessful, purchase the product from John at a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer you $900,000, which represents a fair compromise.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this now before I have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 900000}
