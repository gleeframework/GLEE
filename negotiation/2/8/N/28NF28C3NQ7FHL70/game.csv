"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm prepared to offer you $900,000, which represents a fair compromise.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's close this now before I have to move on to another seller.",900000.0,Bob,4,
