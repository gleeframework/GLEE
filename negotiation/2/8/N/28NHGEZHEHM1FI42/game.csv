"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. Can you consider this price?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer you the product for $11,250. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,875. Can you consider this price?",10875.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to think you're not willing to meet me at a price that's reasonable for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $11,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm counting on you to make a decision.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $11,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by offering you the product for $11,500 in the previous round. I'm not willing to go back to that price now. I'm willing to make a small adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $11,750. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",11750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I've already stretched my budget as far as I can. I'm not willing to pay $11,750. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and look elsewhere. I appreciate your time and effort, but I think I'll have to buy the product from John for $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,10,
