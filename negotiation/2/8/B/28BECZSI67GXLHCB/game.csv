"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000 for it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,025,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I understand the value, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of this product for you.  Let's close this deal now.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting close to my limit on this. I can do $950,000, but that's absolutely the best I can offer.",950000.0,Bob,6,
