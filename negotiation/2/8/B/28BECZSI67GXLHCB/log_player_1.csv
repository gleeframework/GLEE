"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This initial offer is a significant discount for Bob, but still leaves a healthy profit margin for you. It demonstrates you're open to negotiation while starting strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than your ideal price, it's still above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price. There are still rounds left, and you might be able to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,025,000? This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I understand the value, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to your desired price, but $925,000 is still below your ideal value for the product. With several rounds remaining, it's worth continuing the negotiation and trying to push for a higher price. You could potentially close the deal for a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a very fair price, considering the value of this product for you.  Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit on this. I can do $950,000, but that's absolutely the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is very close to your desired price.  It's a good compromise that secures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
