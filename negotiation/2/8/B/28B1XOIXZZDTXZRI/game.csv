"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit below your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  It's clear we both value this product highly, but we seem to be at an impasse.  Given this, I'm prepared to accept a final price of $1250000 to close this deal. This reflects both of our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1250000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1200000, but I'd like to add a condition: if I buy the product within the next 48 hours, I'd like a 2% discount. This would bring the price down to $1184000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
