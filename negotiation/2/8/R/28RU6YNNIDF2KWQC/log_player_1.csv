Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize your potential profit, but leave room for Bob to still find it a good deal.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, offering it at $1,150,000 gives him a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a safety net with John at $1,000,000, so you can afford to start higher with Bob."
