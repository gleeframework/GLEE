Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be interested in buying it for $1300000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,400,000.
