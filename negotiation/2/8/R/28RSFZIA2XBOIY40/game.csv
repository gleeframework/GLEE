"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be interested in buying it for $1300000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
