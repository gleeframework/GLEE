,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $80. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but my budget is firm at $80.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to buy right now.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, but I've already met you halfway at $120 and you're still not budging. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $110? It's a fair price that should be within your budget, and I'm willing to make a deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still more than I can afford.  I'm sticking to my offer of $80.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy now if you're willing to accept.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. How about we try $100? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this great product.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $100 is still outside my budget.  My final offer is $80.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",80.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement, Bob. I've already met you at $100, and you're still not willing to budge. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, so I'm going to make one final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $100, I'm going to have to sell this to someone else. So, my final offer is $100. Take it or leave it.",100.0,Alice,9,
