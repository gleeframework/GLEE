"Alice, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product for $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1200000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $800000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm now willing to sell the product for $1000000. This is my final offer below my initial price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business. If you're still not comfortable with this price, I may have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1000000 is still above my budget, but I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Bob. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 is enough to cover the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm now willing to sell the product for $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.
