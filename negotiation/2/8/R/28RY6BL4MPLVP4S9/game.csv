"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still outside of my budget. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price given my budget constraints and the value I place on the product. I believe this offer demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to stretch your budget to make this deal work, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one, so I'm counteroffering $1,000,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still working with a limited budget. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $975,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is as high as I can go. It's a fair compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000, so I'm counteroffering $987,500. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",987500.0,Alice,7,
