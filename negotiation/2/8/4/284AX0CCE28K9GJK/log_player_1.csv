Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Limited-Time Pressure:** By mentioning other interested buyers, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Justification of Value:** While not explicitly stating the worth to Bob, the message implies the product's high value, justifying the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer outright. You need to weigh the potential for a higher profit against the certainty of John's $10,000 offer."
