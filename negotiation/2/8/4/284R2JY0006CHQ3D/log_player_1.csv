Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high, but be believable:** Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($150) maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave room for negotiation (optional):** While not strictly necessary in this scenario, a slightly higher initial offer could allow for a back-and-forth if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Highlight value:**  Instead of focusing on price alone, emphasize the value the product brings to encourage Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob's willingness to pay, you could potentially adjust your offer for even higher profit."
