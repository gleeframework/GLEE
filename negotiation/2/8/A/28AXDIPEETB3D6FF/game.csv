"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a competitive offer considering its value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits to my business. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a solid price that reflects the value I'm placing on the product, and it gives us both room for a win-win scenario. Let's make this deal happen!",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price down to $1,025,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in round 2. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
