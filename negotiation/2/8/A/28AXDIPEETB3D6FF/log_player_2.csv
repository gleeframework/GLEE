"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000, which is a competitive offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits to my business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above my target price of $1,000,000.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate. I've left room for potential compromise in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $1,000,000, even though she has lowered it. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a solid price that reflects the value I'm placing on the product, and it gives us both room for a win-win scenario. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually increasing my offer while still being below my target price. This counteroffer is a significant step closer to my target, and I'm hoping to encourage Alice to accept.  The message is positive and emphasizes a win-win scenario, which might help sway her decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the price down to $1,025,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in round 2. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original counteroffer of $1,050,000 and stated it's her final concession.  This is getting very close to my target price of $1,000,000.  While I'd love to get it even lower, I'm concerned about losing the deal entirely if I reject her offer and she holds firm.  This is a good opportunity to secure the product at a price that's within a reasonable range of my target."
