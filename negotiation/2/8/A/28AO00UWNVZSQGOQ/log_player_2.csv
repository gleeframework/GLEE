"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, close to my maximum budget. There's significant room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fairer price considering your valuation."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I am serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  We're still significantly above her valuation. I'll continue negotiating to try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about $7,500? That's a solid offer and would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between the last round of offers. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at $7,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned you place on the product, and it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is sticking to a slow concession strategy.  While $8,200 is getting closer, it's still important to push for a better deal. We're getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,800?  That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

This offer again splits the difference from the previous round, maintaining a consistent negotiation style. The message also introduces a sense of urgency and emphasizes the desire to reach a deal. We're getting into the later rounds, so trying to close the gap is important."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,100. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling this is her final offer. While it's not the absolute lowest price I could potentially negotiate, it's a reasonable deal and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to settle for the more expensive option."
