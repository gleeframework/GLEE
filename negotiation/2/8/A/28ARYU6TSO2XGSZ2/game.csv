"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a reasonable price for both of us, I think.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $105 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we meet at $110? I think that's a fair price for the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,5,
