"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his potential range might be. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also aware that I have John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I want to gauge how serious he is about buying the product and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $18,000. This is a reasonable compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a better price than John's offer, but I'm getting closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm only on round 4.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting offers, I might end up with a lower price or run out of rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a good deal."
