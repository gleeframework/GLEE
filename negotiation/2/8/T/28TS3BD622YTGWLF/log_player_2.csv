Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $90. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $85. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it hard to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85, and it's better to secure the product for $80 from John than to continue negotiating for a potentially small saving."
