"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something that would be worth $1,500,000 in your hands. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to facilitate this deal. This still leaves room for you to make a significant profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
