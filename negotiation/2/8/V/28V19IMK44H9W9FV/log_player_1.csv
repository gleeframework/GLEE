Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can do better with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $900,000. Can you consider my revised offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $900,000 is closer to what I want, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my target price.  I'm not going to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, I'm still firm on the value of this product.  $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the unique benefits it offers.  I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000, meeting you halfway again.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is closer to your original offer. Can you consider my revised offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $920,000 is getting close to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there.  $920,000 is a good offer, but I'm still just a little bit off on my desired price.  How about we split the difference one more time and settle on $935,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $935,000, which would be $927,500. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $927,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob seems unwilling to budge further. It's better to accept a guaranteed $1,000,000 than risk getting a lower offer in the next round."
