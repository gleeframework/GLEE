"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth that price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand we both have a price in mind, Alice. How about $98? That's a fair compromise.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $98 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $101.50.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",101.5,Alice,5,
