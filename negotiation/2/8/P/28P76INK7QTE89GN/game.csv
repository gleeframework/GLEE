"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. This would be a more comfortable price for me, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This price still gives you a considerable profit, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
