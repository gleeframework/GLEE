Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible from Bob, knowing John is a guaranteed backup. 
* **Starting High:** An initial offer of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if Bob doesn't perceive the full million-dollar worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal that Alice is open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to find a sweet spot: high enough that Bob might accept, generating more profit than John, but not so high that it immediately scares him off."
