"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  Let's work together to make this happen.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“  how about $85? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $78, and I think that's a fair price.",78.0,Bob,6,
