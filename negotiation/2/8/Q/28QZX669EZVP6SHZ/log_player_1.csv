"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My starting price is $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and creates the impression that I'm confident in the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to establish a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Leaving Room:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, giving us both space to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! However, $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $65 is significantly below my minimum of $100 and even below the value to Bob ($80).
* **Negotiation is possible.** I'm not desperate for a sale, so I can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating. 
* **Exploring Higher Options:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my target price or at least my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $65 is too far below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, but still remaining above my minimum.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""work together"" to emphasize a collaborative approach.
* **Opportunity for Agreement:**  This counteroffer provides a reasonable price point that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $75?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $75 is still below the value to Bob ($80) and significantly below my minimum of $100.
* **Exploring Higher Options:** I want to see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price range before resorting to selling to John.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I show Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“  how about $85? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm continuing to compromise by offering a price midway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than he's offering and that he's getting a good deal at $85.
* **Final Push:** This offer is a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob before potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $78, and I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:** While $78 is closer to my minimum of $100, it's still below my desired price.
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** There's not much room for further compromise without going below my minimum. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a price below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
