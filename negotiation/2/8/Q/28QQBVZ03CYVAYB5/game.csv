Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1500000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1200000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1175000. This is still a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1175000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to go up to $1100000, which is a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
