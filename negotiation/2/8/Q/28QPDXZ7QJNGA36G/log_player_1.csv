"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $8,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'll accept $12,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit over my budget, though. Would you be willing to accept $10000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum price and it's the same as what John is willing to pay.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the hassle of further negotiation."
