``` 

**Explanation:**

Accepting Alice's offer at $1,200,000 is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Savings:**  Bob saves $300,000 compared to buying from John ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000).
* **Value:** While the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, it's worth $1,500,000 to Bob.  Buying from Alice at $1,200,000 still leaves Bob with a significant profit."
