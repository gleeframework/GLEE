Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,000,000.  To make this a swift and mutually beneficial deal, I'm offering it to you for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This means you have leverage to aim higher.
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value allows you to gauge his eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Justification:** While the offer is high, you can justify it by emphasizing the product's value and the fact that you're offering him a first-mover advantage.

**Important:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, you have room to negotiate down towards his $1,000,000 valuation, knowing you have John as a safety net."
