Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal selling price before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, I want to see if I can get closer to my minimum value of $80. I'll try to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $95. This is still above my minimum value of $80 and closer to what I'd like to get. Hopefully, this price is appealing enough for Bob to accept, but it also leaves some room for further negotiation if he counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $90 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my ideal selling price. I'm willing to close the deal rather than risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
