"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $8,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,750? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that we've been going back and forth, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to get this deal done. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal closed.",11250.0,Alice,9,
