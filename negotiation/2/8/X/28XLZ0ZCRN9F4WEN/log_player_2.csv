"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for much less. It makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $8,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price. John is still an option, and Bob can always buy the product from him if he can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,500? It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is getting closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get closer to his desired price of $10,000. He has plenty of rounds left and can always buy from John if he can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  How about we settle at $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,750? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's getting close to his budget, but $11,750 is still too high. He has a few more rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John if he can't reach a deal with Alice. He should continue trying to get closer to his desired price of $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to feel like we're just going in circles. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go any higher than $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we've been going back and forth, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one final concession to try to get this deal done. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's closer to my minimum. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal closed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While $11,250 is tempting, it's still above his budget and only one round remains. He's already made his final offer and Alice seems unwilling to budge. It's better to secure the product from John at a price he's comfortable with, rather than risking getting stuck with a price that's higher than he'd like."
