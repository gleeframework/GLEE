"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm happy to buy the product, but I'm going to need to come in at a lower price point.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your willingness to negotiate. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, I'm confident that the true value of this product to your operations will become evident very quickly. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,275,000. I believe this price point reflects the value you'll be gaining.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While I recognize the value of this product, $1,275,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,237,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing us to finalize the deal.",1237500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  I've taken your latest offer into consideration.  To move things forward, I'd be willing to settle at $1,255,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",1255000.0,Alice,5,
