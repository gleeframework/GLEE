# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should try to negotiate further to get a price closer to his maximum."
