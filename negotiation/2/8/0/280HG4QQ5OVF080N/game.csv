"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for the value this product brings.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
