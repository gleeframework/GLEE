"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 to start the negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's intrinsic value and market potential warrant a significantly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's worth and offers a solid investment opportunity.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,300,000 is still too far away from what I'm willing to pay.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 doesn't make sense for me.  If you're willing to consider a counteroffer of $725,000, I'm ready to move forward. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your budgetary concerns.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, my budget is firm, and I can't go above $800,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $750,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
