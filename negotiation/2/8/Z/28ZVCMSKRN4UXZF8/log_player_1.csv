Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, $1,500,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000 to start the negotiation.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's intrinsic value and market potential warrant a significantly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $1,300,000 is still too far away from what I'm willing to pay.  To be frank, anything above $800,000 doesn't make sense for me.  If you're willing to consider a counteroffer of $725,000, I'm ready to move forward. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly stating his upper limit is $800,000. We're still in early rounds and have room to negotiate. While John offers a safe $1,000,000, it's worth trying to get closer to Bob's $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations.  I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still acknowledging your budgetary concerns."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation window, so it's time to signal firmness while still offering a concession. By going to $1,000,000 (our own guaranteed sale price with John), we're showing we're serious but leaving ourselves some wiggle room if Bob negotiates up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, my budget is firm, and I can't go above $800,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $750,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now firmly stated his maximum price twice and is signaling his intent to walk away. While we could try to negotiate further, it's highly unlikely we'll bridge the gap between $750,000 and $1,000,000 in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away and leaving us with nothing."
