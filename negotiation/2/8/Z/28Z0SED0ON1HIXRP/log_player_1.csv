Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a strategic move to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd like a bit more, this offer is close to my target and I'm not confident I can get much higher in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the sale than risk losing a deal completely."
