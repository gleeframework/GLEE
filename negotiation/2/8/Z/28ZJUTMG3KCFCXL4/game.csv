"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000.  This is still a great deal for you as it's well over my maximum budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, this product's value is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table. ",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price. However,  $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement. ",1500000.0,Bob,4,
