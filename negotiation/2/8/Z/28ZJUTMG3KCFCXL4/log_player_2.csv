Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, this product's value is considerably higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  I could consider letting it go for $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, as you're still significantly below your maximum budget and she's shown a willingness to come down."
