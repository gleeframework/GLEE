However, I can still make a counteroffer to Alice. Here it is:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $975,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}"
