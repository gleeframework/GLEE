Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $85 is only slightly below my initial counteroffer and a significant improvement over his previous offer. I'd rather get $85 than risk losing him completely and having to settle for $80 from John."
