"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my best and final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not acceptable. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's try to close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again.",925000.0,Bob,6,
