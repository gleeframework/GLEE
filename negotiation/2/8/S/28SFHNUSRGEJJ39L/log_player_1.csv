"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, there's room for negotiation, but I want to see if I can secure a good price right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good starting point, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but still aim for a profit. I'll offer him a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above his.  Let's see if he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me, and it's likely I won't be able to get a better price from Bob. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."
