"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $80.  Alice's offer of $90 is higher than your limit.  While Alice's offer might be a ""great deal"" for her, it's not a good deal for you.  Since John is selling the product for your maximum price of $80, it's better to reject Alice's offer."
