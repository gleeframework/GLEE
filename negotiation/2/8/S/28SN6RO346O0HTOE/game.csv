"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,000,000 to $1,100,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price within this range. Looking forward to your response.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1,150,000 for the product. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
