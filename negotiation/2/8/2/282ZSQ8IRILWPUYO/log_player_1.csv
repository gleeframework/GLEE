``` 

This is a starting point, as I'm aiming to maximize my profit. Since I know John will buy the product for $150, I'm starting high. However, I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $105 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120. I'll counter again with a price that's still reasonable for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50.  Let's make this deal happen! "", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am comfortable paying $110 for the product. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $120, $110 is a good compromise.  It's a better deal than what John would pay, and it helps me avoid the risk of further negotiation."
