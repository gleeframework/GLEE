**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering the product for $13,500. While this is a better deal than buying from John, you can still potentially get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or see if John is willing to lower his price."
