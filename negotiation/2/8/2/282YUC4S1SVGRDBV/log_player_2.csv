"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first. $130 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low but reasonable:**  I'm starting with an offer that's the same as Alice's value for the product.  This might be accepted outright, and even if not, it sets a strong anchoring point for further negotiation. 
* **Polite and direct:** The message is framed politely to maintain a good negotiating relationship. 
* **Room to negotiate:**  This offer leaves room to come up a bit if Alice rejects it. I'm aiming to find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price I'd consider, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to meet her halfway between our last two offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $107?"",
""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly halfway between our previous offers ($100 and $115), I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise and find a fair deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps me well below my maximum budget of $150 while still potentially being attractive enough for Alice to accept. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** Offering a counter-proposal keeps the negotiation moving forward and avoids a stalemate."
