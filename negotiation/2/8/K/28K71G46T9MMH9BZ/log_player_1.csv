Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the value to Bob increases the chance of him accepting or making a counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The starting price isn't too aggressive, allowing for potential back-and-forth without risking immediate rejection. 
* **John as Safety Net:** Knowing John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for significantly less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. There's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **John's offer provides leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer gives me the confidence to push for a higher price. 

I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to bridge the gap while staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more for the product. Given its value to you and its potential for your business, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $1,150,000? It's still within a reasonable range, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Reasonable Range:**  $1,150,000 remains within a reasonable range, considering both Bob's budget and my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Signal:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to reaching an agreement, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,075,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  Even though Bob is trying to meet me halfway, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Limit:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will come closer to my desired price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and a significant profit. 

It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer who's willing to pay my desired price."
