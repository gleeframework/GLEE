"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we start at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $18,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time at $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,5,
