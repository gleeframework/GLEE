Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a decent amount, it's significantly lower than my desired price. I believe I can still get closer to my target value by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the product's value and leaves room for further negotiation."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
