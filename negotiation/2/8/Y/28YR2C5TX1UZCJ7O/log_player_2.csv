"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $100 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you can get a better price. Alice is likely open to negotiation, and by rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get the product for closer to her $80 value."
