"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $8000 to make this worthwhile. How about $8500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $7500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8000.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you on the budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8000.  Let's split the difference - how about $8250?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
