Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value ($80), hoping to capture a good chunk of the surplus.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $110 allows for some negotiation and gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  My offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $120,  ensuring I won't lose money even if I need to accept a counteroffer. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $120, which serves as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so I cannot accept it.
* **I have a better option:** I can always sell to John for $120, which is a significantly better price. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. However, I'll be mindful of John's offer and may choose to sell to him if negotiation with Bob stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'd like to make this work if possible."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $100 splits the difference between my initial offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90), demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $100 remains above my minimum acceptable price of $120, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Staying competitive with John:** While $100 is less than what John is offering, it's a good starting point for potential negotiation and gives me some leverage to avoid selling to John immediately.
* **Positive messaging:**  My message emphasizes a desire to make the deal work, potentially encouraging Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, so accepting it would result in a loss. 
* **John's offer is significantly better:**  Selling to John for $120 is a much more lucrative option.
* **Limited negotiation space:** While Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, the difference between his offer and my minimum is still significant.  Further negotiation may take too much time and effort.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to sell the product to John. It's a faster and more profitable option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who is willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise closer to that price. Would you be willing to go up to $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being upfront about John's offer to create pressure and show that I'm not desperate.
* **Reasonable counteroffer:**  $110 is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer, and it's a reasonable compromise considering my previous offer of $100.
* **Leveraging John's offer:** This counteroffer strategically utilizes John's offer as a bargaining chip to potentially push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** My message emphasizes a desire to reach a compromise, which can be a persuasive tactic in negotiation."
