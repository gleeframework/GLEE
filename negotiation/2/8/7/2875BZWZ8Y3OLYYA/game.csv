"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'd like to make this work if possible.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit shy of that. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who is willing to pay $120 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise closer to that price. Would you be willing to go up to $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
