"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,800,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as it represents a substantial reduction on my end while acknowledging the value you'll gain from it.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal. While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $1,350,000. This reflects a significant investment on my part, and I hope we can finalize an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
