"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($10,000). It's a significant drop from her initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. Accepting $11,000 would be leaving potential savings on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?"",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($11,000) and your previous counteroffer ($10,500). This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a better price."
