"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  How about we meet halfway at $13,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $12,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",12500.0,Bob,4,
