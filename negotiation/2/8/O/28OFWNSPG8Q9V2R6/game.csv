"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's still a good price for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $12,500 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $11,000?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low. How about we split the difference at $11,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about we settle at $11,200? That's a very fair offer and shows I'm committed to making this deal work.",11200.0,Bob,6,
