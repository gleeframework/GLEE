{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $125 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than my minimum but still lower than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and makes it more likely he'll accept, but still allows me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $125 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but I can only go up to $110. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, but I can still try to get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $115.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
