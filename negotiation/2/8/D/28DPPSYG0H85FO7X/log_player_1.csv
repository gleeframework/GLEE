Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation with Bob close to that amount. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,450,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a substantial profit.
* **Value proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by securing the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a safety net with John's offer."
