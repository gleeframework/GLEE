""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * **Bob:**  Gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him.
    * **Alice:** Earns $150,000 more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
