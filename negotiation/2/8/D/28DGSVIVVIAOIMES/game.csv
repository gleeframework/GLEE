"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,150,000? I'm confident this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, thanks for your continued negotiation. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I still need a bit more to make this work on my end. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
