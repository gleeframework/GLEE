"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $600000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800000 to you. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $600000 is still a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product,  which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $550000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $550000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $525000?  That's a reasonable compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $525000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $575000. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made. What do you think?",575000.0,Alice,5,
