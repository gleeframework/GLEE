"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is less than John's price, it's still more than what Bob wants to pay. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation going, potentially leading to a price closer to Bob's desired price."
