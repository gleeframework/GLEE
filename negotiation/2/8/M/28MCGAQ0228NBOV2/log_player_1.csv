Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your value:** You value the product at $10,000. 
* **John's value:** John is your safety net and will buy the product for $10,000.

This means there is a potential profit range of $4,000 between your value and Bob's. By offering $14,000, you are:

* **Maximizing your potential profit:** You are aiming for the highest possible profit within the range, leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Minimizing the risk of rejection:** The offer is attractive enough for Bob, but not so high that he'd be unwilling to pay.

If Bob rejects, you can fall back on John's offer, ensuring a profit of $10,000."
