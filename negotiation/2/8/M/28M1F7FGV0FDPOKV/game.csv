"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
