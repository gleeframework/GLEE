"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true market value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, I'm unlikely to get him much higher than $1,400,000. Selling to John guarantees the $1,500,000 and avoids the risk of Bob not increasing his offer further."
