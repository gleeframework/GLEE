"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll be pleased with its performance. I'm asking for $2,000,000  to start negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true market value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being within a reasonable range for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
