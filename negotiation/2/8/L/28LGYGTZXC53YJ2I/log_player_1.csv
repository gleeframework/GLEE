"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm not sure I'll get much higher. It's better to take the $140 now than to risk getting a lower offer or ending up selling to John for the same amount."
