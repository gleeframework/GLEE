"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could come down to $12,000, but that's my absolute lowest. It's a fair price reflecting the true value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
