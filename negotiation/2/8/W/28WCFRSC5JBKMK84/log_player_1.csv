"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a good profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness and potential value to Bob. This is meant to pique his interest and make him consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to discuss the price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just the first step.  I'll be monitoring Bob's responses and adjusting my strategy based on his reactions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I am willing to pay $1800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not ideal. I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Value of the Product:** I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,800,000.  I don't want to sell it for less than I believe it's worth. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I want to maximize my profits.  I'm willing to take a chance on getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. It's a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not going all the way down to Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's unique value, subtly reinforcing my position.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm using language that suggests a desire to finalize the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. This strategy will allow me to maximize profits while also minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the current market and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1750000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowering:**  Bob's offer is even lower than his previous offer, which is concerning. It shows he's pushing for a lower price.
* **Close to Minimum:**  While $1,750,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Risk of John:** Selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob.  
* **Counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.

**Strategy:** This round is risky. I need to find a balance between getting a good price and potentially losing the deal.  I'm going to make a slightly lower counteroffer, but not too low, to see if I can get Bob to move up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. My product is genuinely unique and worth the price I'm asking for. Let's meet in the middle at $1,850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it will ensure we can finalize the deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Pressure:** This message is more assertive, putting the onus on Bob to close the deal. I'm reminding him of the potential loss.
* **Middle Ground Again:** I'm proposing a middle ground, but this time with less wiggle room. I'm making it clear I won't go much lower.
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes finality and urgency to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**  I'm pushing for a decision in this round. If Bob rejects, I'm going to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm running out of negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I appreciate your product, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate.  Bob is firm on $1,800,000, and I'm unlikely to get him to budge further. 
* **Risk of John:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of losing the deal with Bob and being forced to sell to John for $1,500,000 is very real.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer will still result in a significant profit. 

**Strategy:**  This is a calculated decision to minimize potential loss. It's better to secure a good profit now than risk getting nothing at all."
