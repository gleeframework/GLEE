Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not too high that it makes him immediately reject it. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $17500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15200 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price and close to the price John is offering. It's not ideal, but it's a good outcome considering the negotiation process. I'll accept the offer and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting further counteroffers or losing the deal entirely."
