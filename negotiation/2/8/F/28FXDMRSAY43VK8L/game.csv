"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm starting the price at $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,150,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $900,000? This would allow me to make a more feasible decision.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. While $900,000 is a significant undervaluation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that the product's value aligns better with a price closer to $850,000. I hope this suggestion will facilitate our negotiation process.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down slightly to $980,000.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",980000.0,Alice,5,
