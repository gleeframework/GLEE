Thanks for the offer Alice.  $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $16000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.,16000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we split the difference at $18000?  This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Bob,4,
