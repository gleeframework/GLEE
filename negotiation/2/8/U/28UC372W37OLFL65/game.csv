"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $700,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial price.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $700,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $550,000.  Let me know what you think.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $650,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $600,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $630,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",630000.0,Alice,5,
