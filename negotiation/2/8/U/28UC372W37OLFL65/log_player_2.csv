Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $625,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, so I hope we can meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling she's nearing her bottom line. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice will become less flexible. Accepting at $625,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer."
