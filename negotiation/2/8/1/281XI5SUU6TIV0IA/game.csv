"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $800,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. That's closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $725,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to accept $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems like we're close. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? That would be my final offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $775,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $850,000, but I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much further I can go.",850000.0,Alice,7,
