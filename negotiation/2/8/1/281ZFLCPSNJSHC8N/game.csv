"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as high as $9,750, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer the product to you for $10,250. This is still a good deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10250.0,Alice,5,
