"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiating from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is still too high. He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $925,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He should continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to accept $875,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to your original offer.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best deal he's gotten so far.  While $900,000 is still above his ideal price point, it's a good compromise, and he can save $300,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee.  Continuing to negotiate could also risk Alice walking away from the deal completely."
