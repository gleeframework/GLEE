"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to negotiating from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. It's a fair price for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. Let's make this happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not ready to accept $875,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's getting close to your original offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
