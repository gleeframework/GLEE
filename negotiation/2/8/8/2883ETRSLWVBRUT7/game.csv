"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10500? I'm very interested in your product, but my budget is tight.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $10500 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11000. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. How about $10750?  It's a compromise, and I really want to get your product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10875 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Could we do $10700?  I'm confident we can close a deal at this price, and it would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10700.0,Bob,6,
