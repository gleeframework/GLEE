Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10500? I'm very interested in your product, but my budget is tight.  Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000.  I'm confident I can counteroffer in a way that still keeps Bob interested while inching closer to my goal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $10,500 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the ""fair profit"" aspect, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. How about $10750?  It's a compromise, and I really want to get your product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident I can do better with a counteroffer. I'm willing to compromise further, but I won't settle for anything less than $11,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,875. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10875}
```

I'm coming down a bit more, but I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. I'm using the ""fair compromise"" language again to appeal to Bob's sense of equity. By offering $10,875, I'm also showing that I'm willing to negotiate realistically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10875 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Could we do $10700?  I'm confident we can close a deal at this price, and it would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,700.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,700

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $12,000. 

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I've reached a point where I'm not willing to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John, and I'm comfortable walking away from this deal. It's important to know when to cut your losses and move on to a more promising opportunity."
