"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John for $10,000. Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500? I'm very interested in your product, but my budget is tight.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above his maximum budget. This shows he's serious about buying the product but also wants to save money. The message is friendly and emphasizes his budget constraint."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $10500 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11000. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He has several rounds left and knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  He's not under pressure to accept yet, so he'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. How about $10,750?  It's a compromise, and I really want to get your product.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating that he's serious about buying the product. However, he's still keeping it below $11,000, showing that he's not willing to budge too much. The message focuses on finding a compromise and emphasizes Bob's desire to get the product."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  $10,875 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  Could we do $10,700?
