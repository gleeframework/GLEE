"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000?  It's a fair price that gives you a significant value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe that $800,000 would be a fair price for both parties involved. I hope you can consider this amount as it aligns closely with my budgetary constraints. Looking forward to your response.",800000.0,Bob,4,
