Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) but still gives me a decent profit. It also leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **The message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:** A reasonable opening offer encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The price is not too low, allowing for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Maintain a backup option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000. Would you be willing to adjust your offer accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's more than what the product is worth to him, it's still not enough for me to make a decent profit. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore further negotiation:** I can counteroffer and try to reach a price that is more acceptable to me. 
* **Preserve my backup option:** If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can still sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $900,000?  It's a fair price that gives you a significant value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but lower than my previous offer.  It shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, while still securing a profit for me.
* **The message:** I acknowledge Bob's constraints while highlighting the value he'll get at this price. I frame it as a ""fair price"" to encourage him to consider it.

**Strategy:**

* **Show flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates I am willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:**  $900,000 is still higher than Bob's initial offer, showing that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This price could still be adjusted in the following rounds, if necessary.
* **Preserve my backup option:** I can still sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe that $800,000 would be a fair price for both parties involved. I hope you can consider this amount as it aligns closely with my budgetary constraints. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is insistent on $800,000, which is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs. 

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and move on.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's more important to secure a deal that benefits me rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
