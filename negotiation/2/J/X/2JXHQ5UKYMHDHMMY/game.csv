"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $850000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $775000 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $775000 is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can consider a price of $825000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $795000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",795000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I can do $815000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
