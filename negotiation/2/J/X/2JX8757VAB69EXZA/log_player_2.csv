"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept the first offer. There's a chance Alice is willing to sell for less, and by rejecting, you start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear lower boundary.  If she rejects this, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but I want to see if she'll go lower. I'm willing to pay $135, but there's still some room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. I'm counter-offering with a price that's still below her last offer, but not too far off.  I want to show I'm serious about closing the deal but also see if she'll budge further.  If she rejects this, I'll be prepared to accept her last offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $2 above my last counteroffer. It's time to accept.  Further negotiation might get me an extra dollar or two, but the risk of losing the deal entirely isn't worth it.  I'm happy to save $18 compared to buying from John."
