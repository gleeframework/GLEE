Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

Since you have a safety net with John, you can aim high with Bob. The goal is to capture as much of the value difference ($1,500,000 - $1,200,000 = $300,000) as possible.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value.
* **Strong Price:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a still-attractive $100,000 gain compared to his valuation.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While a strong initial price, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial price.  You'll need to decide how much lower you're willing to go before accepting John's offer.
* **Relationship:** While maximizing profit is important, consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is valuable. A slightly lower price might be strategic in the long run."
