Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes you appear less desperate to sell.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if vague) can make it feel less arbitrary to Bob.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $175, we can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have gone higher. If he rejects, we can always fall back to our guaranteed sale with John. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still having a high chance of securing a sale."
