"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget, and you have ample room to negotiate. 
* It's highly likely Alice will be willing to go higher, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to her. 
* Buying from John right away would be a huge loss, as you could potentially get the product for much less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly higher than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm willing to negotiate. 
*  I'm aiming for a middle ground between Alice's offer and my maximum budget. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to accept this price, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has increased her offer, showing she is willing to negotiate.
*  The current price of $850,000 is a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than my maximum budget and still a fair price for Alice.
* Buying from John would cost me $650,000 more, making Alice's offer the better option."
