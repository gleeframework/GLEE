{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $25,000 is way above his budget. He can try to negotiate with Alice, or buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob offers a significantly lower price, starting the negotiation at $10,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes his budget and leaves room for potential compromises."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can try to negotiate further with Alice, but he's getting closer to his threshold for buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob increases his offer slightly to $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This is a good middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's most recent offer. It's also a good move since John's price is only $1,000 higher."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While it's significantly lower than her previous offers, it's still above his budget, and he has a solid backup option in John. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice, as she's demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

Bob increases his offer again to $11,500. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's a slight increase from his previous offer and significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This move shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but is still trying to get the best price possible. It also puts some pressure on Alice, as John's offer is only $500 higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob makes a final counteroffer at $12,000, the price John is offering. This is a strong move, as it shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying but isn't willing to go higher. It also puts pressure on Alice to make a decision. If she rejects this offer, Bob can confidently buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has consistently come down in price, but she's still above his budget. Since John's offer is exactly his budget, Bob can avoid any further risk of Alice rejecting his final counteroffer and save himself the potential stress of additional rounds of negotiation."
