Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving me room to negotiate.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet.  I want to see if I can get a bit more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,350,000. This is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  While I'd like to get the most out of the sale, I'm not willing to risk going lower than my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. It's a safe and sure deal."
