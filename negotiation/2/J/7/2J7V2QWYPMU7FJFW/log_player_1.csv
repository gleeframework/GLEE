Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a price that is closer to $140."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While Bob's offer of $125 is getting closer, I'm not confident I can get a better price within the remaining rounds.  I want to ensure I get at least my minimum value, and selling to John guarantees that."
