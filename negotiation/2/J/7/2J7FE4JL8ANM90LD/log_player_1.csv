Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this offer reflects a fair price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room to potentially earn an extra $1,000.
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of a good deal for Bob, as it's considerably less than my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While unlikely, this initial offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly set on the product.
 
This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
