Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob at $1,400,000 is still a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity for Bob. It's a price point significantly lower than your guaranteed sale to John but considerably higher than Bob's perceived value. This encourages him to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer."
