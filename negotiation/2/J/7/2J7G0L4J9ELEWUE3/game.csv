"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to me around $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the $8,000 price doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $18,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
