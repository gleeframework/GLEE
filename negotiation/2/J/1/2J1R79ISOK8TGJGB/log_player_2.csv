"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know it's worth at least $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fantastic price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal for Alice, Bob can get the same product from John for $8,000, which is within his budget and saves him $2,000."
