{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that I'm sure you'll find very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:**  This is a starting point that's higher than the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price gives me a better chance of earning more than my minimum value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  Bob's response will give me an idea of his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Secure a Deal Quickly:** If Bob accepts, I secure a quick sale. 
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can either counteroffer or move on to John, ensuring I don't lose out on a sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim to bridge the gap between our current positions, but I won't accept anything below my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. 
* **Message:** The message is firm but polite, indicating that I'm open to negotiation but have a clear price point in mind.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  By lowering my price, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain Value:** The price is still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Encourage Negotiation:** The message encourages Bob to reconsider his offer and move closer to my price. 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to assess the situation carefully:

* If Bob seems genuinely interested but still needs a lower price, I may need to reconsider my minimum value.
* If Bob is unlikely to budge, I'll consider selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still below that threshold.  Accepting his offer would mean selling the product for less than its worth to me.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, potentially offering $825,000. If Bob rejects again, I will seriously consider selling to John for $800,000."
