You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you have room to bargain."

While $12,750 is closer to your desired price, you can still get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
