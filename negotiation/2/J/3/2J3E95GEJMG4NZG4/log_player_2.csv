# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $14,000, so it's worth rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the value of this product to you is significant. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?

While $13,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal price point.  You can likely get it lower by continuing the negotiation."
