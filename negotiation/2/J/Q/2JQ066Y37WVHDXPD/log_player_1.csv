"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $120, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $100 is closer, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $95 is still below it. I'm confident I can get Bob to go higher.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm coming down to $98, which is only $2 away from my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about selling, but I'm still holding firm on my price. I'm aiming to close the deal this round."
