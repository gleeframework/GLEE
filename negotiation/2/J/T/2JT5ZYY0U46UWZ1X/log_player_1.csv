"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing negotiations with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming closer.  While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need the price to be lower to make this work. Would you consider $880,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I am still aiming for a higher price than $880,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a slightly better deal.  The negotiation is progressing, and I want to keep trying to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $895,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 895000}
