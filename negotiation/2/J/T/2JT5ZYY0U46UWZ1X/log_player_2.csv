"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $895,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $890,000 and we are running out of rounds to negotiate.  This price gets us the product well under budget and avoids the risk of having to go with John."
