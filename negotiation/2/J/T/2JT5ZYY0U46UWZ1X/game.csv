"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $850,000? That's a fair deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming closer.  While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I need the price to be lower to make this work. Would you consider $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still too low. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $895,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal.",895000.0,Alice,5,
