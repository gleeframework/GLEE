"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a much lower price. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  It's clear you recognize its value, so let's find a price point that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to be realistic.  While the product is good, $1,900,000 is still far too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000 to show I'm serious, but that's my limit for this round.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I've been reflecting on this product's potential, and I have to be honest, selling it for anything less than $1,700,000 would mean missing out on significant opportunities. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see where you're coming from, but that price is still a bit rich for me.  Let's try this – how about $1,100,000?  That's a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it reflects the value of the product while keeping things reasonable for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $1,100,000 is a significant jump and shows you're serious. To be completely transparent, I've had another offer for $1,500,000, but I value the potential of this partnership with you. Let's close this deal – how about we settle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the transparency.  It seems like we're getting closer.  While $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $1,250,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
