Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can work something out.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. $10,000 is too low for me, but I want to see if we can come to a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  It's a fair price that gives us both something to gain. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $10,500 is closer to what I want, I'm still not willing to go that low yet. I believe I can get a better price, and I want to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about we settle on $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
