Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.
