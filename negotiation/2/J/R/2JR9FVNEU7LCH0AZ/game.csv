"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 was a bit high, but I believe the product is worth more than $13,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $14,500.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $13,000. It's my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,7,
