"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $95? I'm hoping we can make a deal work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $120. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $107.50 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $115 as a final offer.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,7,
