"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000. It's in his best interest to negotiate with Alice or go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to make a worthwhile deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can still get the product from John for $10,000, so it's worthwhile to keep negotiating with Alice or go with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,500.  This allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice when a better deal is readily available."
