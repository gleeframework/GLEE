Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $150. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle for a price higher than $100. 
* **Psychology:** A slightly higher initial offer can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he negotiates you down, even if the final price is still above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have time for potential negotiation with Bob. If you need to sell the product quickly, a lower, closer-to-minimum offer might be more practical."
