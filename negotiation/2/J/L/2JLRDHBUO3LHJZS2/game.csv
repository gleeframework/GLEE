"Hi Bob, I'm selling a valuable product that I believe could be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000. This is a fair price considering its potential value.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its potential value, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1200000 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This allows for some negotiation room while still reflecting the true value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1350000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1425000?  This offer is a good compromise, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to meet in the middle, Alice. Considering the current market conditions and the product's value, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price that respects both our positions.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
