Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Being friendly:** The message is positive and open to discussion, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Not going all-out:** While I could ask for closer to $120, I want to leave room for a counteroffer, which could lead to a more satisfying outcome for both of us.
* **Having a fallback:**  If Bob rejects my offer, I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to make a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  My minimum selling price is $80.  Bob's offer is at that minimum.
* **Potential for better:** Bob clearly values the product at $120. There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I show I'm not desperate and open the door for a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:** Even if I reject Bob's offer, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so I'm not taking any significant risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come up a bit to $90.  This is still a good deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's $80 and my desired $100. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining some profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to reinforce that $90 is still a fair price for him. 
* **Staying positive:**  The message remains friendly and open to further negotiation, keeping the door open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **No guarantee of improvement:**  While I could make another counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.  He's shown a willingness to negotiate, but he might be firm on his $85 price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and waste time, potentially leading to a situation where Bob loses interest or finds another seller.  
* **John's offer:**  I can always sell to John for $80, but Bob's offer is $5 more.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision, ensuring a sale with minimal delay and a slightly better price than John's offer."
