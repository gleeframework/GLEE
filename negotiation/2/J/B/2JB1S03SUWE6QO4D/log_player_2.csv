"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's essential to negotiate to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is above my budget. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This signals his serious intent to negotiate and shows he's willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Justify the Offer:** Bob provides a reason for his counteroffer (""value to me"") to make it less arbitrary and encourage further discussion. 
* **Openness to Compromise:** The message ends on a positive note, indicating a willingness to work towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1000000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to his target.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer again and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $850,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  Let's reach an agreement and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob's counteroffer is now significantly closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a justification for his counteroffer, emphasizing fairness and a desire to close the deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone,  encouraging Alice to see the value in reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $950000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  He's in a strong position as he has the option to buy from John.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to his target or even close the deal at $800,000 with John.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to reach your target price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. To finalize this deal, I'm offering my final price of $875,000. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob makes this his final offer, signaling a strong desire to close the deal but also that he's prepared to walk away.
* **Compromise:**  He offers a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and his previous offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:**  The message focuses on the benefits of closing the deal for both parties, encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal, but I need to get closer to my target. Can we meet at $925000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  With only three rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  Bob has already offered a ""final price"" and seen it rejected.  It's unlikely Alice will come down significantly further, and it's not worth risking further rounds with only a small chance of getting a better price.

By choosing to buy from John, Bob guarantees a deal within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice."
