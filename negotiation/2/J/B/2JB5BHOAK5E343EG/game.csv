"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1300000. This still represents a great value for you and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $1250000 still isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1275000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
