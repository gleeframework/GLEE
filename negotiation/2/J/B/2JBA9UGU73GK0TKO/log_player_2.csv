"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! It's a high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

 Alice's starting price is too high. I can definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! That price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly. It's important to start with a lower offer to leave room for negotiation and still potentially secure a price well below my $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price I'm fully happy with.  It's worth another counter-offer to see if we can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $95?  That's a price I'm comfortable with."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

This counter-offer splits the difference between our last offers. It shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting a price reduction that's worthwhile for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in talks, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $98, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This product is worth a lot to me, and I want to make sure I get a fair price for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm, and $98 is a very good price â€“ only $2 more than my alternative. It's not worth the risk of her backing out completely for a tiny potential saving."
