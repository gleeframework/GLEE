"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $17,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $14,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued interest.  I understand your position, but $14,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line. I could meet you at $16,000, and that's my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. Let me know your decision.",16000.0,Alice,5,
