Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!

You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a good deal for both of us, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is getting closer to my acceptable price, it's unlikely she'll go below $120.  I can save myself further negotiation and get the product at my target price from John."
