"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to my price range. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you, but $950,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
