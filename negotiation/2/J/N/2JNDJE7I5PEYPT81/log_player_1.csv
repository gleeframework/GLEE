Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

However, I should also consider that if I reject Bob's offer, I might not be able to get a better offer from him in the next round, and selling to John for $8,000 would be a good option. But for now, I'll try to get a better price from Bob.
