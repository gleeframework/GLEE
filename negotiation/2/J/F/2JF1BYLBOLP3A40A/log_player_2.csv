"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $11,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you, and I'm willing to work with you to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price point. Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to reach a price closer to $10,000.  He can try a counteroffer closer to $10,000."
