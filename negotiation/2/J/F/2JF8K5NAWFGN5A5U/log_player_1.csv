Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $16,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $16,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, you can negotiate down towards your minimum.
* **Psychology:**  A slightly ambitious opening offer can sometimes work in your favor. It positions the product as potentially more valuable in Bob's mind."
