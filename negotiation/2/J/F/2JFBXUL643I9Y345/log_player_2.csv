"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from the value it holds for me, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you.  Let me know your thoughts.  If this doesn't work out, I'm confident I can secure a sale with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get a better deal from John at $1,200,000.  There's no need to settle for a higher price when you have a guaranteed lower option."
