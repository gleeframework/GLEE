"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment. I'm offering it to you at a price of $16,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full $15,000.",16000.0,Alice,1,
