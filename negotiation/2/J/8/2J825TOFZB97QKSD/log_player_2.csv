Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $105, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $115. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point. Accepting at $115 gets me the product at a significant savings compared to John's offer."
