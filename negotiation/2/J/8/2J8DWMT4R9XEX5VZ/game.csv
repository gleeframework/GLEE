"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand this product represents significant value, however, I have to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to settle at $700,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us, I believe.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
