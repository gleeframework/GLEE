Alice's offer:

Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000 and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price."
