Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is negotiating, the price is still significantly higher than what John offers. Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to a price lower than $1,150,000, but it's unlikely to go below John's $1,000,000 offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the best deal."
