"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500 right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9000?  It's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to make some concessions, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, $9000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $10000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",10000.0,Alice,5,
