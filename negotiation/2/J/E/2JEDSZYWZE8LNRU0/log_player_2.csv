"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500 right now. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You have 7 more rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to make some concessions, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, $9000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll compromise at $10000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  Although you have 5 rounds left to negotiate, it's unlikely Alice will drop her price further to a point you're comfortable with. It's more advantageous to buy from John at $8,000 and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
