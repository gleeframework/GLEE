"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower to meet you halfway, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $8,500.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8500.0,Alice,5,
