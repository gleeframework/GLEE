``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage a good relationship.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and whether or not I think a better deal can be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I need to hold out for a better price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too far below what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider fair. I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
