"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strong opening that leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum of $8,000 but also within the realm of possibility for a buyer who sees the product's potential value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to hold out for a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm countering with $9,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering $8,500, which is closer to my minimum price but still allows for some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that my minimum price is not negotiable and come closer to meeting me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is consistently offering below my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, I risk running out of time.  John's offer of $8,000 guarantees a safe and acceptable profit.  I'll sell to John to secure the deal."
