"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your willingness to deal. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $92.50. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to go up a bit from my previous offer â€“ how about $87.50?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $91.25. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",91.25,Alice,5,
