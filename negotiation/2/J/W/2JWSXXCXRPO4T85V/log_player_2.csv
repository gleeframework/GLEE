"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price ($120).**  You want to save as much money as possible.
* **You have leverage:** You can counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer is your safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy the product for $120."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your willingness to deal. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $92.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price ($120).**  You're trying to save as much money as possible.
* **You have leverage:** You've already shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice is clearly flexible.
* **John's offer is your safety net:** If negotiations with Alice fail, you can still buy the product for $120. 

You can likely get Alice to come down further with another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to go up a bit from my previous offer â€“ how about $87.50?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 87.5}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $87.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $91.25. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum price ($120).**  While you've made progress in negotiation, you're getting close to your limit, and there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.
* **You have a better alternative:**  John is willing to sell you the product for $120, which is still within your budget.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that if you continue negotiating, Alice might not budge, and you'll end up paying more than $120.  It's better to secure the product at John's price and avoid further negotiation risk."
