Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would significantly benefit you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to sell it for even more to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $12,000 creates a substantial perceived value for Bob. It's considerably less than our minimum but still a significant profit above his perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning a public listing, we subtly introduce a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.

This approach balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible sale while acknowledging the backup offer from John."
