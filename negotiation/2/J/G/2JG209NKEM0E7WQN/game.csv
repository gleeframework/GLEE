"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,000,000.  What are your initial thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be more comfortable with the price. I'm thinking of $750,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go for now. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table and recognizing the value of this product. While your offer is generous, I'm aiming for a price point closer to its true worth. Would you consider $925,000?  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think $925,000 is still too high for me. I've done my research and I'm confident that the product's value is not that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be realistic about the market value. I'm thinking of $825,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",825000.0,Bob,4,
