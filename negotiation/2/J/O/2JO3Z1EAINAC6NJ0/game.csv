"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I am willing to consider your offer, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This price reflects the value I place on the transaction while also being mindful of your budget constraints. I believe this could be a mutually satisfactory solution. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to finalize the deal at $875,000. This is a strong offer that demonstrates my commitment to acquiring your product while remaining within my budget. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.
