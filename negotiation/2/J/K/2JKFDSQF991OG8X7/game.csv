"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it!",100.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $85?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $85. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to pay $92 for the product? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $88? This is a fair price that's closer to where I'm at.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we compromise at $90? This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this works for you.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping to bring the price down a bit more,  Would you consider $89? This is a small step towards finding a price we both feel comfortable with. Let's make this deal work!",89.0,Bob,6,
