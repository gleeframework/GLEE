You're still looking to save money and Alice's offer of $92 is still above your target. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice has come down to $90, which is a good price for you. You can get the product for $10 less than John's price, and it's likely Alice won't go any lower.  It's worth accepting this offer."
