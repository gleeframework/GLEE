"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, $10,000. This is based on the assumption that Bob is likely to be interested in the product if he's engaging in the negotiation. It's also important to start high and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $8,500, I'm aiming for a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. While I'd still like to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good deal.  It's only $500 less than my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a good price now than to risk getting a lower price later."
