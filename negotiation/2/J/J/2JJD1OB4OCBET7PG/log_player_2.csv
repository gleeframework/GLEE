"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $13,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product. That's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's counteroffer of $12,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
*  While $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $12,000. 
* It is more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and save the additional $500."
