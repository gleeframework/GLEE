"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it for $1,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of what you'll be getting.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price given its potential value to me. I'm open to further negotiation, but I won't be able to go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, the product's worth to me is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",900000.0,Bob,4,
