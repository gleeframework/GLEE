"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this price very competitive. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.
