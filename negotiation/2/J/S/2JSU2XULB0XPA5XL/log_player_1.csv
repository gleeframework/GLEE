Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid a Lowball:** Offering a price too close to John's offer ($12,000) might make Bob feel like he can lowball you or that the product isn't as valuable as he initially thought."
