,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the market value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which reflects the value of the product and my ability to pay.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
