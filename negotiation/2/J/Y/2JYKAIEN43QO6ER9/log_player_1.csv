Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I will reject Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still well below my minimum desired value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of achieving a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This price should be more acceptable to you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired value, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to see if Bob is open to a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $950,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. This price should be more acceptable to you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  While I'm not thrilled with the negotiation with Bob stalling, I'm running out of rounds and the risk of not reaching an acceptable deal with Bob is becoming too high.  John's offer guarantees me a fair price, allowing me to meet my minimum value requirement."
