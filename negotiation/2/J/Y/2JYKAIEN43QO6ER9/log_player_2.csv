Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000.  It's a premium item worth a great deal to me, but I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay, which is $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement and ensures that I can meet my minimum needs. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This price should be more acceptable to you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $900000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
