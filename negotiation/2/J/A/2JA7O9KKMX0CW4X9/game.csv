"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $950,000?  It's still a good price for you, considering the value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that price.  Would you consider $875,000? That's a significant move on my end.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $912,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",912500.0,Alice,5,
