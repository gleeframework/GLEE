Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, as this is a reasonable starting point that allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $120.  This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only my minimum acceptable price, it's better than selling to John for the same amount.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the future."
