Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
