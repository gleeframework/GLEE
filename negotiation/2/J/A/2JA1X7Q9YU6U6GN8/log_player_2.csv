"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is better than $15,000, it's still above his target of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his target price of $12,000 as possible.  A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing Alice that he's serious about purchasing but also wants a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob.  While he could continue negotiating, he knows he can get the product for his target price of $12,000 from John.  There's no need to risk further negotiation when he has a guaranteed deal available."
