Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, the product is truly unique and its potential value for your business is significant. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to benefit from the deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice has come down to her minimum price, which is the same price John is offering. There's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice."
