"Alice, that initial offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be priced much lower to make sense for me. How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. This price still gives you a great value, and we can finalize this quickly. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for moving closer to a reasonable price.  However, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $950,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop the price to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay. Let's make it happen!",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 as a final compromise.  This is a significant price drop from my previous offer, and it shows how committed I am to making this deal work.  Let's reach an agreement and close this quickly. ",1200000.0,Alice,7,
