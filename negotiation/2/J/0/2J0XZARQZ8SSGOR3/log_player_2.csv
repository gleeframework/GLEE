"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it at $120. You can get the product from John for the same price. Therefore, it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer. You should reject it and buy the product from John."
