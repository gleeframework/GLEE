While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not getting what I want. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to inch closer to my goal."

Bob's offer is getting closer but I've already been through 5 rounds and I'm running out of time. I'm confident I can get my asking price from John, so I'm going to sell to him."
