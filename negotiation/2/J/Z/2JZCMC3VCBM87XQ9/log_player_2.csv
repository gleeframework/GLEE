"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his budget, and it makes more sense to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

Bob offers the minimum he's willing to pay, knowing it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save even more money. There's no reason to rush into an agreement when he has other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

Bob offers $13,000, a reasonable compromise between his initial offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows he's willing to negotiate but still maintains a strong position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. He can still try to negotiate a lower price. While $14,000 is close to his budget, he is still $2,000 over his preferred price. There are more rounds available and he has the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

Bob offers $13,500, a slightly higher price than his previous offer, showing he's willing to compromise but still aims to secure a good deal. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward while staying within his budget."
