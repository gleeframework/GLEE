Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A higher starting point gives me more leverage in the negotiation.
* **Account for John's offer:** While $1,750,000 is less than John's offer, it still provides a significant profit margin for me.  
* **Test Bob's interest:** This offer will immediately tell me if Bob is seriously interested in buying or if he's just testing the waters.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he accepts, I've secured a profitable sale. If the negotiation stalls, I'll always have the option to switch to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $800,000.  While it's tempting to take the quick sale, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and leaves a significant profit margin on the table.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:**  My floor for this product is $1,500,000. Selling for $800,000 would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation. I can now present a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:** I still have the safety net of John's offer, providing me with a guaranteed $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and present a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer but lower than my initial offer. My goal is to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $1,750,000 but still well above Bob's initial offer of $800,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding middle ground:**  This offer aims to find a middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Maintaining profit margin:** This price still provides me with a considerable profit margin, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Testing Bob's flexibility:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. If he's serious about buying, he may be willing to negotiate closer to this price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or switch to John's guaranteed offer. If he accepts, we'll have reached a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $900,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make the sale worthwhile.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum acceptable price:** My floor for this product is $1,500,000. Selling for $900,000 would still be a considerable loss for me.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, so there's no need to settle for less.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation. I can now present a counteroffer that is more aligned with my minimum acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and present a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'm not sure if Bob will accept it, I want to explore all options before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,300,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer of $1,200,000 but still significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,750,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the middle ground:** This offer is closer to Bob's latest offer of $900,000, signaling my willingness to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining profit margin:**  It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, allowing me to make a decent profit.
* **Testing Bob's limit:** This counteroffer will gauge how close Bob is to my desired price point. If he rejects, it might be time to consider John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully weigh the benefits of continuing negotiations with the risk of losing out on the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. If he accepts, we've reached a compromise that benefits both of us."
