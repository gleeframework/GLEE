{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob allows for maximizing profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, there's a potential margin to negotiate within.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading to selling at the base price to John. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price with Bob justifies the risk."
