I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a higher price from Bob. I believe this is a reasonable starting point given the unknown value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'm open to negotiating, his offer is well below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and avoid having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want it to be. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise, but still gives me a decent profit margin. I'm hoping this is appealing enough to Bob, as he's clearly willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my desired profit margin.  At this point, I'm willing to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
