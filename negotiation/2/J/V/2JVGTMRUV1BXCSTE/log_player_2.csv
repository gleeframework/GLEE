I'm still not comfortable with $14,000. It's closer to my budget, but I'm still going to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm going to go ahead and buy the product from John for $10,000. It's a better deal overall for me, even if it doesn't involve any more negotiation."
