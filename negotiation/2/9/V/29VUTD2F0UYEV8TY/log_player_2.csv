**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to our desired price point, but we're still above our $80 maximum. We have room to negotiate further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Okay Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I can do $80, and I think that's a really fair offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now at the point where we should hold firm at our $80 maximum. Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate downwards, so this is a good test to see if she'll accept our ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to get a bit closer to my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $82, and I think that's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $82. We've reached the point where it's better to take the guaranteed deal from John at $80 rather than risk Alice not budging further."
