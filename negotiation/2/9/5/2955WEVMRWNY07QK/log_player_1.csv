"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This is a common tactic to set a strong starting point and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product, making it seem more attractive to Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to reach a price somewhere between $1,000,000 (my minimum) and $800,000 (Bob's maximum).  By starting high, I can create room to make concessions and still secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  There's room for further negotiation.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and try to get closer to my goal of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness & Value:** I'm framing the counter-offer as a ""fair price"" for both of us, emphasizing the value Bob would be getting.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Strategy:**

This counter-offer aims to bridge the gap between our positions. It gives Bob room to negotiate further while ensuring I stay above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired target. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and $950,000 is certainly a fair price. However, this product is truly unique and has the potential for significant value for you. To bridge the gap and seal the deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $975,000. This is a final concession on my end, as it's very close to my minimum price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm positioning this offer as my final concession, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but $975000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  There's only a $75,000 gap between his offer and my minimum, and with a few more rounds, I think I can get him closer to my desired price.  

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm aware that I'm running out of rounds, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I really want to make this deal work. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the offer to both parties, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding urgency by suggesting finalizing the deal now.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm aiming to strike a balance between securing a price that's as close to my minimum as possible while leaving some room for negotiation. This counter-offer is a slight concession, but it still positions me favorably in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm starting to lose interest in the product if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm close to reaching my goal, I'm running out of time.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John just to potentially get a slightly better deal with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my desired price, it's important to secure a deal when there's a guaranteed alternative available. I don't want to risk losing both buyers and ending up with no sale at all."
