"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and a great deal for you considering the value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $950000 is certainly a fair price. However, this product is truly unique and has the potential for significant value for you. To bridge the gap and seal the deal, I'm willing to offer it to you for $975000. This is a final concession on my end, as it's very close to my minimum price.  Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $975000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $925000 for the product, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I really want to make this deal work. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $950000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. If you're serious about getting this product, let's finalize this now.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I'm starting to lose interest in the product if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price.",920000.0,Bob,8,
