**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is for $15,000, which is your maximum budget. You are indifferent between buying from Alice and buying from John. Since you are trying to save money, you should choose the option that gives you the best chance to get a lower price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller who might be willing to sell for less."
