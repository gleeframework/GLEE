""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you and your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open it up to other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit lower, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers adds a touch of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob if he's willing to pay a premium. This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
