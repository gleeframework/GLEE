Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $12,500 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $14,000. How about $13,500?  This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good compromise and within the range I'm comfortable with.  I'd rather secure the sale than risk another rejection and potentially be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
