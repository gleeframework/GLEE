Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $8,500 is still too low for me, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a bit more than that to make this deal work. How about $9,500? It's still a good price for you, and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is a reasonable compromise.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of him walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower profit than I could get now."
