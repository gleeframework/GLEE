Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,800,000 is quite high.  I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I could consider coming down to $1,500,000. This is a very competitive offer for something of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,500,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Perhaps we could agree on $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still negotiate a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I can't justify anything more than that.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob has reached my minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from him, so it's best to accept now."
