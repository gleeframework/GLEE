"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $80 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $140 for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unwilling to go below $110.  While she might come down a little more, it's unlikely she'll reach our target price of $80.  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which meets our needs.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
