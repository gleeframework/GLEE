Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
