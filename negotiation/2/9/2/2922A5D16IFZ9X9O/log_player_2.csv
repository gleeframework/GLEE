"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it? Let me know! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your value:** The product is worth $120 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** $100
* **John's price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee you'll succeed, and it might risk losing the deal altogether."
