Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $20,000, I can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, great! If he hesitates or tries to negotiate, it shows he's interested but wants a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to be a bit bolder with my initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price."
