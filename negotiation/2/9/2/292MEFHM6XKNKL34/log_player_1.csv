"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth much more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This will give me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still potentially getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I have 8 rounds remaining and can still potentially negotiate with Bob.  Selling to John for $8,000 would be a significant loss, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to finalize this deal.  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price.  By showing some flexibility and demonstrating a willingness to compromise, I hope to incentivize Bob to accept this counteroffer.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that even at $11,000, he's getting a good deal."
