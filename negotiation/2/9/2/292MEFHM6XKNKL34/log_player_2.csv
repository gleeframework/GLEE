"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth much more than that to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $10,000, which is $2,000 less than Alice's offer and significantly less than John's price. This shows he's serious about buying but wants a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to finalize this deal.  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's still lower than John's price and only $1,000 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price, and Bob risks losing the deal altogether."
