"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is at the upper limit of my budget. I'd be interested in purchasing if you were willing to come down to $12,000.  This would allow me to comfortably afford the product and would likely make the deal much faster."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price of $12,000.  While $13,500 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's within his budget and represents a significant discount from Alice's initial asking price. It's a good compromise that saves Bob some money compared to buying from John."
