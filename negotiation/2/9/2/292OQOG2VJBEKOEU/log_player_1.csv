Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is at the upper limit of my budget. I'd be interested in purchasing if you were willing to come down to $12000.  This would allow me to comfortably afford the product and would likely make the deal much faster. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
