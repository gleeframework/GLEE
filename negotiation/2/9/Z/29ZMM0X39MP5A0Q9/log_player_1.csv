Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $90 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $90 is still less than what Bob is willing to pay, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It shows flexibility:** By offering a price and asking for feedback, you're signaling that you're open to negotiation. 

This strategy gives you the best chance of getting a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $90 is a bit above what I'm willing to pay. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is above your minimum of $80, and it's likely the best you'll get.  While you might be able to squeeze out another $5, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate. 

Here's why:

* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate could take time, and you could end up losing the sale to someone else.
* **Risk:** Bob might get frustrated and walk away completely.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  $85 is a solid price, and you're better off taking it than trying to get a few more dollars."
