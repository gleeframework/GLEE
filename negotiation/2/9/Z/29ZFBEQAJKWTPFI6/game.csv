"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  How about $1,000,000? I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,025,000 is the best I can do right now. It's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $1,030,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
