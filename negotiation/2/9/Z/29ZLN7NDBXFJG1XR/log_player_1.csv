I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, knowing that I can always walk away and sell to John for that amount. This gives me the best chance of getting my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though it's a bit closer to what I want. I'm going to reject and counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering a price that's still below my minimum but shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.  This time, I'm only $500 away from Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made several concessions. At this point, it's clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that's satisfactory for me.  Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000."
