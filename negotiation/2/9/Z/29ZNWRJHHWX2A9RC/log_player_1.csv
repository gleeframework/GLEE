"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, aiming to leave some room for negotiation. Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm comfortable with pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I can sell to John for $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. It's still early in the negotiation, and there are 8 rounds left. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that's above the product's worth to Bob.  I'm hoping that by showing flexibility, I can encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is higher than what John is willing to pay.  It's also a good compromise, as it's closer to my target price than his previous offer. I'll accept his offer to secure the deal and get a good price for the product."
