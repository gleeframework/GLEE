"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to buy from Alice, especially with John as a backup option.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best way to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
``` 

Starting low is a good strategy to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  $4,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and hopefully will encourage her to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $5,500 is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point.  There are still rounds left, and I can likely negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but still holding firm on getting a good price.  $4,500 is a good compromise point, and hopefully, Alice will be more receptive to it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my desired price point. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product at a good price while also ensuring that I don't run the risk of losing the product to another buyer.  It's important to note that I have another 5 rounds to negotiate with Alice, so I might have been able to secure a better deal, but given the risk of losing the deal, I'm comfortable accepting this offer."
