"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product,  $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This gives you a good price, and it's still fair for me.  What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $825,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $775,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to meet in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm happy we're getting closer.  However,  $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $800,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the minimum I can accept.  If we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options. ",800000.0,Alice,5,
