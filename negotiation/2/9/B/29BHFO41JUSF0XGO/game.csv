"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room to negotiate further.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000. This would allow me to make a good investment, while still leaving some room for you to profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is a fair price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'll offer it to you for $1,090,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your willingness to invest, while still giving me a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
