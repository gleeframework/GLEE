"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  Alice's offer is far too high, and Bob can get the product for a much lower price from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice, but if that fails, Bob has a guaranteed alternative."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's lower than the initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate further, but he has a safe alternative if the negotiation fails."

I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's budget, even after several rounds of negotiation.  While continuing to negotiate might result in a better deal, there's no guarantee, and Bob has a safe and guaranteed alternative with John. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk continuing a negotiation that might not lead to a favorable outcome."
