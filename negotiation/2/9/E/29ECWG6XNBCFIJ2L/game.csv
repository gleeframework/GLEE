"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $8,000.  I'm willing to offer you $8,000 for it, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a significant step up from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both place on this product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
