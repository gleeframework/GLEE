"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a range that might be acceptable to him. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers, without immediately resorting to the fallback option of selling to John.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message can make Bob more receptive to the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and allows me to explore more options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Argument:** I'm justifying the price by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive and Collaborative:** My message maintains a friendly tone, focusing on finding a compromise for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer is only $500 below my ideal price of $13,500. 
* **Risk of losing out:** Further negotiation might result in a lower price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Time constraint:**  We are already in round 4, leaving fewer opportunities to reach a more favorable agreement.
* **Safe and secure:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale close to my minimum acceptable price, providing financial stability and security."
