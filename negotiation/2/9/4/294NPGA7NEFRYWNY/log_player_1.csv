Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.

We've been going back and forth for a while, and it doesn't seem like Bob is going to meet my minimum. It's getting too close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000."
