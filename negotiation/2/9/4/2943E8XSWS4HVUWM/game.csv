"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's valued at $800,000 and I believe it will be a great asset for you.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $850,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $790,000.",790000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $790,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to work with you.  What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
