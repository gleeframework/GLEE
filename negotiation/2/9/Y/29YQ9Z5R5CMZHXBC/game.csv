"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, we're still quite far apart on price. To be frank,  $800,000 is the highest I'm willing to go.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
