{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging to make him more likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find it within my budget of $100. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's at my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a little to $110.  This still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still above Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profit for me, and it avoids the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for a lower price."
