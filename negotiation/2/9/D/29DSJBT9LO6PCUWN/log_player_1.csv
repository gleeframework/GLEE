Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with another interested party."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards.
* **Sense of exclusivity and urgency:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and setting a deadline encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out on what he might perceive as a valuable deal.
* **Justification for price:** While not explicitly stating your minimum, hinting at the product's value to someone ""with your business acumen"" subtly justifies the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Determine your lowest acceptable price beforehand.  
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your starting price and tone to be less aggressive."
