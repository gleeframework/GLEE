"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the unique value of your product, $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $180 is getting closer, I'm still unfortunately not able to go that high.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $80. If you're not willing to come down that far, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you $160, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider selling to John. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Alice,5,
