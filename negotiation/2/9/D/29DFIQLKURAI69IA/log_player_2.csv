Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree that the product has value, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,500,000 for this product. Considering its true value, I believe this is more than fair.  Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her absolute minimum price is $1,500,000.  This is well above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you can accept.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs, making it the most logical choice at this point."
