"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price of $15,000,  $14,000 is a good deal.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
