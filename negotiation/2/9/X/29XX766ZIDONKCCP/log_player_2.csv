"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is still too high ($1,000,000) compared to your maximum budget ($1,200,000). 
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still leaves a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000 to reflect the product's full potential. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value we've discussed.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your ideal price point. You're aiming for a lower price.
* There's still room for negotiation, and you have more leverage than before, as Alice rejected your offer.
* A counteroffer will allow you to continue to attempt to lower the price."
