"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth where Bob can potentially secure a more favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is now within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. It's worth accepting this offer to save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and losing the deal is higher."
