"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low of a price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $120. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm still not able to go that high. I'm willing to offer $95, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $95. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering it to you for $110. I think this is a good compromise, considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again. While I'm interested in the product,  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $100, which I think is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,6,
