"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8250? I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get for this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. But $7500 is still below my minimum.  Let's be fair.  I'm willing to come down to $7800. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much.  What do you say?",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $7200?",7200.0,Bob,6,
