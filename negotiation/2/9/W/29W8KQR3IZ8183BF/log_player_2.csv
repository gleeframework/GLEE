# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value for you. I understand this product is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000, which is a significant discount. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000.  Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $1,250,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You can still save money:** Even though you value the product at $1,500,000, you're getting it for less than that. This allows you to save money.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to maximize savings."
