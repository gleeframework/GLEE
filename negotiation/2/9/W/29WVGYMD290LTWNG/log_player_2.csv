"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

The price Alice offered is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. It's likely Alice will reject this, but it signals my seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has now offered the maximum price I'm willing to pay.  While I'd prefer to get it for less, there's no guarantee of a better deal in future rounds. Accepting this offer means I secure the product at my limit and avoid the risk of losing it completely."
