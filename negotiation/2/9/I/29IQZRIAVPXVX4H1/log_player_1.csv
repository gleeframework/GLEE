Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you'll recognize its value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. I'm asking for $2,000,000.  Let me know your decision quickly, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher price ($2,000,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows Alice to secure a price significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive bargaining.
* **Backup Option:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of falling back on the guaranteed sale to John."
