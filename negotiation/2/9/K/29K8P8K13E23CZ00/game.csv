"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $1,350,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
