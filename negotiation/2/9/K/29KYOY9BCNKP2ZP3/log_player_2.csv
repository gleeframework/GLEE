"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $15,000 to you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm going to try to get her down a bit further before I consider accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is being stubborn, but she's come down to a price that's within my budget. I'd like to get it lower, but I've already rejected a few offers and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best choice to ensure I get the product while still saving some money."
