"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. This item is not just any product; it's an investment in excellence and efficiency. Given its high value to you, I understand its worth is $12,000 to you personally. Considering its significance and the benefits it offers, I propose a special introductory offer of $13,500. This price not only reflects the quality but also provides you with a significant saving compared to its market value. I believe this is a fair deal that maximizes value for both of us. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, her offer of $13,500 is still higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. You know John is offering the product for $12,000, which meets your budget exactly.  There's no point in paying more than you need to."
