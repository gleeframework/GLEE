"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal that works for both of us. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,000,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
