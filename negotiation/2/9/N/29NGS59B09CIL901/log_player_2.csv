"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He is looking to spend no more than $8,000, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your top offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above his maximum budget.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $8,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a compromise that takes into account your original offer and my original price. I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, it's still $1,500 over his maximum.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice down to $8,000.  He has five rounds left and can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering my previous offer and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to pay $8500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  While Alice has come down in price, $9,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. He's only got 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will come down to his preferred $8,000. Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product for his maximum price and avoids further negotiation."
