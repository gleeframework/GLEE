"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's serious about buying.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $1,000,000 is my ideal price, I'm open to negotiation. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling like I've instantly given away too much.
* **Setting a positive tone:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair deal, emphasizing the product's value. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  I'll be watching how Bob responds and adapting my strategy throughout the 10 rounds. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is the minimum:**  While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at this point.
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are 8 rounds left, and I have the advantage of being able to counteroffer.  I believe there's potential for a better price with more negotiation.
* **Selling to John:**  This is a good option to have in my back pocket, but I'm willing to risk it for now to see if I can get a higher price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to craft a counteroffer that's appealing enough to Bob to make him consider raising his offer, but not so low that I give away too much. I'll also need to consider how strongly Bob seems to want the product, as that will factor into my negotiation strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal happen. This reflects the value I've put into the product and offers you a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm genuinely interested in a deal.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product, but now mentioning the ""significant discount"" to make the offer more enticing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm still open to negotiation, but the price is closer to my minimum. This puts pressure on Bob to either come closer to my price or walk away.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to consider how much lower I'm willing to go in the next round. I'll also factor in his tone and any signs of his urgency to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $850,000 is getting very close to my minimum price of $800,000. However, I'm still holding out for a better deal.
* **John's offer is still available:**  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $800,000, so I have a safety net. This gives me the freedom to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  With 6 rounds left, I have time to explore whether Bob is willing to go higher. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll craft a counteroffer that's close to Bob's $850,000 offer, but still slightly higher. This will demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still keeping the pressure on Bob to raise his offer. I'll also continue to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a sense that we're both close to an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows us to both walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm demonstrating further flexibility by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's current offer.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and ""both walk away happy"" aspects to create a sense of win-win.
* **Pressure to close:**  I'm suggesting that we're close to a deal, which puts pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the opportunity.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll have to consider lowering my offer in the next round, but I'll also be ready to move on to John if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $825000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's offer:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 above John's offer of $800,000. It's tempting to accept, but there's still potential for a better deal.
* **Remaining rounds:** With four rounds left, I have time to see if Bob is willing to go higher.
* **Risk of losing to John:** While I'm willing to take the risk, I'm mindful that John is always a viable option.

**Next Steps:**

I will need to craft a counteroffer that is close to Bob's offer but still slightly higher.  I need to  keep the pressure on Bob to raise his offer but also be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $840,000, but this is my final offer.  If you're truly serious about this deal, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm setting a firm line to signal my seriousness.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm making a small compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a good price.
* **Emphasis on fair price:**  I'm reframing my offer as fair for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.

**Next Steps:**

This is my last chance to get a better deal from Bob. I'll be ready to move on to John if he rejects this offer, but I'll be watching his response closely to see if he's truly interested in closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to be realistic about the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $820000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two rounds left:** We are down to the last two rounds and Bob's offer has actually decreased from the last round.  There's not much room for him to raise his offer further.
* **John's offer is safe:**  It's better to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk another rejection from Bob and potentially be left with nothing.
* **Time is running out:**  Continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower price or no deal at all.  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing.

**Conclusion:**

Although I'd prefer to get more than $800,000, it's smarter to take the guaranteed deal with John. This ensures I make a profit and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
