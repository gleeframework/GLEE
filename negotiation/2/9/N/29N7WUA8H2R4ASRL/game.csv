,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $90 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in that.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, so I'll offer $85. Can you consider that?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again? I'm willing to go down to $87.50. This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $86.25. Can you consider that?",86.25,Bob,6,
