"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me. I think you'll really appreciate its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and her valuation. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below your $8,000 maximum.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help you understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she completely rejects it, you'll know you need to move closer to her price point. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $8,000 is always an option if negotiations with Alice don't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think you'll still get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but she's still above your ideal price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation.  You'll likely be able to get the price closer to $8,000 with another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This offer shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her price, but you're still seeking a significant discount.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $7,500 is a strong negotiating point. It's a reasonable compromise between your initial offer and her counteroffer, and it keeps you below your maximum budget. 
* **John's Offer:** Remember, you can always fall back on John's $8,000 offer if needed. However, there's a good chance Alice might accept $7,500 to avoid losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer you a price of $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is now only $500 away from John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Minimal Savings:** Even if you could negotiate Alice down a bit further, the savings would be minimal compared to John's offer. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield significant benefits and could drag out the process. 

It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing â€“ John's offer of $8,000."
