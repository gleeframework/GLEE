Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I want to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe this is still a fair price for the product, and it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,250,000 is a good compromise and a significant profit for me.  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to result in a lower price, and selling to John guarantees a lower price.  I'll take the profit and move on."
