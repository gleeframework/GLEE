This offer is a starting point. It allows for potential negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's value but below my own minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the potential for a good deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to make a deal,  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum. I will counter with a higher price, hoping to find a compromise."

This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I get a price closer to my desired range. I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price, hoping to find a middle ground."
