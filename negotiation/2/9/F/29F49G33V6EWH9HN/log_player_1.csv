{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The offer is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum.** This creates room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **The message is friendly and highlights the potential benefits for Bob.** This encourages him to engage in the negotiation.
* **I'm keeping the option of selling to John open.** This gives me leverage in case Bob becomes too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still below it.**  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John would be a better outcome right now, but I believe I can get a better price from Bob.** The risk of losing Bob entirely is worth the potential for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. I can come down to $950,000.  This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm meeting Bob halfway, but still maintaining a profit margin.** This shows I'm serious about making a deal while not giving away too much.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.** I want to keep him engaged and motivated to reach an agreement. 
* **I'm keeping my fallback option with John in mind.** If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $920000? I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price.**  The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal, and the risk of losing him altogether is high. 
* **Selling to John would be more profitable, but it would take longer and potentially involve more negotiation.**  This deal with Bob is a good outcome, especially considering the time and effort spent so far. 
* **It's important to balance profit with the potential for future business.**  By closing this deal, I might establish a good relationship with Bob and potentially open doors for future transactions."
