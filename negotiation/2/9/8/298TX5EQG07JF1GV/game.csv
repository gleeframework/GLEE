I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've already discounted the price from $150 to $120, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget at $115.  Let's split the difference and go with $110. That would be a fair deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than $115. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $112.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go.",112.5,Alice,5,
