"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth at least $100 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? This is still a great deal for you and gives me a fair price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'd be getting a good product and you'd be getting a sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $95 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer, but still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This gives you a good price and allows me to get a fair value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to reach an agreement at $95.  It would be a fair deal for both of us and let us both walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is getting repetitive, and he's not willing to budge much.  I've also already had several rounds with him, and I'm getting close to the limit.  Rather than risk another round of counter-offers and potential deadlock, I'll sell the product to John for $100. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum value and secures a sale without further hassle."
