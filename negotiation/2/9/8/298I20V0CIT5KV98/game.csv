"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? This is still a great deal for you and gives me a fair price.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'd be getting a good product and you'd be getting a sale.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is closer, but still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This gives you a good price and allows me to get a fair value for the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to reach an agreement at $95.  It would be a fair deal for both of us and let us both walk away happy.  What do you say?",95.0,Bob,6,
