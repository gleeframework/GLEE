"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $11,000. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $11,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I feel that's a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and then some. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll counteroffer at $10,500. This is my final concession, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand this is important to you, Alice, and I respect your position. How about we split the difference at $10,000?  This would close the gap and hopefully work for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $10,750. This is my last offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",10750.0,Alice,7,
