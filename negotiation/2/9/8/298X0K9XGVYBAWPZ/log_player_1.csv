Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special price of $180. I believe it offers great value and you'll be very happy with it."", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""special price"" and ""great value,"" I aim to subtly justify the higher price without revealing my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, I don't lose out.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable given his own valuation."
