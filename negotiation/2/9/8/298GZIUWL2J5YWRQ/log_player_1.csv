Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential worth to your business. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit, but stay realistic.
* **Understanding Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 provides leverage.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""fair offer,"" ""potential worth"") can make it more appealing.

By starting at $925,000, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above your guaranteed sale price."
