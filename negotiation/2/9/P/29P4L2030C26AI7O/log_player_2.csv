"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming to get the product for a price close to Alice's value ($100).  Starting with a lower counteroffer gives me room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Direct:**  I want to maintain a positive negotiation tone while being clear about my desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do better than $90, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a price I'd consider, but I still have room to negotiate. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $110 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land around $100. Would you be willing to go that low?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm being direct about my target price ($100), which aligns with Alice's value for the product.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While I'm aiming for $100, I'm open to a slight adjustment if Alice pushes back (e.g., $105). 
* **Limited Rounds:** I'm conscious that we have limited rounds, so I'm trying to reach a deal quickly while still negotiating a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I can do $105, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $105 is a very reasonable price, only $5 more than Alice's value and well below my $150 maximum.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for $100 might lead to Alice walking away or the deal timing out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings of getting the product for $100 instead of $105 aren't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
