,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $155. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $155 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $140, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's try to make this work!",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $140? That's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can both be happy with that deal.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $140, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. That's the best I can do.",142.5,Alice,7,
