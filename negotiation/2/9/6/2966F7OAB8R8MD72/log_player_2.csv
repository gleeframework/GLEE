"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$170 is too high for Bob, so it is better to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $155. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$155 is still too high for Bob. He's trying to save money, and $120 from John is still a better deal.  Let's see if we can get Alice closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $155 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to pay $140, which is closer to what I can afford. Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $145 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still higher than his target price of $120. He can still get the product from John for cheaper, so he'll reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $140? That's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can both be happy with that deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go back to $140, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $142.50. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been trying to get the price lower but Alice isn't budging much. It's getting closer to his target price of $120, but the offer is still a little too high.  Since he can get the product for his target price from John, it's a good time to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
