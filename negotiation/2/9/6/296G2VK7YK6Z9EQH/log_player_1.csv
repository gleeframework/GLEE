"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price and it's a good deal for both of us. It's also better than selling to John for $1,200,000, as I would have to pay a commission to John."
