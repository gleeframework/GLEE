"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for improvement. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within Bob's budget. This aggressive stance will force Alice to either accept a lower price or continue negotiations.  This approach aims to create a starting point for negotiation and see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,050,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay from John.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's previous offer, but it is now at Bob's maximum acceptable price. It leaves little room for further negotiations, putting the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
