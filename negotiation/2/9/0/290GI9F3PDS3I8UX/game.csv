"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 just isn't enough. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
