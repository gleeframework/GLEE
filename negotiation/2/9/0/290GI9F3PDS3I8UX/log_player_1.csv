This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. It also shows I'm willing to compromise, making Bob more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
