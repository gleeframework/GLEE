Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and increases the chance of securing a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($8,000).
* **Setting a High Anchor:** By initially offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, you anchor the negotiation higher. This might make him more amenable to a price slightly lower than $12,000, but still higher than your minimum acceptable price ($10,000).
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's a safety net if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with potential negotiation and potentially adjusting your price downwards."
