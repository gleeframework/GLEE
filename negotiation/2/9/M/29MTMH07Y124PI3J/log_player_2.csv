"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality product, and I believe it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's crucial to start the negotiation by rejecting this offer and showing Alice that you're serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high for Bob's budget. While it's a compromise, Bob should continue negotiating for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will allow Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still above what I can afford. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $9,000? This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair price considering the current market."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a small increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's closer to Bob's target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get the price down even further.  Bob should be mindful of the remaining rounds and consider the potential of buying from John if a deal with Alice isn't possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $9,800 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm confident we can reach a final agreement if we both compromise a little more. Let's try $9,500.  I'm sure this price will be mutually beneficial and allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is getting close to what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,700 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. With only a few rounds remaining, the chances of getting Alice to go lower are slim. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and gets a better deal."
