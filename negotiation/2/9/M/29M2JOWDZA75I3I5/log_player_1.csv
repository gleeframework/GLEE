"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm implying the product is valuable without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value ($150). This avoids giving him too much information."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than $80 (selling to John), I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a higher price, and I believe I have room to negotiate. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial price. How about $105? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reduced price:** I'm counteroffering with $105, which is closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:** I'm still being friendly and trying to build rapport.
* **Highlighting value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about splitting the difference and doing $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $97 is very close to my initial goal of getting a price closer to $100.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll keep lowering his offer or I might not be able to reach a deal. It's better to accept this offer and close the deal."
