"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$850,000 is a good price, but there's room to negotiate.  Since I have 10 rounds, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down. It's a strong opening position, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still higher than my initial counteroffer of $700,000.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'll try to push for a lower price by sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good deal. By incrementally increasing my offer, I hope to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $735,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance the next round will be a counteroffer that's closer to her initial price.  Accepting this offer saves time and ensures I get a good price."
