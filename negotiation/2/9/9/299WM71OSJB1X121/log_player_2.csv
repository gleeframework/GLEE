"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to see if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. It doesn't reflect the true market value and potential returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider $1,350,000. This price demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm prepared to buy from John if I can't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm hopeful we can reach a deal in this round."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our discussions and believe we can still make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and she's said it's her final offer.  While there's a chance I could get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, it's risky.  John is offering a guaranteed price that's within my budget, so it's the safer option at this point.  It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and move on."
