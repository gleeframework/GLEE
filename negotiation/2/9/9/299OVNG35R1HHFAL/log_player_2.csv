"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price. There's room for negotiation to save money. Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that allows me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while accommodating your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,150,000.  This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than the $1,200,000 he would pay John. While there's still room for negotiation, the risk of a further counteroffer leading to a higher price than $1,150,000 is present.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the best choice to save money."
