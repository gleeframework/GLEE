"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum price and Bob's perceived value.  I want to see if he'll accept it right away, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer.  How about $130?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm sticking with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I want to stay above $120 for now, as it's still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. How about $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $125 is a good price, and it's getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to haggle, especially since I can still make a profit."
