"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to be flexible.

This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
