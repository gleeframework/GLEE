"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1800000.  This price reflects the unique value and potential it holds. I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value you mentioned earlier. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the value and potential I see in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This offer still allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment, while hopefully still being attractive to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1500000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also being a good deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
