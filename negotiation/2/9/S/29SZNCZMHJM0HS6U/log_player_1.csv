Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  I'm asking for $1,400,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering a price slightly below John's offer creates a strong incentive for Bob to accept.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle on a price higher than our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.  

This strategy prioritizes securing the highest possible sale price from Bob while retaining the safety net of John's offer."
