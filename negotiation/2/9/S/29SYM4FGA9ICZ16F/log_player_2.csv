"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is a better price than John's $1,000,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and offers a fair profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This price takes into account your willingness to compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and Bob ending up paying $1,000,000 to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
