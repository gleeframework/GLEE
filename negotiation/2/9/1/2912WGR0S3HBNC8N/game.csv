"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $7,000?  I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - how about $7,750? That's a significant step from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about finding a compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
