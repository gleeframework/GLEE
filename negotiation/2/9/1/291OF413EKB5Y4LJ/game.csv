"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. To move forward, I can offer the product for $1,100,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me, but we're not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to the mark. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept $1,000,000. My final offer is $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount from my original asking price and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I believe my offer of $1,000,000 is just that. It respects the value of the product while working within my budget. Honestly, I'm getting close to exploring other options if we can't find an agreement here.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
