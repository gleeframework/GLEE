"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This is a common strategy in negotiation to leave room for bargaining.  I'm also trying to create a positive rapport by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is a decent offer and better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for less than $8,500 just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,200 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,200, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,200, which would be $8,100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,100 is very close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to close the deal for that amount. I'm also aware that I have limited time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
