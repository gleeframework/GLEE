"I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,200 is the lowest I can go. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,200, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,200, which would be $8,100. Can you consider that?",8100.0,Bob,4,
