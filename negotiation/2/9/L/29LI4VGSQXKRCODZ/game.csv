,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,625.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase.",10625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $10,625 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,687.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product.",10687.5,Alice,5,
