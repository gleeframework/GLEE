Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not desperate to sell right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better middle ground. Would $8750 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer as it's a decent gain and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing further."
