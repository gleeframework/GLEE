"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. Would you consider purchasing the product for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $105.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. To move forward, I would like to propose an offer of $115 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer, aiming for a mutual agreement that respects both our valuations.",115.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $112 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",108.0,Bob,6,
