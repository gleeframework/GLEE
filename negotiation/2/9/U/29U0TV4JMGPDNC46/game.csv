"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted. It's not just an item; it's a statement of quality and excellence. Given its exceptional value and craftsmanship, we believe it's worth more than $100, but considering your appreciation for its worth, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you. I propose we agree on a fair price that reflects its true value to both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price that could potentially be higher than what you initially expected? Remember, this is your chance to own something truly special at a price that could be more favorable than any other offer out there.",125.0,Alice,1,
