"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted. It's not just an item; it's a statement of quality and excellence. Given its exceptional value and craftsmanship, we believe it's worth more than $100, but considering your appreciation for its worth, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to you. I propose we agree on a fair price that reflects its true value to both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a price that could potentially be higher than what you initially expected? Remember, this is your chance to own something truly special at a price that could be more favorable than any other offer out there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's sales pitch is compelling, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy it at your desired price point."
