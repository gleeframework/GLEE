"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. I'll counter with $12500.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and go up to $11500. Can you meet me there?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11500. I'll counter with $13000, which is a bit above my previous offer, but still a good compromise.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $12200, but I'll throw in a premium service package that's worth $800. So, the total price would be $13000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the premium service package, but I'm still not comfortable with the total price of $13000. I'm willing to go up to $12200, but I need to stick to my budget. Can you reconsider the price without the premium package?",12200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'll make one more serious offer, but this time, I'll remove the premium service package and just focus on the product itself. I'll sell it to you for $12500, which is a fair price considering the product's value. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",12500.0,Alice,9,
