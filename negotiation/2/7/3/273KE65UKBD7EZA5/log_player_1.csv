Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price given the value it brings me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this now.
