"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low for me. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000? It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is closer than his previous offer, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $775,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a reasonable offer considering the market value and our negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer,  $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $750,000 at this point, and I'm confident I can get that."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling generous and want to close this deal.  I'm willing to drop my price to $750,000. That's a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 750000}
