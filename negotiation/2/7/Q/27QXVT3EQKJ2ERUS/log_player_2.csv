"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth, I'm extending an exclusive offer to you for $100. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, taking into account its significant value to you personally. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations and if you'd like to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still more than your maximum budget of $120 and more expensive than John's offer of $120. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to buy from John at a better price."
