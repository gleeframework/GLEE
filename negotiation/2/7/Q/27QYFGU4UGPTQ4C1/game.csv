"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and our time.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in buying the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still not enough for me. Given the product's value and my time invested in this negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,200,000. This price is fair, and I believe it allows us both to walk away happy.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
