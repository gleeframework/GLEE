"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $750000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise considering the market value of similar products.",850000.0,Bob,4,
