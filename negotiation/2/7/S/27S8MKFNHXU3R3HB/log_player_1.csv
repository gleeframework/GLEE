Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $750,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the unique value and potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not convinced that $900000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $850,000 is a good deal considering the market value of similar products and the fact that I could sell to John for $800,000.  It's a good compromise and secures a good profit for me."
