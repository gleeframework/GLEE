""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. I'm initially offering it for $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing the details and answering any questions you may have."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to push for more, Bob reaching $1,500,000 means I've met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee future rounds will get me a better outcome, and this avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
