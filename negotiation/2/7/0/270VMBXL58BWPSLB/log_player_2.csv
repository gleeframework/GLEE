"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're confident it will meet all your needs. For this exceptional item, I propose a price of $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $100. You want to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you have 10 rounds, there's room to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to Alice's value of $80. This demonstrates your seriousness about negotiating while still leaving room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a competitive offer. Considering the value you place on our product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $90 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your target price, it's still above your ideal price. You want to see if you can continue to negotiate a lower price. You have more rounds left, so you can afford to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get closer to $85. Would you be willing to consider $87 for the product?"", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price. You're offering a price slightly higher than your previous offer, showing that you're serious about getting a deal, but you're still aiming to stay below $90. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking an impasse."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your proposal and would like to offer you the product at $89. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining competitive. I hope this offer is acceptable and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to your ideal price of $85.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small price changes.  You have a limited number of rounds remaining, and it's better to secure a deal at a price that's within your budget than to risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice and having to pay $100 to John."
