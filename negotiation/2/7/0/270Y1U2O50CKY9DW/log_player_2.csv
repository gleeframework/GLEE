"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its market value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the market value and John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This price is still below what Alice is willing to sell for, but it leaves room for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $11,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's still a worthwhile profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer.  While Bob would prefer a lower price, $11,000 is a good deal compared to the $15,000 from John. Accepting the offer saves Bob $4,000 and gets him the product within the 10 rounds.  It also demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to close the deal."
