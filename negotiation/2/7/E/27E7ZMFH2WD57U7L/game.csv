"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good value. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This price is within my budget and is a good compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still within my acceptable range and reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit.  Let's close this deal and call it a day!",940000.0,Alice,7,
