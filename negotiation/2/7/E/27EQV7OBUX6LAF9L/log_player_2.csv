"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it will be very valuable to you, and this is a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
This offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  It makes sense to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. The message is polite and explains the reasoning behind the counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $10,000 is still above your budget and what John offers. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,000 is closer, my budget is firm.  I could do $7,000.  Would that work for you?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counter-offer shows willingness to compromise while also making it clear that you have a budget limitation. Offering $7,000 keeps the negotiation moving while staying below your maximum and closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to get at least $9,000 for this product. If you can meet that, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice seems firm on $9,000, which is above your maximum budget and what John offers.  At this point, it's more beneficial to go with John's sure offer of $8,000."
