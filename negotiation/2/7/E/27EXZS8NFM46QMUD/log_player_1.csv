{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm going for a higher price than my minimum to see if I can get more. I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I'm also ready to sell to John for $80 if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate him up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Would you consider $95? It's a fair compromise and a great price for this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the highest price I was hoping for, it's still above my minimum and closer to what I initially wanted. It's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal entirely."
