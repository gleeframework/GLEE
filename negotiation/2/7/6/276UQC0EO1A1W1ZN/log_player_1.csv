"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum value.  It's important to remember that Bob might have a higher value for the product than I anticipate, so I want to leave room for him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, still above my minimum value of $12,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a decent profit margin. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm starting to consider selling to John as a safer option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $12,500. This is a significant compromise, bringing me very close to my minimum value. However, I believe it's a reasonable price that could be attractive to Bob. This is my last offer before I seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below my minimum value.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'll sell the product to John."
