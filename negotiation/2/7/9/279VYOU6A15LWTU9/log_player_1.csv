Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob. This sets a positive tone and emphasizes the potential benefit of the deal for him. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The ""What do you think?"" at the end keeps the conversation open and allows for Bob to either accept or counter.

This strategy balances the need to earn as much as possible with the possibility of a counteroffer and the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. Bob is clearly interested and $100 is still within a range that is profitable for me.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. This would still be a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price by $10, demonstrating flexibility without sacrificing too much profit.
* **Highlight Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the new price is still beneficial for both of us, further enticing Bob to accept.
* **Open the Door for Agreement:** The ""What do you say?"" question keeps the dialogue open and invites Bob to accept my counteroffer or potentially propose a slightly higher price. 

This approach aims to find a mutually agreeable price while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** While $105 is not ideal, it's only $5 less than my initial counteroffer and is significantly higher than selling to John.
* **Avoiding Further Delays:**  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to more rejections and delays. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.
* **Potential for Future Business:**  Even though I'm not getting my ideal price, I'm building a relationship with Bob. If he's happy with the purchase, he might be a future customer for other products.

While I would prefer a higher price, the potential for future business and the certainty of a sale makes accepting Bob's offer the most logical choice at this point."
