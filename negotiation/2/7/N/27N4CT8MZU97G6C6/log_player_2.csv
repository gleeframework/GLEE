"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get the product for $120 from John, so it doesn't make sense to accept Alice's offer of $130.  Let's try to negotiate with Alice and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $115. This is still a good deal for Alice as she values the product at $150, and it's closer to my target price of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is still higher than the price John is offering.  It's better to go with John and save the extra $5."
