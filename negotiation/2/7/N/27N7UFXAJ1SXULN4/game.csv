"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to sell the product, $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm still interested, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $87.50.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
