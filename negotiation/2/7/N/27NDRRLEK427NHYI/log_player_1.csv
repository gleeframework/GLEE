Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,500,000.  Here's the reasoning behind it:

* **Higher than John's offer:** This gives Bob a clear incentive to accept. He stands to make a profit if he resells the product, and there's a risk he'll lose out if he rejects.
* **Not too high:** It's still a reasonable price that could be attractive to Bob, especially if he believes the product's true value is higher.

It's a strategic balance that aims to maximize profits while also increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
