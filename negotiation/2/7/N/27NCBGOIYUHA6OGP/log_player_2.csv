Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 falls short of my minimum expectations. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I propose a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
