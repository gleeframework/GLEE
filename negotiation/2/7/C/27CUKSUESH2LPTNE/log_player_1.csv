Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I'd accept from John ($150) to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.  While the product is only worth $120 to him, there's always a chance he'll be willing to pay a bit more to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get him to budge closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $155, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and it seems like he's not willing to go higher. I'd rather sell to him than risk further negotiation or lose out to John."
