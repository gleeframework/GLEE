**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to budge much further. She's made it clear that $1,025,000 is her absolute minimum. At this point, it's more beneficial to go with the guaranteed price of $1,000,000 from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk of her holding firm, in which case Bob would end up having to choose between paying her higher price or losing out on the product altogether."
