"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? If you're open to that, we have a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,050,000 is still pushing it for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
