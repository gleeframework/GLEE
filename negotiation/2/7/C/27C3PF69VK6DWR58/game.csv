"Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering its worth $10,000 to me.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm really interested in this product and I believe that price would be fair for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
