"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always buy from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget is $8,000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering its worth $10,000 to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Alice to see if we can get closer to $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I'm really interested in this product and I believe that price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,200. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,200, which is closer to my budget, but still above my desired price point.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice. I can secure the product from John for $8,000, which is within my budget and guarantees I get the best deal."
