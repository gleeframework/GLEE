"It seems like we're getting closer, Alice. How about $71? That's just a dollar more than my last offer and could be a good compromise for both of us.",71.0,Bob,6,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $71, Bob. I can do $73 for the product. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's worth it for a product of this quality.",73.0,Alice,7,
