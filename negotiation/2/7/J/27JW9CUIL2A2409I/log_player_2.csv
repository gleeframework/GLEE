You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's room to maneuver."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its potential. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  We're going for a significant drop from Alice's initial price to demonstrate our serious intent while leaving room for negotiation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
