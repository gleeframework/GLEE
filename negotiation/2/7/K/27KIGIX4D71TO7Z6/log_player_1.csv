"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $11,500 is significantly below my minimum.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $12,500. This price reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the price I was initially considering buying from John. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's not worth risking the deal.  Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'd rather secure the sale now."
