Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer. 
* **Plan B:**  I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
