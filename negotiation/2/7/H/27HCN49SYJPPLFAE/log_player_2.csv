"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth paying $18,000 when you can get the same product from John for $15,000.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

You're willing to pay $14,000, which is still a good deal for you and potentially acceptable for Alice.  This leaves room for further negotiation but makes a clear statement that you are serious about getting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $16,500 is closer to your limit, but you can still potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500} 
``` 

This counteroffer shows you're willing to go higher than your original offer but are still firm on getting a price lower than Alice's offer.  It demonstrates you're serious about the purchase but not desperate to overpay."
