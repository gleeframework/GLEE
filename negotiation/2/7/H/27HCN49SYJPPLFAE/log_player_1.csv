Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's $15,000 offer, but I'm also willing to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell for less than my minimum of $15,000. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,500. This is still a good price for Bob, and it's a reasonable compromise from my initial offer. I believe this will encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm eager to close the deal. Accepting his offer will net me a higher price than selling to John. I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if needed."
