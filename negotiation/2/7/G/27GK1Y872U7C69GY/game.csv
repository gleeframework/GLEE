"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it represents fair value for both of us. ",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $950,000, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value I'm bringing to the table.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be, but let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
