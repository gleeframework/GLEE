"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only do it for $11,000.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, I see you're coming down a bit, which I appreciate.  Unfortunately, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for working with me on this. I'm getting closer to your price range, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Would you consider $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
