"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for working with me on this. I'm getting closer to your price range, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Would you consider $15,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice is unwilling to go below her product's value of $15,000.  Since I can get the product for $10,000 from John, it makes more sense to cut my losses with Alice and buy from John."
