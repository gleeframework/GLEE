"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is more than his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $13,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $16500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $16,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfort zone.  He should counteroffer again to try and get closer to $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you have your budget, but  $14500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's compromise again - I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for his maximum budget, and it's better than going through more rounds of negotiation. There's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and the risk of going to John is the same as accepting the current offer."
