"Hello Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $20000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $13000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $16500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you have your budget, but  $14500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's compromise again - I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! ",15000.0,Alice,5,
