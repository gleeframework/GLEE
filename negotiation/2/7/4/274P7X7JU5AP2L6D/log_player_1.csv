Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $13000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm willing to sell to John for $15,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price with Bob."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $16,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more than $14,500. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit higher.  However, if I can't get closer to my desired price, I might sell to John in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have your budget, but  $14,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's compromise again - I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 15000}
