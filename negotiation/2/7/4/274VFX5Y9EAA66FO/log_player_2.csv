"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1100000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair given its value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and continue to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows you to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's work towards a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my new offer is $1025000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is now within Bob's budget of $1,200,000. While it's not his ideal price, it's a good deal considering the limited time remaining and the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price. It's also likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly lower price, making this a good opportunity to finalize the deal."
