"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm prepared to pay $1000000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows you to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's work towards a final agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my new offer is $1025000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
