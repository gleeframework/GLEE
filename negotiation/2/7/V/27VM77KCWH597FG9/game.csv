"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $11000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12500?  That's still a good deal for a product worth this much, and it gives us both some room to compromise.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11750. Can you consider this compromise?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $12125 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and the concessions we've both made. What do you say?",12125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $11900, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",11900.0,Bob,6,
