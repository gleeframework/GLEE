"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,250,000. However, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  How about $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise and closer to where I need to be.  Let's try to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're still holding out for a bit more, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
