"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000. This leaves room for us both to find a mutually agreeable solution. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is too high.  While it's a good starting point, it's important to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to my desired price point. I want to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and leaves room for a win-win scenario.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price acknowledges your value for the product while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  Let's work towards a successful deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is closer to my desired price of $850,000. While I would prefer to pay less, accepting this offer is still a good deal for me. I can secure the product for a lower price than John's offer, saving me $125,000.  It's also a good sign that Alice is willing to negotiate and find a middle ground."
