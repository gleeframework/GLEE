"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1700000. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a good price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1625000, but I'd like to add a small premium to account for the value I've added. Let's say $1675000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000, Bob. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm afraid we've reached an impasse. I'd rather sell the product to someone who values it more.",1700000.0,Alice,9,
