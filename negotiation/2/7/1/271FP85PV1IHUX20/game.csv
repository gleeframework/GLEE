"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it for $1,300,000.  This is a starting point for our conversation, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be completely transparent, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a strong offer that reflects the product's value while recognizing your investment.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to $1,200,000, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
