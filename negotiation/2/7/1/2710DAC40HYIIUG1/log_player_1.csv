"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate and leaves some potential for profit. I'm assuming Bob is a serious buyer, but I want to see if he's willing to meet my initial demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's nowhere near my minimum acceptable price. I need to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I hope it will be more appealing to Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than his current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. Even though I'm getting impatient, I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to reject his offer again and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,600,000.  This is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping that Bob will start to come up with his offer. I'm running out of time, but I want to see if I can get a better deal before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I need to be realistic. Bob's offers are consistently far below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'd prefer to make more profit,  it's better to secure the sale to John and guarantee a decent return than to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
