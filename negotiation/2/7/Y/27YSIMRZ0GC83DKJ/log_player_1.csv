Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a reasonable starting point. It's more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but less than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, highlighting the value proposition for Bob without being overly aggressive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:** A higher initial offer can lead to a better final price.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential counteroffers.
* **Keep John in mind:**  Knowing John's offer keeps me grounded and ensures I don't get too low on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I want to maximize my profit,  I'm also aware that I have a solid backup offer from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting, I show Bob I'm not desperate and willing to wait for a better offer.
* **Explore further negotiation:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially finding a middle ground.
* **Safeguard my interests:**  If the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John and get my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,100,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Reasoning:** The message emphasizes the value Bob will get from the product and frames the offer as a win-win situation. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not giving away too much, but I'm leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find middle ground:** I'm trying to bridge the gap between our initial positions.
* **Maintain pressure:** My counteroffer still reflects the value of the product for me.
* **Keep John in the back of my mind:** I know I can sell to John for $1,500,000 if this deal falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $900,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have a reliable backup option with John.  Here's why rejecting Bob's offer is the best course of action:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting shows Bob that I'm not under pressure to accept his offer. 
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By rejecting and counteroffering, I keep the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable price alive.
* **Protect my interests:**  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 sale with John, so I can afford to be patient and hold out for a better price. 

By rejecting and counteroffering again, I can potentially push Bob closer to my desired price or, if necessary, move forward with selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still too far from my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Reasoning:**  The message highlights the value of the product and positions the offer as a good deal for both parties.
* **Maintain leverage:** This offer is still above Bob's latest offer, but leaves room for negotiation if needed.

**Strategy:**

* **Seek compromise:** I'm aiming to bridge the gap between our positions, showing flexibility without compromising too much.
* **Maintain pressure:**  My offer still reflects the significant value of the product.
* **Prepare for a potential final decision:**  This counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, so I'm prepared to either close the deal with Bob or move on to John if necessary."
