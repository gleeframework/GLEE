"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $900,000? That's a significant move on my part.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still too far from my expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your final decision.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
