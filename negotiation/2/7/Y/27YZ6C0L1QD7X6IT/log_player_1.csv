Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:** While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I want to keep the negotiation going to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:** John is a guaranteed $100, so I have a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $110 to $105.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference - $101. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 101} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($105) and Bob's current offer ($97). 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, making it more likely that Bob will accept.
* **Final Push:** This is getting close to my minimum price, so I need to push for a deal before it's too late."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Price:** Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're on round 6, and I'm worried that I might not be able to get a better price from Bob before my negotiation time runs out. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $100, which is safer than risking a lower price with Bob."
