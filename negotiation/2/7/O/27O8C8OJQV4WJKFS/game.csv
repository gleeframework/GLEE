"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However,  $12,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
