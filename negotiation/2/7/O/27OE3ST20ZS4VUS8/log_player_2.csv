"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than what you'd pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to you. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's close to Alice's minimum value ($100), but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives me a better chance of getting a deal while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still too high for me, as it's over my desired budget. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her to come down further with another counteroffer. There's still a good chance of getting a better deal without going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115, which is still below my maximum price of $150 and closer to the middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product and willing to negotiate, while still being firm about my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still too high for me.  While I could keep counteroffering, I've already reached a point where I'm getting close to my maximum price of $150.  At this point, it's more efficient to just buy the product from John.  This ensures I get the product while staying within my budget."
