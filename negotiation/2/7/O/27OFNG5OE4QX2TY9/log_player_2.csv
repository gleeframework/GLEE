"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1500000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great deal considering I could sell it to someone else for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.** Even though it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you.
* **You can still get the product from John for a higher price.** While this is your less preferred option, it's still better than accepting Alice's offer and paying more than you are willing to spend. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you put the pressure back on her. She knows she needs to sell the product, and you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her if she's worried about losing the sale to John."
