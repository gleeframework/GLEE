Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $100, so there's room for both of you to compromise and find a price that works.
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** By offering a specific price, you're demonstrating that you're interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum price of $80.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by being too stubborn."
