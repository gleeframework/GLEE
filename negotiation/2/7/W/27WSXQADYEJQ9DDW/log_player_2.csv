"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $9,500 is still higher than Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for potential compromise.
* **Politeness:** The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing Bob's own price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $11,000 reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This offer represents a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above target:** While Alice has reduced the price, $10,250 is still above Bob's desired price range.
* **Further negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a better price.  He's still significantly lower than the price from John.
* **Strategic approach:**  Rejecting the offer shows Alice that Bob is committed to getting a good deal and is not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  How about $9,750?  That's a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing he's willing to compromise but is still pushing for a lower price.
* **Highlighting Benefits:** The message emphasizes the savings for Alice, making the offer more appealing.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Bob continues to frame the counteroffer as ""fair"" for both parties, building a foundation for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's split the difference - $10,000. It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation might not be fruitful.
* **Meeting Middle Ground:** $10,000 represents a significant savings for Bob compared to John's price, and is a reasonable middle ground between Alice's last offer and Bob's last offer.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting the offer could lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing the offer entirely.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
