"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial offer of $1200000. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1050000. This feels like a fair starting point for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $1100000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions. I hope this meets your requirements, and look forward to your consideration.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1075000. This represents a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Bob. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1090000 for the product. This reflects a middle ground between our previous offers and could help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1090000 is still slightly more than I'm comfortable with.  To reach an agreement, I'm prepared to offer $1080000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and I truly believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
