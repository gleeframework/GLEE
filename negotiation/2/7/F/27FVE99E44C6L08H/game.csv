"Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,250,000 is tempting, it's still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to stay under $1,300,000. How about we settle on $1,280,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1280000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $1,300,000.  But I'm still working with a minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,300,000 is a good price point, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. How about $1,290,000? This would allow us to both close the deal and leave a little on the table for future negotiations.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm running out of time here. $1,290,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm going to offer you my final price: $1,295,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you. If you reject this offer, I'm going to sell to John for $1,500,000.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
