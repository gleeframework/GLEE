"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable, and $12,000 is  lower than I'd be comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
