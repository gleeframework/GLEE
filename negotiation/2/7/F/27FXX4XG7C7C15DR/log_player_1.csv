Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to gauge Bob's interest in the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I'll keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to drop, balancing my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above John's offer, giving me some wiggle room.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to keep Bob engaged, but still allows me to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low, and I'm starting to feel like he's not serious about negotiating in good faith.  I'm going to take John's offer and sell to him for $1,500,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I'm not going to waste any more time with Bob."
