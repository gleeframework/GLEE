Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. What do you think?

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no benefit to haggling further or going with John. It's best to accept the offer and avoid potentially complicating the deal."
