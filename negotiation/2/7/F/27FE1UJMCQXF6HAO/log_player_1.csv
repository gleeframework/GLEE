Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's a price that's still beneficial to both of us, with Bob getting a $10 discount and me getting a $30 profit.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $110. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a good profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm worried we're going to get stuck in a cycle of counteroffers. While $90 is still a decent profit, I'm not sure we'll be able to agree on a price that benefits us both. To avoid wasting more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. It's not the best outcome, but it's still better than risking no sale at all."
