"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to me and $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's a fair price given the value of the product.  What do you say?

Alice has come down in price, but it's still slightly above your desired price.  You can likely negotiate further and get closer to your target of $1,000,000."
