"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the discount, $170 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm ready to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $155 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $142.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really get a good deal. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,
