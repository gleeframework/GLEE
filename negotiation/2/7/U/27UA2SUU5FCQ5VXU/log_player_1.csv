Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. 

If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm countering with $1,250,000.  This is a substantial reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This should demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I don't undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum value, which is the most sensible choice at this point."
