"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product is $1,000,000 to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the value of the product to you while still allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $950,000. Would you be open to considering this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this offer?",960000.0,Bob,6,
