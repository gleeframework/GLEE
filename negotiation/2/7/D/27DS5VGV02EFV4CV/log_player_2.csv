Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000, which is still a great deal for you, and gets me closer to my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than her current offer of $13,000.  Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it's the best financial decision to buy from him at this point."
