"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000, which is still a great deal for you, and gets me closer to my minimum price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
