Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $9,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $7,000. Can you meet me there?

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum of $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
