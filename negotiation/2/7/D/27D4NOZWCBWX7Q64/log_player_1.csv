Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is still a good price, I can likely do better if I continue to negotiate.  I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so how about $1,250,000? This price still represents a significant value to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price point. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000, so how about $1,200,000? That's the sweet spot for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay. While I would have preferred to get a bit more, it's a good deal and avoids any further risk of negotiation."
