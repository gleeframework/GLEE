Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but it leaves room for negotiation if he's interested.
* **Limited Information:** Bob doesn't know about my deal with John. This gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
