"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm sure we can find common ground.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $107.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",107.5,Alice,5,
