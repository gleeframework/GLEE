"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
Thanks for counter-offering Alice. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle somewhat.  How about we settle at $75?,75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to give you a better deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $85. It's a good compromise considering the product's value to you.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $85 is close to what I can do, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $82, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",82.0,Alice,7,
