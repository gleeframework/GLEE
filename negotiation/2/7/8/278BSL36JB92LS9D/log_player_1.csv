Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your feedback. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is substantial, and $800,000 doesn't fully reflect that.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $850,000 is a more reasonable price for me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.

``` 
Reasoning:

Bob is now offering $850,000, which is a significant profit over John's offer of $800,000. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk Bob will walk away.  Accepting the $850,000 secures a very good deal.
