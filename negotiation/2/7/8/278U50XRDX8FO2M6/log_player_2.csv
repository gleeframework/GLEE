Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Could we settle around $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to move.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down further to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go below her stated final offer, and even at $1,250,000, you're paying more than you need to. John offers a better deal at $1,200,000.  It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the better deal."
