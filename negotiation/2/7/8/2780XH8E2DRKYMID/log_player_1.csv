Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **Maximizing profit:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Attractive to Bob:**  While $1,400,000 is less than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), it still allows him a good margin of profit. This increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a sale and a decent profit. 

By offering a price close to Bob's potential profit margin, I aim to strike a deal that benefits both parties."
