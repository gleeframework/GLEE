"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's in your best interest to negotiate for a lower price, especially since you have a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counter-offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable negotiation range. It leaves room to gradually increase the offer while gauging Alice's flexibility.
* **Budget-Minded:** Emphasizing a budget reinforces the idea that you're a serious buyer but have limits. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""Would you consider...?"" the tone remains polite and suggests a willingness to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what John is offering. You have room to negotiate further and see if Alice will come down closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your target.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating you're ""ready to close the deal,"" it signals that you're serious and encourages Alice to make a decision. 
* **John as Leverage:** While you haven't explicitly mentioned John, Alice likely knows there are other sellers in the market, adding subtle pressure to negotiate fairly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not ready to give up on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $8,500, and has indicated this is her lowest price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll budge.  At this point, John's offer of $8,000 is the better deal. You've successfully negotiated Alice down, but it's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price."
