Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $100, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is still above my minimum, but I'm willing to lower my initial price to try and reach a compromise.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough. I've already lowered my price twice, and I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to compromise. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price, I'm choosing to sell to John for $100, which is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirement."
