"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $950,000 is closer, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This is still a good deal for you and leaves me with a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
