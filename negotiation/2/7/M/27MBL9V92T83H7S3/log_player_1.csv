Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is far too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$950,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $950,000 is closer, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This is still a good deal for you and leaves me with a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
