Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than the $800,000 I'd get from John.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. $900,000 is closer to my minimum than his initial offer, and I'm confident I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and finalize the deal with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob. Selling to John for $800,000 would mean missing out on the potential for a higher price."
