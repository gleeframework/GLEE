Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $120 as possible since that's my guaranteed profit with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 gives Bob the impression of a deal while leaving me a small buffer if he tries to negotiate down. 
* **Avoid Overpricing:**  If I go too high above $100 (Bob's perceived value), he'll likely reject it outright."
