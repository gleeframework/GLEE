**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she is unlikely to meet your $800,000 limit. She is drawing a hard line. You can continue negotiating, but you risk her increasing her price or the negotiation going nowhere.  It's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
