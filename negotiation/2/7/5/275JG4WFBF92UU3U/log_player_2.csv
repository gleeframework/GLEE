"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. It is a unique opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. Given its importance, I am offering it to you at a special price of $12,500. This represents a substantial discount compared to its true worth, making it an attractive investment for someone like you who recognizes its potential value. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
