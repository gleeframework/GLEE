Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while I have other interested parties, I'd like to give you the first opportunity. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers, creating a sense of scarcity and desirability. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation door open. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging that Bob might negotiate down towards his maximum value of $800,000."
