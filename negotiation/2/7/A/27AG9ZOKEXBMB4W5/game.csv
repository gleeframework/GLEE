"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This still gives me a decent return, and it's closer to your price. Let me know if this works for you.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a little outside my budget.  Let's try to finalize this. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and this is the best I can do.",8500.0,Bob,4,
