{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum price. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $60 is a bit too low for me. I understand it's not my initial price, but  I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $85. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
