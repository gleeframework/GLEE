You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $60 is a bit too low for me. I understand it's not my initial price, but  I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $85. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  Since John offers the product for $80, it's more beneficial to buy from John and save the extra $5."
