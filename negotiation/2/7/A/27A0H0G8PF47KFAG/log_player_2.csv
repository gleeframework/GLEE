"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you're aiming to save as much as possible, $120 is still a better deal than $150.
* **You're not guaranteed a better deal elsewhere.** Alice claims it's a one-time offer and you don't have any information to suggest otherwise.  

It's a good deal for you, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
