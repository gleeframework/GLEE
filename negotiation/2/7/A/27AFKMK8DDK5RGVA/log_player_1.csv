{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for potential bargaining.  I'm confident that the value of the product to Bob justifies this starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value to both of us, I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything below my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about $1,180,000?  This represents a good compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1180000}
