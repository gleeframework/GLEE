"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $850,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $975,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $975,000 is still more than I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a premium for this product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this work. How about $937,500? This splits the difference on our last offers and keeps us moving towards a fair deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,
