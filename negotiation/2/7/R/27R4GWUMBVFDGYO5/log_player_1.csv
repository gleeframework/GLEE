Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer at $9,750. Can you consider this revised offer?

You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to take the sure $10,000 than risk Bob walking away in future rounds."
