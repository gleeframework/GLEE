"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. He has 10 rounds and can always go to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest price possible.  While $13,500 is closer to his desired price, he can likely push for a lower offer. He still has 7 rounds to work with before needing to resort to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  Let's try $13,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 13250}
