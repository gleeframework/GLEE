"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than I'm looking for. Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,000,000. Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still looking to get a better deal.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $975,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $972,500. This is a compromise that takes into account your desire to split the difference, but still reflects the product's true value.",972500.0,Alice,5,
