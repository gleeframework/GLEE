"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12800.0,Alice,5,
