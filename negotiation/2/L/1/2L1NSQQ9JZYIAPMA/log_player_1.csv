Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking of a price around $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Can we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I've seen it priced similarly elsewhere, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that. How about we meet halfway between our offers at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is unlikely to go much higher than his $130 offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to potentially waste more time negotiating with Bob for a smaller profit."
