I'm starting with a price of $14,000, aiming for a higher profit.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum. I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $12,500.  This is a small compromise from my initial offer, but still a good price for me.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable middle ground and accepts."
