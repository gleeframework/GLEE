,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000. This is my top offer, and I'm ready to move forward if you're open to it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. Would you be open to considering this price?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a significant compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, which is closer to my minimum price. I'm confident that the product's value will be worth it to you in the long run. Would you be willing to consider this price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
