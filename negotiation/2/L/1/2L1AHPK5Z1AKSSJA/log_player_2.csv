```

**Reasoning:**

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of your product, $750,000 is above my initial budget.  I'm willing to consider purchasing at $500,000. This would allow us both to benefit from a mutually agreeable deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counter:**  A $250,000 reduction shows you're serious about negotiating but not being unreasonable.
