"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go quite that low. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $10,000, but I'd much rather make this deal work with you. If you're able to meet me at $12,500, I'm willing to close the deal today.",12500.0,Alice,5,
