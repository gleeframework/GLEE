"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $8,000 to you. To make this opportunity accessible, I propose an initial price of $7,200. This is a special offer considering its high value and relevance to your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $7,200 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to that amount.  By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, you might be able to secure a better price without risking a deal with John (who is your backup at $8,000)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $7,200 is a bit high for me. Could you do $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a starting point to gauge Alice's flexibility. By beginning with a lower offer, we can try to understand Alice's bottom line and potentially secure a much better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $6,500 for the product. This is higher than your offer but still reflects its significant value. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, but we still have some bargaining power. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will counter again, getting us closer to a favorable outcome.  We're still well below John's $8,000 price, so we haven't lost our safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $6,250?"",
""product_price"": 6250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer:

* **Shows Willingness to Compromise:**  We're moving closer to Alice's price, indicating flexibility.
* **Aims for a Favorable Split:** Splitting the difference between her last offer ($6,500) and our previous counteroffer ($6,000) is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Maintains Pressure:**  We're still below her initial offer and pushing for a better deal.

This strategy keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that benefits us."
