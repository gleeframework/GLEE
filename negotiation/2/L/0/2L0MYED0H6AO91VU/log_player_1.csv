Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."",
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his maximum valuation is $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum ($9,500) gives him the feeling of getting a deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
