Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price.**  At $1,050,000, Bob is still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John. 
* **The negotiation has been going on for a while.** There's a chance that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away. 
* **It's important to weigh the potential savings against the risk of losing the deal.** In this case, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
