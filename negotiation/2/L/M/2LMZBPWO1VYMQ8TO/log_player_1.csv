"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  This price is significantly higher than my minimum but gives Bob a decent discount from his estimated value. I want to see how he responds and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. This shows him I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a higher price.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer slightly, and while it's still not ideal, it's close enough to my desired price point. Given the limited rounds, accepting his offer ensures a good profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
