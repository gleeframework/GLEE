Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum value of the product for me. Since I can sell it to John for the same price, it makes sense to accept and finalize the deal."
