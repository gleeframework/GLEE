{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider a counter-offer.  This allows Alice to potentially get a better price while also leaving room for a potential counter-offer from Bob.  Alice can then decide whether to accept Bob's counteroffer or stick with her initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  By rejecting, Alice can continue the negotiation and potentially get a better price from Bob or choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This would still be a great value for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 15500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $13,000. How about we try $14,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Alice should choose to sell to John.  Bob's counteroffer of $14,250 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  At this point, John offers a price that meets Alice's minimum and provides certainty.  It's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
