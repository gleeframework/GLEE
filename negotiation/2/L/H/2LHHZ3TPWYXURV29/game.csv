"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for coming down to $12000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11200. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",11200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $11200 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11600? This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11600.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $11300. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I want to be fair.  $11300 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make a final compromise.  I'll accept $11400.  This is my last offer, and if we can't come to an agreement, I'll need to move on.",11400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't agree on that price, I'll need to explore other options.",11200.0,Bob,8,
