"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. I need to negotiate a lower price. It's too early to buy from John as there's a chance I can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my own budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to see a higher offer. I'm prepared to sell for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that accounts for the product's value and your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is within my budget.  While I'd prefer a lower price, further negotiation may lead to a stalemate or force me to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget."
