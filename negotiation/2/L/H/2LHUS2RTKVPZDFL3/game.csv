"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm sensing we're both invested in reaching a deal here.  To show I'm serious, I'll come up to $10,000.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $10,300. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10300.0,Alice,7,
