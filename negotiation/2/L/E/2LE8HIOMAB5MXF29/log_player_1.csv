Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get more than my minimum of $80.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay more than $80, as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is better than my minimum of $80 and is still within the range where it's likely to be acceptable to him.  I'm happy to accept and move on."
