"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I appreciate you reaching out.  While I'm interested in the product, $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $12000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $13500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. How about $13000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. This is already a compromise from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to go up to $13500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this.  What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $13800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",13800.0,Alice,7,
