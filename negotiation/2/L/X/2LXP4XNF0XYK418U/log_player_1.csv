Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a more reasonable price, the difference between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is now minimal. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a worse deal.  Selling to John guarantees the $10,000 and avoids further haggling."
