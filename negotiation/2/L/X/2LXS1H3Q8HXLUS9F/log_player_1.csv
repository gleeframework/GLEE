"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. 

This strategy has the following advantages:

* **Sets a high baseline:** It positions me as a seller who values the product highly.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** I can lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary. 
* **Potential for a good deal:** If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to pay a higher price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating with him or switch to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to close a deal, accepting such a low offer would mean a substantial loss. 

Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to my desired price.  I still have 8 rounds left, giving me ample opportunity to explore a better deal.  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I'm aiming higher and see if I can improve upon that with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This strategy is based on the following logic:

* **Firm but fair:** It signals that I am serious about selling the product but am not willing to accept a significantly lower price.
* **Potential for quick agreement:** If Bob is genuinely interested, he might be willing to accept this price, especially given his initial offer of $800,000.
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still switch to John and receive a guaranteed $1,200,000.

This strategy is designed to find a compromise between my goal of maximizing profit and the need to reach a deal within a reasonable timeframe."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss.

Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating.  With 6 rounds remaining, there's still room for a better deal.  Although selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I'm hoping for a higher price.  I'll continue to assess Bob's offers and see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,100,000.  This is a compromise between my last offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's latest offer of $950,000. This strategy has the following benefits:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** Demonstrates that I'm open to finding a middle ground.
* **Increases the likelihood of a deal:** A closer price gap makes a deal more likely.
* **Maintains my advantage:** It's still higher than Bob's last offer, keeping me in a favorable position.

This counteroffer strategically balances the need to secure a deal while also maximizing my potential profit. If Bob rejects again, I can consider selling to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000 or make a final counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a loss, and I still have 4 rounds left. I believe there's potential for a better deal.

Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating. I'll analyze the situation and make a calculated counteroffer in the next round. Although selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, I'm hoping for a higher price.  I believe with a strategic counteroffer, I can still reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This strategy is based on the following reasoning:

* **Testing the waters:** I want to see how close Bob is to accepting a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's latest offer of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While offering a compromise, I'm still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to make a decision: 

* **Accept Bob's next offer:**  If his next offer is close to $1,150,000, I might accept it to close the deal quickly.
* **Sell to John:** If his offer remains significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, I'll consider selling to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000, as time is running out.
* **Final counteroffer:** If there is time left, I could make a final counteroffer to Bob. However, with only 3 rounds remaining, I'll need to be cautious about risking a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still not enough. With only two rounds left, time is running out, but I'm not willing to settle for a loss.

Rejecting the offer allows me to make a final counteroffer in the next round. I believe there's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.  

I'll make a counteroffer that is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll switch to selling to John and guarantee myself $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's latest offer.  With only one round left, I'm taking a calculated risk.  

* **Compromise:** This shows a willingness to meet halfway and potentially close the deal.
* **Last chance:** This is my last opportunity to negotiate with Bob before selling to John.
* **Potential for a deal:** Bob might be willing to accept this offer, as it's only $50,000 lower than my previous offer.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'm hoping that Bob recognizes the value of the product and accepts this final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round of negotiations, and time is up. Although Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a loss.

Since I have no more rounds to negotiate, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me a profit and ensures I won't lose money on this deal. While I would have preferred to earn more, selling to John is the most practical decision given the circumstances."
