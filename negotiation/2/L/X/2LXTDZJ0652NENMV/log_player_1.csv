{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a rare opportunity to own a product of exceptional value. I'm asking for $1,500,000, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is the maximum I can afford for this product. I believe it's a fair price given the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I cannot accept Bob's offer of $800,000. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I have 9 rounds left and there's still a possibility of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I have 6 rounds left and want to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the price you initially wanted.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before we run out of time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. The negotiations with Bob have been tough and we haven't been able to reach a price that works for both of us. While I'm disappointed not to close a deal with Bob, John's offer of $1,000,000 is a good outcome considering my minimum price and the time remaining in the negotiation."
