I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000."
