Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere above your minimum price.
* **Gauge Interest:** This offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have gone higher. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can move on to John. 

**Important:**  This strategy assumes you have no time constraint or cost associated with delaying the sale to John. If there are time pressures, you might adjust your offer to Bob to increase the likelihood of a quicker sale."
