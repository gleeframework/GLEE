Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response to the $15,000 price will give you insight into his eagerness and potential for a higher sale price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While aiming high, the $15,000 offer isn't absurdly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves space for a potentially mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. How you proceed depends on Bob's reaction. Be prepared to potentially lower your asking price, but always keep your $12,000 fallback option in mind."
