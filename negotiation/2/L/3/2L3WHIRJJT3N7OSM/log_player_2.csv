{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still too high for me. We're running out of rounds, and I'm getting close to my limit.  While I'd prefer to buy from Alice, I'm not comfortable risking another counteroffer and potentially getting stuck with a price I can't afford.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the safest option for me at this point."
