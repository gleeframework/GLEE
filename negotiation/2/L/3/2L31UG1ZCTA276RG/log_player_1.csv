Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher price ($130) allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have John as a backup buyer at $80, ensuring you won't be stuck with the product if Bob declines.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some flexibility in your pricing and are comfortable with a bit of back-and-forth negotiation."
