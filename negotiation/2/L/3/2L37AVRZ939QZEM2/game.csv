"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe this product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. How about we try $8,700? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I can afford it.",8700.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again. Would you consider $8,850? This is a fair price for a product that can bring you so much value.",8850.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $8,750? I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I can afford it.",8750.0,Bob,6,
