"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $110? That's a good middle ground, and it's the most I'm willing to pay.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop to $115.  This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal and both be happy.",115.0,Alice,5,
