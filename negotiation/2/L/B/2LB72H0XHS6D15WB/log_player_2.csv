"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and his maximum budget is $80. This counteroffer directly reflects his budget and gives Alice a clear idea of his limit. It's a bold move, but it might get the negotiation moving towards a more acceptable price for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $110, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further or if a compromise can be reached.  Bob doesn't want to overpay, especially when he has a reliable alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is strategically increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product.  $90 is a midpoint between his previous offer of $80 and Alice's offer of $110.  It's a reasonable compromise that might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit too high.  He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price, especially since John is a reliable alternative at $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is sticking with his strategy of meeting Alice halfway.  He's raised his offer to $95, demonstrating his willingness to compromise but still staying within a reasonable range.  This offer could be the sweet spot that convinces Alice to accept and allows Bob to get a decent deal without going over his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $102 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80, and there are only 3 rounds left. Given that he has a reliable alternative with John, who is selling the same product for $80, it's better for Bob to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will come down to a price that works for Bob in the remaining rounds, and he shouldn't risk losing a good deal with John."
