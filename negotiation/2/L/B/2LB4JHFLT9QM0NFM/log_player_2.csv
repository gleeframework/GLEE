"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than the standard market price. I'm willing to extend this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price than Alice's initial offer, but he's still being reasonable.  The counteroffer of $13,000 is within his budget and likely still profitable for Alice, leaving room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your interest in our product. To find a middle ground, I propose an offer of $13,500 for the product. This allows us to move forward while still providing you with a significant discount compared to the market value. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's within Bob's budget and still represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $15,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a favorable price without risking further negotiations that could potentially lead to a higher price or a failed deal."
