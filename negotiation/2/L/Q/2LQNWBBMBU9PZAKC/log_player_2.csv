"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,400,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  By rejecting, he can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate, but is still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what John is offering. He can continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

```

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it below John's price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also shows that he's not willing to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and it's unclear if she's willing to come down further.  It's more advantageous to secure the product from John at a known and lower price."
