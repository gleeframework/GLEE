"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if the product is worth $120 to me.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
