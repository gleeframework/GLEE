Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This increases the likelihood Bob will accept the offer. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** If Bob rejects, I can still lower the price slightly if necessary without jeopardizing my minimum profit.

I'll keep an eye on the negotiation and be ready to either accept a counteroffer from Bob or move on to John if the deal seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as I can, and I'm not sure if the product is worth $120 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still below my minimum desired price, it's closer to it than Bob's previous offer. This negotiation seems to be reaching a stalemate, and continuing to reject offers could risk losing both Bob and John as buyers.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure a sale, which is better than risking losing both buyers entirely."
