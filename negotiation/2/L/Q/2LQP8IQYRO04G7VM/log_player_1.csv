Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay more, especially if it's something he really wants.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A price of $130 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above our Minimum:**  Most importantly, this offer ensures we still make a profit above our minimum of $150 if Bob accepts. If he declines, we have John as a guaranteed buyer."
