# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  Would you be interested in paying $9,500 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500 
* **John's price:** $10,000
* **Your maximum:** $10,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $10,000 to John, but it's still within your budget and saves you $500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
