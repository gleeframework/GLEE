Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is much higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

We're increasing our offer slightly to show willingness to negotiate, but still staying significantly below her asking price.  Let's see how she responds."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000.
