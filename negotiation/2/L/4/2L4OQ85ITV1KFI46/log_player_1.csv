"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting high (but below Bob's perceived value) anchors the negotiation in our favor. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price makes it seem less arbitrary and more palatable to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and for us to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement while still remaining well above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good one, we're still early in the negotiation. We have room to push for a higher price. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and signals that we're aiming for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, the value this product brings to the table warrants a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?"",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Gradually:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but in a controlled manner, showing willingness to negotiate but not giving up too much ground.
* **Middle Ground:** Suggesting a middle ground price can often be an effective negotiation tactic, creating a sense of fairness. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer keeps us well above our minimum acceptable price and allows for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to keep my investment under $1,500,000. I would like to counter your offer with $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer to $1,250,000. This is a substantial amount and a $450,000 profit over our minimum acceptable price.  While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob could walk away or that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome. It's a good deal, and accepting now secures a significant profit."
