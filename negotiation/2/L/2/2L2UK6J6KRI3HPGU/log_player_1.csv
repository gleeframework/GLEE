I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my initial price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintain a profit margin.  It's a compromise that might be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is far too low. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoid further time-consuming negotiations."
