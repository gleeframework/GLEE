"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to budge a bit more, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
