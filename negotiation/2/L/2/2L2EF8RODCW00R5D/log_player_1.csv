Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price because I know I can get $120 from John if Bob rejects my offer.  This gives me the best chance to get my desired price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm offering $110, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility and could lead to a faster agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a bit more than $120, I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer and will pay on time.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge much, and continuing to negotiate risks losing time and possibly getting a worse deal. Selling to John guarantees my minimum price and avoids further potential delays."
