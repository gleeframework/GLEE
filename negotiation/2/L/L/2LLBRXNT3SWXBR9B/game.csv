"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $13500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $13500 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $13000?  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy at this price.",13000.0,Bob,4,
