"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going below $1,025,000. I think this is the lowest price I can accept and still make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
