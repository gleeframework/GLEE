"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might yield a slightly better price, but the potential savings are not worth the risk of her increasing her price or the time spent haggling. John offers a sure thing at a very good price."
