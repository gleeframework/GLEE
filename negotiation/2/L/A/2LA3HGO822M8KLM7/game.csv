"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering the product at $12,000, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price even further? I'm willing to consider offers up to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand you're working within a budget,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable accepting.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to stay within a reasonable range. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still seeking to keep my spending below $10,000 if possible. Could you consider bringing the price down to $9,500? This would be a significant improvement over the original offer and closer to what I'm able to spend.",9500.0,Bob,4,
