"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to me is capped at $1500000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This still leaves plenty of room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope you can consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
