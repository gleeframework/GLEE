"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the consideration. However, I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about I offer to purchase your product for $950,000? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
