Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Strong But Not Greedy:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value shows you understand the product's worth to him, without seeming overly aggressive or greedy.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the offer attractive to Bob."
