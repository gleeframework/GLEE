Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would benefit from a deal exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and market value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Justifiable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing you a significant profit.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes value and fairness, increasing the likelihood of Bob considering the offer seriously.
* **No Mention of John:**  Revealing your backup buyer weakens your position.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly based on Bob's response.  However, never go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
