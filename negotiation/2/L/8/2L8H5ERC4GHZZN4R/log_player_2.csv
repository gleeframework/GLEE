"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. This price reflects not only its worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its market value of $120. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with her or sticking with John's offer as your backup."
