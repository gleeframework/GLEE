Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
