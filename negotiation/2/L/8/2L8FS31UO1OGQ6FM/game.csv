"Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you being upfront with your offer.  While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17000 to make this deal work.  It's still a great value considering the unique benefits of this product.  What do you say?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13500?  I'm really eager to buy this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
