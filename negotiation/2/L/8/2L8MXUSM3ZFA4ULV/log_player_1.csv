Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to me, I'm not willing to go lower than that. I know Bob is interested, but I'm hoping to push him towards my price. If he rejects, I'll have to consider his counteroffer, but I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is closer to my ideal price than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. This counteroffer is $50,000 higher than his offer, but still $50,000 lower than my ideal price.  This shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still less than my ideal price, it's getting close.  I think I can close the deal at this price. It's also a lot more than Bob's initial offer, and there's a risk that if I reject again, he might get frustrated and walk away. Selling to John is also a good option, but I'm confident I can get a slightly better price from Bob."
