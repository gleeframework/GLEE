{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [product name].  My initial price is $1,650,000, reflecting its exceptional value.  I'm confident this is a price that's fair for both of us. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree [product name] has exceptional value, $1,650,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,350,000. This offer stands as a fair reflection of its market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,350,000 is a decent starting point, it's still below my minimum.  I have 9 more rounds to try and close the deal with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This price still reflects the exceptional value of [product name] while being fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to stay above your minimum. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. How about $1,400,000?  This price recognizes the value of [product name] while keeping it within a reasonable range for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,450,000 yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm confident that [product name] is worth more than that. Let's try $1,425,000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1425000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,410,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,410,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,410,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there, and with only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with him becomes greater.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  It's a good deal and secures me the minimum I want."
