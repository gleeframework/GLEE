"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $9800, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Can you consider $10200?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your offer of $10200. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $10400. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10400.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to accept $10400. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
