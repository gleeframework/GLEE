{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest without immediately losing a potential sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also below the price I initially offered him, so I need to see if he's willing to come up in price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
