"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's less than the price from John, there's still room for negotiation to save more money. Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but also reasonable. Offering $900,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's desire to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves some room for profit considering Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000. Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially ending the negotiation is not worth the potential savings."
