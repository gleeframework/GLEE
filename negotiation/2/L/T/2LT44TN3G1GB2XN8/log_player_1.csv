Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. It's a great deal for something of this quality!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:** If Bob refuses, we can sell to John for $150. 

Therefore, offering the product slightly below John's price creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""good deal"" for Bob, while still securing a profit above Bob's valuation."
