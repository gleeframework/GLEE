"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to be sure it's the best price I can get. Can you consider $960,000?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'd love to get closer to your offer,  $960,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $970,000, which is a very fair compromise.  This is a valuable product, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price.  Let's make this deal happen!",970000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $970,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $965,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price?",965000.0,Bob,8,
