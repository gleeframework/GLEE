"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than what Bob values it at ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone might encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a Backup:** Having the option to sell to John for $100 gives me leverage in the negotiation. I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $102.50?  This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm using a counter-offer to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I have a lower limit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Offering $102.50, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. I am willing to pay $97.5 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $97.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Going Too Low:** If I accept this offer, I'm essentially losing money on the product. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I can always sell to John for $100, which provides a safety net in this negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm still a bit away from your offer. Let's try $99.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Almost There:** I'm getting close to my minimum price of $100, but I'm still trying to get a little more.
* **Final Offer Strategy:** This counteroffer is meant to be a final offer that I'm willing to accept. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Confidence:**  My message expresses confidence that Bob will find the product worth the price."
