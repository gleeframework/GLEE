"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good deal. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be able to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000. Bob's rejection of the initial offer indicates he values the product, and I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000, which is still significantly above my minimum and closer to my initial asking price. This shows flexibility while still attempting to secure a favorable deal.  By lowering the price, I'm increasing the chances of Bob accepting, but I'm still leaving room for potential negotiation in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $1,000 less than my previous counteroffer and significantly more than John's offer.  Given that we're already at round 4, it's likely that further negotiation will be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price.  Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the limited rounds."
