"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and express continued interest:**  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away.
* **Start low but within reason:** $70 is a significant drop from $90, but it's still a profitable price for Alice (who values the product at $80).
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This initial counter-offer gives us space to potentially meet in the middle if Alice counters."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than the original offer, we can still try to negotiate a bit further down towards our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $75? That seems like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Acknowledges compromise:** We start by recognizing Alice's effort to meet in the middle, building goodwill.
* **Proposes a middle ground:** $75 is directly between our previous offer ($70) and Alice's current one ($80).
* **Maintains firmness:** We haven't drastically increased our offer, showing we're serious about a lower price.

We're aiming for a win-win situation â€“ a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $78. It's still a bit above my minimum price, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $78
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's time to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Good Price:** $78 is significantly lower than John's price of $120 and a reasonable saving from our initial target.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Further haggling over a few dollars might frustrate Alice, leading her to walk away. It's better to secure a good deal now. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort. This offer is good enough to move on."
