"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product at a special price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 and John is willing to sell for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price."
