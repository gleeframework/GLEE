"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good price for a product worth $120. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I admire your negotiation skills!  However, $85 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement.",87.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82.50?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $82.50 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85 one last time. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's make this happen.",85.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $85, which would be $83.75. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",83.75,Bob,8,
