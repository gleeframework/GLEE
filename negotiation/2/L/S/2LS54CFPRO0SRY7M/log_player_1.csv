"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a decent compromise between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a good incentive to negotiate, but also ensures I don't lose out on too much profit in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good price for a product worth $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90, which is still above my minimum and shows flexibility. I'm also reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize the potential savings. This approach aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm not ready to accept this price yet. I believe there is still some room for negotiation, and I'd like to see if I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I admire your negotiation skills!  However, $85 is still a bit below where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

I'm offering $87.50, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. I'm also framing it as a fair price for both of us, emphasizing the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement. This approach aims to build consensus and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $82.50 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a bit too low for me. I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a price closer to my target. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that's more in line with my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $82.50 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85 one last time. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85 again, but this time I'm emphasizing that it's my final offer. I'm also adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept. This approach aims to push Bob towards a decision and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82.50 and $85, which would be $83.75. Would you be willing to accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $83.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $83.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting very close to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.  With only two rounds left, I risk not getting a better deal.  I'm running out of time, and I don't want to take the chance of getting stuck with a lower price.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed sale with John."
