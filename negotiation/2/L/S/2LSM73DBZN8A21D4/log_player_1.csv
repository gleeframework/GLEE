Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000** is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message** is friendly and direct, but also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher price while still leaving room for counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I can assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and availability. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $850,000 is below my minimum desired price of $800,000.** While it's tempting to accept to avoid a longer negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for less than my minimum, especially since I have John's guaranteed offer of $800,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob.** This keeps the potential for a higher price open.  I'll likely counteroffer with a price closer to my desired $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. I'd be happy to accept $900,000 for the product.  This price still offers you significant value, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $900,000:** This is a compromise, coming down from the initial $950,000 but still above my minimum. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasize Value:**  The message reinforces the value of the product to Bob, highlighting the potential savings he'll get even at $900,000.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone encourages a positive outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still working within a tight budget. I would like to propose an offer of $875,000 for the product. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests and could be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum desired price of $800,000.** This means I'm making a profit and securing a sale.
* **While I'd prefer $900,000, further negotiation may not be worth the time and risk.**  There's always the possibility that Bob might become less willing to negotiate or even walk away. 
* **Accepting Bob's offer provides a clear and guaranteed outcome.**  It's a good deal, and I can move on to other opportunities."
