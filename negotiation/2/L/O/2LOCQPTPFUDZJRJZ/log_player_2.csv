Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $800,000? That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?
