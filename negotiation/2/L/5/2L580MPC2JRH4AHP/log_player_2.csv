"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significantly lower counteroffer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a clear expectation of a substantial price reduction. It's likely Alice will reject this, but it forces her to counter with a price closer to Bob's target range.  It's a strategy to quickly establish a lower negotiating point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his desired price.  There is still room for negotiation, and Bob is motivated to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is a middle ground between his budget and Alice's previous offer. It shows that he's serious about a deal but still wants a significant discount. This counteroffer is likely to be accepted by Alice, as it's close to her previous offer and within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's budget and closer to John's price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get closer to his target price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiations and try to achieve a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been slowly increasing his counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. This offer of $14,500 is a compromise, showing that Bob is serious about getting a deal done. It's also a psychologically appealing number, being in the middle ground between his last offer and Alice's latest one. This strategy might be enough to convince Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $100 less than John's price. Bob has already reached his budget limit.  There are only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely that Alice will come down further. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and saves valuable time."
