,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the condition of the product, $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, which is what I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if that works for you.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $160.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable going to John if we can't reach an agreement.",160.0,Bob,4,
