"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  I'm confident that it's worth at least $1 million to you. To make this a win-win, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a significant price point for me, but I want to give you the first chance to acquire it.  Please let me know your decision.",900000.0,Alice,1,
