"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $13,250 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward with the sale. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $13,250 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he's already established that he can get the product for $12,000 from John. There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
