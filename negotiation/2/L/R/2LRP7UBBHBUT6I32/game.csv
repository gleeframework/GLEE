"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,050,000 is the highest I can go.  If you're firm on $1,100,000 I'll unfortunately have to consider my other options.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,100,000.
