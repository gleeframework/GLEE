"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still feeling a bit stretched.  I'm prepared to go up to $10,750 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise, given the value you've placed on it and my budget. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11,250. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
