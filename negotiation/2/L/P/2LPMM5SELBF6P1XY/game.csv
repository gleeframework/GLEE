"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe the product is a great fit for me, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $800000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering our product, Bob. While I understand your budgetary constraints, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $800000. Our product carries significant value, and we believe it's worth the original asking price of $1500000. However, I am willing to negotiate within reason. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget with the $1000000 offer. Would you be willing to meet me at $900000? I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After careful consideration, I'm willing to consider an offer closer to your suggested price. However, I cannot agree to $900000. How about we aim for $950000? This reflects a compromise between our positions and maintains a reasonable profit margin for us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $925000? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",925000.0,Bob,6,
