"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price is fair considering my budget and the potential benefits the product offers. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product can bring to your business. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is the very top of my price range and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,100,000, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm confident that this price is still a great value for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,5,
