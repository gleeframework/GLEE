{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm going to keep pushing for a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $92. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92}

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price and I'm concerned that Bob won't budge further.  Instead of risking more rounds of negotiation with uncertain results, I'm going to sell to John for the guaranteed $120."
