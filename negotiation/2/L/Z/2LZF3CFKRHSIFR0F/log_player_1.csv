Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount (making it attractive), and you secure almost the full value he places on the item.
* **Backup Offer:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for $100, ensuring you don't lose out."
