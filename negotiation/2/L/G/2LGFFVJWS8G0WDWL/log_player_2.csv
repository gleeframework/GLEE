# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. It aligns perfectly with your current needs and has the potential to generate significant returns. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,050,000, reflecting its exceptional quality and the value it brings. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision, and we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and scarcity, but you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  There's no logical reason to pay $50,000 more than you need to."
