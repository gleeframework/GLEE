"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I'm confident it will be highly valuable for your business. My asking price is $1400000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,400,000.  While Alice values the product at $1,000,000, you value it at $1,500,000.  This means there's a significant margin for negotiation. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1200000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get an even lower price.  You value the product at $1,500,000, so you can afford to be a bit more aggressive in your negotiation."
