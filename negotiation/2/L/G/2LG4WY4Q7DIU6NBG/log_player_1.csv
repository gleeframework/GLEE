Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $14,999. I believe it offers significant value and would be a great purchase for you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While close to your minimum, the price of $14,999 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  The price of $14,999 is just below the $15,000 mark, potentially making it seem more appealing to Bob.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He may try to negotiate a lower price, or he may reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance to maximize your profit while still having the security of John's offer."
