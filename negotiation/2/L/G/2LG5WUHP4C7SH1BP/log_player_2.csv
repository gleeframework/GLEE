(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring negotiation to see if a better price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum budget while still leaving room for negotiation. He acknowledges the value of the product but highlights his financial constraints.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,500. It's the best I can do, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My counteroffer is $13,250 for the product. This price reflects the value you see in it while allowing us to move forward with the transaction. I look forward to your response.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price further, $13,250 is still outside Bob's budget. He has a reliable alternative with John, who is willing to sell the product for $12,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, but if she doesn't come down further, Bob should be prepared to walk away and buy from John."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $13,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```
