Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something of such high value."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it hints at its high value. This creates a sense of scarcity and desirability.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for him to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price still significantly higher than your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes haggling, a slightly lower starting price might be more effective.
* **Market Conditions:**  While not explicitly stated, understanding if similar products are in high demand could influence your pricing strategy."
