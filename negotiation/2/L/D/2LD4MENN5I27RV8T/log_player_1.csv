Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, but I believe it's a fair price considering my own value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:

This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  I believe this is a reasonable price considering my own valuation, and I hope we can reach an agreement.
