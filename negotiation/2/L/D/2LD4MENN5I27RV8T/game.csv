"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, but I believe it's a fair price considering my own value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is too far below its value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  I believe this is a reasonable price considering my own valuation, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. How about $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while hopefully still working within your budget.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
