"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far above Bob's budget of $800,000. It's clear that negotiation is necessary.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is the absolute maximum I can afford, but I believe it's a fair price considering my own value for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is too far below its value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still much higher than Bob's budget.  It's important to keep negotiating and pushing for a lower price. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue the dialogue and try to get closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  I believe this is a reasonable price considering my own valuation, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. How about $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while hopefully still working within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still too high for Bob.  Although she's come down from her original price, it's getting close to the point where it's no longer worth the negotiation.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further back-and-forth with Alice.  This saves him both time and money."
