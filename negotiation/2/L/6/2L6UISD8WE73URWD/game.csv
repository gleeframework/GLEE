"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $130. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll love the product.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $140. How about we try again? I'm willing to meet you at $147. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",147.0,Alice,5,
