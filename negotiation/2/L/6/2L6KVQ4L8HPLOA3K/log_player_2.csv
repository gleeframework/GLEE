"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers. I'm confident this is a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:**  The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating that you are serious about negotiating. 
* **Justifying the Offer:** The message explains your reasoning for the lower price, focusing on the product's value to you.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** Framing the offer as a ""win-win"" can make Alice more receptive.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $975,000? This would allow us both to move forward with a deal that's fair and beneficial."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer focuses on finding a middle ground, suggesting a split of the difference between the previous offer and your last counteroffer.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,025,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal at $990,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

With only three rounds remaining, it's important to continue negotiating to secure the best possible deal."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $995,000.  This would represent a significant savings for me, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal to everyone's satisfaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After further consideration, I am willing to offer the product at $1,005,000. This price aims to provide a fair valuation while also allowing for a reasonable profit margin. I believe this is a fair compromise that could facilitate a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, the negotiation has stalled. Alice's offer of $1,005,000 is still higher than your desired price.  It's highly unlikely that you'll be able to get her down to your target price in just one round.  While buying from John is more expensive, it guarantees you the product and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing completely.  It's better to secure the product now, even at a higher price, than risk losing out on it entirely."
