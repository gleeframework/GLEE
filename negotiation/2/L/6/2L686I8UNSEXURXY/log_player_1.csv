Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'll reject and counteroffer to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm counter-offering at $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob is clearly only willing to pay my minimum.  Since I can get the same price from John, I'm going to sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
