"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I place on the product.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,180,000. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1180000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not quite comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,200,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's a significant amount for me to give up. Let's see if we can finally make a deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
