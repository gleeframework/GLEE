Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $100, which I think is a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Since Bob values the product at $120, there's potential to earn more than your minimum ($80).
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum valuation. This presents a fair deal where both parties benefit.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims for a win-win scenario. If Bob accepts, you earn a good profit. If he rejects it, you still have a profitable sale with John."
