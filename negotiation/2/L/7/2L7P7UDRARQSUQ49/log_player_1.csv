Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal. I know I can always fall back on John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. It's still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my minimum price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge much.  It's getting too risky to keep negotiating with him, as I'm getting closer to my minimum price and John is a guaranteed sale."
