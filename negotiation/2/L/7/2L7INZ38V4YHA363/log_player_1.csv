"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit while leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is above my minimum, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my target.  I'm confident I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for Bob to compromise a bit further. I believe this offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and increasing the likelihood of a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer, and I risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting nothing."
