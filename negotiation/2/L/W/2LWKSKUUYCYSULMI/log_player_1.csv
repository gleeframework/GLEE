Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is highly unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's set a hard limit and signaled his willingness to walk away.  Selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 makes the most sense. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and the potential time pressure of the remaining rounds."
