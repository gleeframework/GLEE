"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it, considering its value to me. Let me know if you're open to negotiating at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a significant price reduction and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,700,000 is still outside of my comfort zone.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,500,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward with this deal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
