"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $1,050,000? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still providing you with a valuable product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This would be a fair price for me, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
