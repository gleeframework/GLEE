It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price, especially when you have a fallback option like buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 87.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $87.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for compromise, and I can always buy from John if I can't get a better price from Alice."
