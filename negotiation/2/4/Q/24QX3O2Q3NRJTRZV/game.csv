"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
