Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is right at the edge of what Alice is willing to accept. It shows that you're serious about getting a deal, but also acknowledges that her offer is getting closer to your target.  There's a good chance Alice will accept this counteroffer, but you're ready to walk away if she doesn't."
