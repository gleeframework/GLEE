"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to pay $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $130? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll agree.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $132. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at $132, I'll be happy to finalize the sale.",132.0,Alice,5,
