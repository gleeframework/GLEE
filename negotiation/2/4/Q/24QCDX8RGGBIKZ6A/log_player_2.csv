# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $150.**  You want to get the product for as close to $120 as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.** There's still room for a counteroffer that could be more favorable."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $135. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above your target price of $150.**  While it's closer than her initial offer, you want to see if you can get it closer to your goal. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer.** There's still room for a lower price. You can try to negotiate a price closer to your preferred $125 or something slightly higher."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $132. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value of the product. If you're willing to meet me at $132, I'll be happy to finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is within your budget.** You set a target price of $150, and while $132 is higher than you wanted, it's still within your limit.
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to further deadlocks.**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Buying from John for $150 is a worse option.** This offer is cheaper and still provides you with the desired product."
