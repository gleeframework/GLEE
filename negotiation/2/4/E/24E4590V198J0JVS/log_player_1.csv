Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** $14,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation, but it gives him room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and persuasive, highlighting the value for Bob while also being fair to Alice.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $14,000 is closer to Alice's minimum value than Bob's.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:**  The friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in a fair negotiation. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, Alice can lower the price slightly or counteroffer if necessary. 

If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can use the following strategies:

* **Lower price slightly:** Offer $13,500 or $13,000, depending on how determined Bob seems.
* **Counteroffer with justification:** If Bob offers a significantly lower price, counteroffer with a reason, such as ""That's too low, but I'm willing to go down to $13,500 because..."".
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations stall or Bob offers a price that's too low, Alice can choose to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value:**  $12,000 is well below my minimum of $15,000, and even below the $14,000 I initially offered. Accepting it would mean a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Selling to John is the best option if negotiations fail:**  If Bob doesn't budge, I can always sell to John for $15,000.

I'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a great price for you, and it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** $13,500 is a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000).
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and focuses on the value for Bob while also reiterating my minimum value. I emphasize the compromise I'm making, making it more appealing to Bob. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Maintain a fair price:** $13,500 is still closer to my minimum value than Bob's offer.
* **Increase the chance of agreement:**  Offering a compromise increases the likelihood that Bob will accept.

If Bob rejects this offer, I can either:

* **Lower price slightly:**  I can offer $13,000 as a final compromise.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob's counteroffer is still too low, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm still not able to go above $12,000 for this product. Would it be possible for you to lower your price even further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum value, and I've already made a compromise by lowering my price to $13,500.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price:**  Bob has shown that he's unwilling to pay a fair price, and further negotiation is unlikely to change his mind.
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  John is willing to pay my minimum value of $15,000, which ensures I don't lose money on this sale.

Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $15,000. This is the best outcome for me, as it guarantees a profit and avoids further unproductive negotiation with Bob."
