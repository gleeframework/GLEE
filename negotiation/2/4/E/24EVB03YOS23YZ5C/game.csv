,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is reflecting the true value of this product. I can be flexible, so how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise and allows us both to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
