"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",8200.0,Alice,5,
