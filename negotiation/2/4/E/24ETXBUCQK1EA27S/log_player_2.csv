# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique item.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk the negotiations failing."
