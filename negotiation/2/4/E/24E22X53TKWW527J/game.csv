"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8250. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $8000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8250 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8100 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8050, which is a fair price for both of us and within my range. Let's close this deal.",8050.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $8050, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8100. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable paying more than $8050.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at that price. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",8050.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your price of $8050, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $8150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8150.0,Alice,9,
