Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not ready to give up on my desired price just yet. I'd like to counteroffer at $720,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've chipped away at the price nicely and are now in a good bargaining position.  While we could try to negotiate further, accepting at $720,000 ensures we get the product at a significant saving compared to John's offer. It's always possible to get a lower price, but at this point, the risk of Alice walking away and the diminishing returns of further negotiation make accepting the deal the most logical choice."
