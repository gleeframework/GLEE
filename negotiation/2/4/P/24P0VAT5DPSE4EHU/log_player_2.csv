"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can likely negotiate a lower price.  There's no need to rush into accepting the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value it brings me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, as Alice is demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
