"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value it brings me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to pay closer to $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
