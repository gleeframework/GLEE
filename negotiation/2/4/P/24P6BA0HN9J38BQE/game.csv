"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $145? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget is tight, but $145 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $155? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $150. That's my absolute limit, but I'm really interested in this product.",150.0,Bob,4,
