"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $800000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial offer, and reflects my desire to work with you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1200000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you at $1400000. This is a fair price, considering the unique benefits it offers. Let's make this deal happen!",1400000.0,Alice,5,
