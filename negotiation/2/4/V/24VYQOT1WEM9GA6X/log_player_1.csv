Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving him a potential profit of $300,000 if he buys from you.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,000 (your minimum) and $1,500,000 (Bob's maximum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, being too greedy might make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting near the upper end of the ZOPA, aiming to capture a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Confidence:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you've set a strong initial price, there's some space for Bob to negotiate if he wishes, making a deal more likely.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is valuable, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price."
