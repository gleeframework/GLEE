"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle again at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I can offer it to you for $9,500, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but still a good compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
