"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $200 might be a bit high, but $80 is quite low for the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my absolute limit. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't let this go for less than $120. It's a final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my absolute final offer.  Let me know if it works for you.",110.0,Bob,6,
