"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a valuable investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still too far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would allow you to make a comfortable profit while still offering me a fair price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value. Let's try $920,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, which is a significant move for me, and I believe it gives you a healthy profit margin.  This feels like a good compromise that could benefit both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $905,000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.",905000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer you $895,000.  This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If we don't reach a deal here, I'll have to consider my other options.",895000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final concession, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is just $5,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",900000.0,Alice,9,
