"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely negotiate a better deal with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
