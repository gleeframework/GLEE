"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1200000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1350000?  That's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $1300000?  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a profit while still being within your budget.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I need you to come down further. Can you consider $1250000 again, or even $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
