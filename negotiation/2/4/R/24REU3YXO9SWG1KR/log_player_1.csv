Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I want to sell the product for as much as possible. 
* **Risk:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, but I have a guaranteed fallback price with John. 
* **Strategy:** I'm starting with an offer that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). This gives me room to potentially negotiate if Bob is interested but wants a lower price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer.  I will need to analyze Bob's response and potentially adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
