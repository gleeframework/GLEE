"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit stretched to pay $12000. Would you be willing to consider $11500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",11500.0,Bob,4,
