"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My initial offer is $950,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to secure this product for a bit less. Considering its value to me and your potential profit, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit considerably, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while giving you a solid profit. Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the product's full value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $890,000. This price allows for a good margin for both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with just a small adjustment.",890000.0,Alice,5,
