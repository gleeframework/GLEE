Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to secure this product for a bit less. Considering its value to me and your potential profit, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I know the product is worth to Bob. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit considerably, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me while giving you a solid profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I believe Bob is still willing to pay more, and I have several rounds left to reach a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the product's full value. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $890,000. This price allows for a good margin for both of us.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal with just a small adjustment."", ""product_price"": 890000}
