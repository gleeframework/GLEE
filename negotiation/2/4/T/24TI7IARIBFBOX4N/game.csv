"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1000000, and I'm willing to make a significant concession to make this deal happen.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and the value I bring to the table.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is the maximum I can afford. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and the value I'm bringing to the table.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach your budget limit, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $850000. I'm willing to make one final concession to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I bring to the table.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $800000. I've already made a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe this is the maximum I can afford. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product for $800000.",800000.0,Bob,6,
