"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your time. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to offer $10,000. I think it's a fair starting point for negotiation.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $17,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $12,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While $18,000 is still a stretch, I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a significant investment for me, so I need to be mindful of my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer again. However, $13,000 is still not close enough to my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $19,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.",19500.0,Alice,7,
