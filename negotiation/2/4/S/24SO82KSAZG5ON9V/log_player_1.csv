I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay. 

I'm also mindful of the fact that I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in offering a high price initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a slightly higher price. I'm hoping to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a successful deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a significant profit margin for me.  I believe this price is fair and attractive to Bob while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal.  The additional $100,000 is worth it to me to secure a sale.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but it's not worth the risk of Bob walking away."
