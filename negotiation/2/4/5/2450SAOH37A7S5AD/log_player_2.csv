"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $13,000.  I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is outside my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.
* **Realistic Expectations:**  I'm hoping to find a middle ground.  $8,500 is likely a price Alice would consider since it's closer to her perceived value of $10,000.
* **Setting the Stage:** By offering a price and a message, I'm establishing a clear starting point for negotiation and demonstrating a willingness to work towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I can't afford to pay that much and still achieve my goal of saving as much money as possible.  I need to keep negotiating to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still above what I can realistically afford. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant move towards Alice's offer, showing I'm serious about finding a middle ground.  It's also still within my budget constraints.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify my offer. This helps Alice see that I'm not just trying to get the lowest possible price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing ""compromise"" to keep the negotiation amicable and open to further discussion."
