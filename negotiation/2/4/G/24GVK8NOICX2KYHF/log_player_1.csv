"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open and Friendly:** My message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the discussion. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I want to get a good price but also avoid pushing Bob away too quickly. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always opt to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is higher, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob is firm on his offer, I can counter with a higher price and try to find a compromise. 
* **Selling to John is an option:**  If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for my minimum price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* I'll keep the possibility of selling to John in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a fair price considering the value I'm offering.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a higher price:** I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired range.
* **Highlight the value:** I reiterate the value of the product to emphasize why my price is justified.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I use phrases like ""willing to come down"" and ""find a solution"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to find a middle ground that balances my need for a good price and Bob's budget constraints.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to assess whether to lower my price further or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,000 is only $4,000 below my minimum price of $15,000.  
* **Good compromise:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and his offer is reasonable, given his budget constraints.
* **Time is of the essence:** With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.

**Strategy:**

* Accepting Bob's offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 
* Even though I'd prefer a higher price, I recognize the potential for the deal to fall apart if I continue to hold out."
