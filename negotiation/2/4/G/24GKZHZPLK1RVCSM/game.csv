"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant step towards your asking price, and a fair compromise for us both. Let's try to find common ground at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,150,000, which is $1,125,000. I think this price is a reasonable compromise that takes into account the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high. Let's aim for a final compromise of $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
