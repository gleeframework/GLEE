"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the potential for significant growth.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your maximum. You can do better by rejecting and seeing if she'll come down, or going with John."
