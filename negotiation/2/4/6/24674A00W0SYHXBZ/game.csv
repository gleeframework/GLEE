"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a good compromise. It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to recover most of my desired value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
