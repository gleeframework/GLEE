"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $137.50 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $115. It's a fair price for me, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still below my minimum.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,5,
