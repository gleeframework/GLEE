"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $13,000.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,200. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,200 is very close, but I'm aiming to stay under $11,000.  Would you consider $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,900 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,100. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.",11100.0,Alice,7,
