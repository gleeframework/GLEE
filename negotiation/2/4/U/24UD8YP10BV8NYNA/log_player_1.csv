Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still incentivize Bob to buy.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that price.

By offering the product at $11,500, Alice creates a win-win scenario where she earns significantly more than Bob values the product for, while Bob could still save $500 compared to Alice's alternative."
