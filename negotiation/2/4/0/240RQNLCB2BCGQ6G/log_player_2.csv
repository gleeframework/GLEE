"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still less than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the risk of a deal falling through."
