"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
