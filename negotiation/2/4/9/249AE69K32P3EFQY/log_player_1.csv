Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,900,000. I've already gone over my budget, and I'm not willing to exceed it. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is the highest price I can afford, and I hope you can understand my position.

At this point, Bob is unwilling to meet a price that's significantly higher than his perceived value of the product. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, continuing to negotiate with Bob has a low chance of yielding a better outcome. It makes the most sense to sell to John and avoid further haggling."
