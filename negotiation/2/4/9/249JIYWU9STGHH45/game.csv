"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to reach a deal.  However, I need to see a more realistic offer from you to continue this negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to reach a deal, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
