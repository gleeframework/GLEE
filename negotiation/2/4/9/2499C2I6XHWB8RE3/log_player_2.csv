# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I believe will be a great fit for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your understanding, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,550,000 is still within your budget and is closer to your desired price of $1,500,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there is a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer minimizes your risk and gets you the product you want at a reasonable price."
