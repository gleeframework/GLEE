"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. It's a fair price considering my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't even come close to covering my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it still leaves a good margin for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite there for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal. I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for your business, and this price reflects that potential.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I can offer $950,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",950000.0,Bob,6,
