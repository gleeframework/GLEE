# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can get the product for cheaper than $120, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can do $110, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

You're getting the product for $110, which is within your budget and still saves you money compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal!"
