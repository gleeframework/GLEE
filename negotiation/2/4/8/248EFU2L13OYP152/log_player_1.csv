Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,275,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
