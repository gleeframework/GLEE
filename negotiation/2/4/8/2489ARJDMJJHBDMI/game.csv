"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be satisfied with the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
