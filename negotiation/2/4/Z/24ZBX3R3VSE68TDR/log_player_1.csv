I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum threshold of $12,000.  I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

While I'm happy to get $12,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'm willing to accept $12,500 as it's higher than John's offer and still above my minimum threshold."
