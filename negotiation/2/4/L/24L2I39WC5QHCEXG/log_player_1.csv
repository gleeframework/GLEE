Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000, so I'll reject Bob's offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This aligns closely with the price offered by another seller, John. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's also the same price John is offering, so there's no need to risk further negotiations.  I'll accept his offer."
