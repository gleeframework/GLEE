"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
