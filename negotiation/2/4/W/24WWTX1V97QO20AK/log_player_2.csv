"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $2,250,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Bob can get a better deal, especially since Alice is willing to sell for a lower price ($1,500,000) than she is offering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price of $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000? This allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,850,000 is still well above Bob's budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get the price closer to his budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
