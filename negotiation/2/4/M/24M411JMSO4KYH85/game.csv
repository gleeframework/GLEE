"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  I'm starting at $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the sense we're not that far apart.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This would still give you a significant benefit over the market price, and it's a price I can comfortably accept.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced $1,300,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000. This is my final offer.",1220000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  We're getting close, but $1,220,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. This is a firm offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
