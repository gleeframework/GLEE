{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the product's value to me, and I believe I can get closer to my target price. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $750,000 is just too low. How about $850,000?  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a good starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my floor price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, I'm happy to accept this and move on to other opportunities."
