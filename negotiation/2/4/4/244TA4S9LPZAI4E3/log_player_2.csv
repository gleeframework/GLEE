# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I think you'll really benefit from having it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
