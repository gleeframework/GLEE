"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you.  While I agree that it's a great product and has potential value for me, I'm looking to acquire it for a price closer to $800,000. This would be a good starting point for us to explore a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still hoping to get the price closer to my initial offer of $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000? This would be a significant savings for me while still being a fair deal for you.  I believe this is a good compromise that would allow us to both move forward.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a significant profit for me, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,
