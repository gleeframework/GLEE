# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product with you.  While I agree that it's a great product and has potential value for me, I'm looking to acquire it for a price closer to $800,000. This would be a good starting point for us to explore a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
