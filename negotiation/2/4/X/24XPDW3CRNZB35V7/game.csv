"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. How about we try $92? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",92.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $88 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $90? It's getting close to my minimum, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
