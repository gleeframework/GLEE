{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering the product for $100, which is more than its value to Bob but less than my minimum desired price. This allows for some negotiation room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $85 is still below my minimum desired price of $120. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92.50 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88.75.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $88.75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired $120.  I'm confident I can get that price from John, so I'll choose to sell to him."
