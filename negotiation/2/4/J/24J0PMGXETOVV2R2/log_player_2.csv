"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it quite valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best to reject Alice's initial offer. While $1,250,000 isn't a terrible price, there's a good chance you can negotiate a lower price, closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?"",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Establish Interest:**  We don't want Alice to think we're not serious buyers.
* **Anchor a Lower Price:** $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  We're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle, ideally closer to our $1,000,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is significantly below my value. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice is negotiating, which is a good sign, but we're still a bit away from our ideal price.  It's worth seeing if we can get her a little closer to the $1,000,000 mark.  We're close enough that John's offer is a good backup plan if we can't make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet halfway at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate by moving closer to her price while still pushing for a better deal.
* **Simple Calculation:**  The ""meeting halfway"" approach is easy to understand and seems inherently fair.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We're keeping the negotiation active and moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice has met your ideal price. There's no point in rejecting this offer since you can buy it for the same price from John and it's unlikely Alice will go any lower."
