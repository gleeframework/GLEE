"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $140 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance she'll counter, giving us more room to work with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? That's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still $5 away from our ideal price and John's offer. Let's counter and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
``` 

We're proposing a price closer to our target while still leaving room for Alice to potentially counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $112 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. How about $118?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is down to $118, which is only $2 more than John's offer.  It's unlikely she'll come down further, and we risk losing out on the deal entirely if we push for those last few dollars.  Accepting at $118 is a good compromise."
