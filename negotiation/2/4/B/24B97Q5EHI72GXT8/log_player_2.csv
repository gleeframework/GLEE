"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above the product's value to her. You can likely get a better price by negotiating. You have some room to counteroffer before reaching your maximum price with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and still gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1080000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is a good deal for you. It's still within your budget and leaves some room for profit.  While you could potentially negotiate further, it's risky. Alice might not budge further, and you might end up buying from John at a higher price.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
