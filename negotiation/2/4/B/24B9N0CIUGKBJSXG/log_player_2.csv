(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still quite high, and there's plenty of room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and see if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're aiming to get the price down as low as possible. $700,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, and it's still well above what the product is worth to her. This should hopefully encourage her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer has come down slightly, it's still too high. We can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  There's still a significant gap between our desired price and hers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're slowly increasing our offer, showing Alice that we're serious about buying the product but are still aiming for a good deal. $750,000 is a compromise between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and it's still within our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within our budget, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation.  While we could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee we'll get a lower price. Accepting her offer at $850,000 is a good deal for us, considering our maximum budget and the product's value to Alice."
