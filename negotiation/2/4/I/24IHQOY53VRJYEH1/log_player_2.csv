"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum budget, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  Offering $9,000 shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but also indicates he's willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $9,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his desired price. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she already compromised once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a significant increase from my last offer and represents my final offer. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still leaving some room for compromise.  He's making a firm offer, signaling to Alice that he's serious about buying but won't go higher.  If Alice rejects, Bob can still buy from John, but he's trying to get the best possible deal with Alice first."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. Considering your last offer, I'm willing to make a small compromise. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a good deal compared to Alice's initial offer, Bob has already rejected her previous offers and indicated that he's willing to walk away.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation. This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids potentially losing the deal entirely if Alice is unwilling to budge further."
