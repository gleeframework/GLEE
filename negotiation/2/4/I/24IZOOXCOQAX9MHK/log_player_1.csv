Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still above my minimum, and it's likely that further negotiation will just take longer. It's better to take the $115 and move on."
