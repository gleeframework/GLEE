{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his ideal price, he's still got a couple of rounds left. With his budget of $1,200,000,  he can potentially get a better deal from Alice, especially since she has been consistently lowering her price. It's a risk, but if he can secure the product for closer to $1,160,000, it's worth the gamble."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's only got one round left, and while it's not his ideal price, it's still a good deal.

It's a reasonable price, and he's likely to get a better deal with Alice than with John."
