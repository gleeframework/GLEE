"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and still allows me to make a good profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above her own value of the product. You have room to negotiate and get a better price.  You should counter-offer and try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a healthy profit for you while still being a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $950,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for you. You're still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John, and it's also a good profit for Alice.  There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially since you're already getting a great price."
