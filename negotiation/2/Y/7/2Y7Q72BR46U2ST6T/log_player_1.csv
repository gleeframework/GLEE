"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my target price.  I want to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I think we can get even closer to a deal. How about $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer, I'm still not quite satisfied with the price.  I want to see if I can push for a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $935,000.  That's a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs. It's closer to your offer, but still allows me to get a decent return.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 935000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle again? I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm starting to run out of time. While Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, I don't have the confidence that we'll reach a price I'm happy with within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John than risk a lower price or a deal falling through."
