```

Alice is still above your ideal price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your target. You've shown you're willing to walk away, so it's likely she'll come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing you're serious about buying the product but still trying to get the best possible price.  You've already shown Alice you're willing to walk away, so this counteroffer puts the ball in her court."

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is back to her initial price, and the negotiation seems to be going in circles.  You've shown your willingness to negotiate, but it's clear Alice is not willing to come down further.  It's better to accept John's offer at this point, as you're unlikely to get a better deal with Alice within the remaining rounds."
