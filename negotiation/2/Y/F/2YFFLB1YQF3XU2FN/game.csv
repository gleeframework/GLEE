"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about $1,250,000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
