"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $100 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a good starting point for negotiation. It leaves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $150 maximum. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" we present ourselves as willing to compromise, which can encourage Alice to do the same."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is too low for me.  How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Alice is willing to move on her price, indicating room for further negotiation. 
* **Staying Below Maximum:**  While $115 is closer to our range, we can likely get a better deal.  Our goal is to maximize savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  I could do $105.  That seems fair, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Seeking Agreement:** By asking ""That seems fair, don't you think?"", we're subtly inviting Alice to agree and end the negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still below Alice's last offer but above our initial offer, aiming for a middle ground that benefits us."
