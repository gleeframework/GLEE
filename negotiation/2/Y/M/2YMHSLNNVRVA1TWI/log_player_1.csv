"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
