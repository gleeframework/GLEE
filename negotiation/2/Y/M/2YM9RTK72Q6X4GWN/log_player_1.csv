Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, by aiming high, we increase the potential for a larger profit. If Bob rejects the offer, we still have the safety net of selling to John for our minimum acceptable price."
