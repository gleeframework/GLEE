"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $800000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $900000, considering your interest and the product's potential value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider this compromise?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to be a bit higher.  How about $875000? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $875000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $850001, but no more. Can you meet me at this price?",850001.0,Bob,6,
