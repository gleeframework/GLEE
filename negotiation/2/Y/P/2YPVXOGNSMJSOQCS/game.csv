"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential,  $1,600,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for it. This reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1,450,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,525,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.",1525000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,525,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,500,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
