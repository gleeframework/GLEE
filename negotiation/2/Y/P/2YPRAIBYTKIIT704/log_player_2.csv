# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a discounted price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $9,500?  I know it's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
