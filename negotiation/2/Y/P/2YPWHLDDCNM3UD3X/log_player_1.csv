I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it, which is a significant amount and allows room for a profitable sale for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit below my target.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This would still be a significant profit for you, and I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset for me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.
