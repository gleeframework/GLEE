"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price for my investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it, which is a significant amount and allows room for a profitable sale for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset for me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum requirements.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
