"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price for my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $1,100,000, which is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it, which is a significant amount and allows room for a profitable sale for you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,050,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob can get the same product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset for me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,025,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, it makes sense to buy it from John and save $25,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will drop her price further, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of rounds and losing out on the opportunity to buy from John."
