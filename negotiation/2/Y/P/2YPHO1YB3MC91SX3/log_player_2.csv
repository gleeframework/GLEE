"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It is beneficial for Bob to reject the offer and counteroffer as he is willing to spend no more than $150 and this offer is above his budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $120.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Bob should reject the offer. While $120 is closer to his budget than the initial offer, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $120 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I'm really hoping to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
