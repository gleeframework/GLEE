"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9500.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,9800.0
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. It's a fair price, considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",9800.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,9500.0
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! Meeting in the middle was a great idea. However, I was thinking that $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle of the middle at $9,500? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, it seems like we're dancing around the same price. I'm willing to go up slightly to $8,750. Let me know if that works for you.",8750.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,9200.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,750, which is $8,875. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8875.0,Alice,7,,
