"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer, I'm still limited by my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant offer and represents a substantial compromise on my part.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we compromise at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,5,
