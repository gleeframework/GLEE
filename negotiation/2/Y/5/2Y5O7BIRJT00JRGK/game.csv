"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to come down to $900,000. This price still allows me to achieve a fair return while being competitive with your offer. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm going to make another offer.
