"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $9,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in that range?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our previous offers, which is $8,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're really close. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product.  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're really close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, $8,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",8500.0,Alice,7,
