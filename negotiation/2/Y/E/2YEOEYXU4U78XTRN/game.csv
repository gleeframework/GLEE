"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a nice product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $105 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $95 and we have a deal?",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $102? It's a slight compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",102.0,Alice,5,
