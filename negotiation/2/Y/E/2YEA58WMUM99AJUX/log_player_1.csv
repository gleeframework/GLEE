Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he'd potentially be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell to John for $8,000, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $12,000 gives you a significant profit margin while still leaving Bob with a potential surplus (the difference between his valuation and the price he pays).  

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
