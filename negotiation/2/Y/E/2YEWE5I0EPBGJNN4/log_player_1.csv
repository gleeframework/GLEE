Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Option:**  The offer is significantly higher than John's guaranteed purchase price ($1,000,000), ensuring you're covered if Bob declines.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might consider a slightly lower offer to increase the chance of acceptance.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a fairer price might be strategically beneficial.

**Remember:** This is just one possible strategy. The best approach depends on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob's negotiation style."
