"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,000? This would still give you a great deal, and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $11,750? It's a fair compromise, and still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this!",11750.0,Alice,5,
