"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He has 10 rounds, and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. He's already shown a willingness to pay slightly more than John's price, so Alice may be willing to come down a bit more.  Plus, with 7 rounds left, he has time to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on.  Let's see if we can close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's already gotten Alice down to $11,000, and he has several rounds left to negotiate. There's a good chance he can get her closer to his target of $10,500 or even lower, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $10,000 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference again and go with $10,875. I think this is a fair price that we can both agree on and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,875 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $10,937.50. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,937.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,937.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten her down to a price just above his target of $10,500, and with only three rounds left, he's unlikely to get a significantly better deal.  It's important to remember that Bob has a safety net with John, so if he does decide to reject Alice's offer, he can still get the product for $10,000. However, accepting Alice's offer is the more strategic move in this scenario."
