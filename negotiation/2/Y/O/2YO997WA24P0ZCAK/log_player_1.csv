``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** I'm expressing confidence in the product's value to Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance. 
* **Leaving Room:** I'm not starting too high, as I don't want to scare Bob off immediately. I'm hoping for a few rounds of negotiation to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider making a counteroffer or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Improvement:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown a willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet. There's a chance I can secure a better deal with him.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap between our positions. 
* **Monitoring Progress:** I'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust my strategy based on his willingness to compromise. 
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm still aiming for a better price from Bob."
