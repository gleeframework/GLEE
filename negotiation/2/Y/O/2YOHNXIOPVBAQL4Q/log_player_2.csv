"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. My initial offer for the product is $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  While it's a good starting point, you're looking to save as much money as possible. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate.**  By rejecting, you can try to get a better price from Alice. 
* **You have 10 rounds.**  This gives you ample time to negotiate and potentially find a price you're happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a significant drop:**  A $150,000 decrease shows you're serious about saving money and sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Stay within your budget:** This offer is well below your maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Be polite and positive:** A friendly tone encourages a cooperative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,250,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.** You are aiming to save as much as possible and $1,250,000 is still a considerable amount over your desired price point.
* **Continuing negotiation is beneficial.** By rejecting this offer, you can continue to push for a lower price and potentially reach a deal that is more advantageous to you.
* **You have 7 rounds left.**  This provides ample time to negotiate and potentially find a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I can stay within my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant counteroffer:** Offering $1,200,000 shows you're serious about getting a good price but are also willing to compromise.
* **Focus on fairness:** Highlighting the ""fair"" aspect for both parties can help Alice see the value in your offer.
* **Keep the tone positive:** Staying friendly and encouraging collaboration can make Alice more receptive."
