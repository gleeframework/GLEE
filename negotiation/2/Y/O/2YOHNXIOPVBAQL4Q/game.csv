"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,150,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm still a bit above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while I can stay within my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
