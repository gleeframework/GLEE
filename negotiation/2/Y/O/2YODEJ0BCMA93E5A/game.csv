"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm closer to your offer now, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000.  If we can find a compromise at that level, I'm ready to make a deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to meeting your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $12,000 to justify the sale. I'm counteroffering at $11,500 is too low, so I'm going to try to meet you in the middle again. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal.",11250.0,Alice,5,
