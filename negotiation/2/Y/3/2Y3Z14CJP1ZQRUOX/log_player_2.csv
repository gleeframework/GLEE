"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $125.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
