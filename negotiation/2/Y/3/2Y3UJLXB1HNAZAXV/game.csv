"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $155. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $155. Would you be willing to consider $145? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $152 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $150? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a decision today if we can meet in the middle.",150.0,Bob,6,
