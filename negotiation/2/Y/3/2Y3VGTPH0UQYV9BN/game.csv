"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for both parties.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $10,500, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $10,700. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",10700.0,Alice,5,
