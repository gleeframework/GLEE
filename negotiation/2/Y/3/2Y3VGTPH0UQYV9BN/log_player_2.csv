Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get the price down to $10,500."
