Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which is $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and while we could likely negotiate a bit further, the potential savings are getting smaller.  $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering John's fallback price of $1,500,000."
