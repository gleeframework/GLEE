"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1000000. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this product and be willing to meet me at a mutually beneficial price. Let's get started! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to my initial price. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and while this offer is closer to his target, it's still not ideal. Continuing the negotiation allows Bob to potentially push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to land a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair compromise and a significant step towards finalizing this sale.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which is $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that the negotiations could break down and Bob might not be able to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with.  

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John at $800,000. This guarantees him the product at a price that fits within his budget and ensures a successful transaction."
