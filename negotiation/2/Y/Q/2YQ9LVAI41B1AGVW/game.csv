"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is my best offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,000 is cutting it too close. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This is my final offer.",8500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm on a tight budget.  I could do $7,500, but that's really as high as I can go.",7500.0,Bob,6,
