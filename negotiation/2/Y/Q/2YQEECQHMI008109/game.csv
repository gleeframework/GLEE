"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $20,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $20,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",17500.0,Bob,4,
