"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $14,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's best to reject Alice's initial offer. It's too close to your maximum budget, leaving little room for negotiation. You should aim to get the price closer to Alice's value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her perceived value of the product. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling your interest in a fair deal.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Expressing Budget Concerns:**  By mentioning the price is ""a bit high,"" you subtly introduce the idea of budget limitations without fully revealing your hand."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you do $13,750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above a reasonable target.  We need to continue negotiating to get closer to a price that benefits both of us.  We're not in a rush, so there's no need to jump to John's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4

{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic â€“ finding a middle ground. It shows a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to your desired price range.
* **Simple and Direct:**  Keeps the negotiation moving without overcomplicating things.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  ""Meeting in the middle"" implies a mutually beneficial outcome."
