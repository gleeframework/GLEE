"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and offers immense value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** $10,500 is within Bob's budget and is a good deal considering the product's value to him.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has shown willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Risk of Buying from John:** Buying from John for $12,000 is riskier, as there's no chance to negotiate a lower price.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a decent deal while saving $1,500 compared to John's offer."
