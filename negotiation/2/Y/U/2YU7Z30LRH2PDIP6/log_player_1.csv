Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value to you, I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm starting at $1,400,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,400,000 is a good starting point, as it's a significant amount above my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better chance of securing a higher price.
* **Focus on Value:** My message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making him more likely to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've made it clear I'm open to negotiation, making Bob feel like he has some control in the process. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If he seems hesitant or unreasonable, I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,200,000, guaranteeing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 to see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for him. I'm willing to negotiate further but I believe I can secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, starting at a price closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000. I'll also reiterate the value of the product to him and show a willingness to compromise.  If he remains stubborn, I can always opt to sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your offer, I believe the product's value to you warrants a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's exceptional qualities and allows us to both benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my initial offer and Bob's proposal. This shows a willingness to work together and reach an agreement.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, reminding him of its worth and justifying my higher price.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the negotiation as a mutually beneficial transaction, highlighting that a higher price is good for both of us.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and consider whether to further adjust my price or accept his offer. If he rejects again, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. I believe $1,325,000 is a reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is now very close to my initial counteroffer of $1,350,000.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether.  It's important to balance getting the best price with the possibility of losing a sale. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. It's a good outcome, as it's above my minimum price and a reasonable compromise given Bob's initial resistance."
