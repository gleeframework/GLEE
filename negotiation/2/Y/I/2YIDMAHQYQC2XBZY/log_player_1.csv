Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think it would be very valuable for you, and this is a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price point that is:
    * Above your minimum ($100)
    * Potentially attractive to Bob (as it's slightly less than $100)
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this example doesn't include back-and-forth negotiation, setting the initial price at $95 leaves you some wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer."
