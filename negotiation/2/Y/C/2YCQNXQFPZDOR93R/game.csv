"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $170 is a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and I pay $140?  I'm really keen on getting this product, so let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that works for you!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's meet in the middle again.  How about $145? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $145 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $152. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if that works for you!",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $152 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $148. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach an agreement.  What do you say?",148.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $148 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $150.50. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me halfway this time.",150.5,Alice,7,
