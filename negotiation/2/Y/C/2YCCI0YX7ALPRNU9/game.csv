"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still confident in the true value of this product.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $1,100,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position on the budget, but I believe this product's potential ROI for you justifies a higher investment.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This price reflects a significant move on my end while recognizing the value you'll gain.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,050,000? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. I value your persistence, and to show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'll come down to $1,150,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
