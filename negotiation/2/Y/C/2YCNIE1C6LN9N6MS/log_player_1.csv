Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to negotiate down, and I'm confident he'll want to make a deal given the product's worth to him.
* **Setting a Clear Expectation:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't go too low. 

This approach gives me the best chance of getting a good price while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob. He's already shown interest, and the product is worth more to him. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will send a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to see how committed Bob is to the deal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation and hopefully secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,250,000 represents a compromise.  It's significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's also lower than my initial price.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided Bob with a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's too far below my minimum acceptable price. 

This counteroffer maintains a strong negotiating position while leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  He's already shown some resistance. 
* **Potential for More:** While I'd prefer a higher price, there's a good chance I could find another buyer willing to pay closer to my initial asking price if this deal falls through.

Considering the risk of losing Bob and the fact that I'm already close to my minimum price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision."
