{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum value:** You're aiming for more than $10,000, which is your minimum.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  You don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price if Bob counteroffers. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I'm not going to accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $9,500 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,750? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great product."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. Accepting this offer would be a good outcome, and it's important to remember that negotiations are about finding a mutually agreeable price."
