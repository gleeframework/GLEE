"Bob, I understand you're looking to save, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a significant amount, and I'm confident it will bring substantial value to you. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing you to make a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
