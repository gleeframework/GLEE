"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your company. My initial offer is $1,400,000. This price reflects the significant value and potential of this product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's desired price range. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my desired value for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation could potentially achieve a slightly lower price, it's risky, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget with minimal risk."
