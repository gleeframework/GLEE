"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's tempting to grab a deal close to my maximum, I'm determined to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows me to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my ideal range.  I want to see if I can push her lower. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $975,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $975,000 is cutting it too close. This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and its value is reflected in my pricing.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer.
