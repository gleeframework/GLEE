"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your time, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $14,500 is still too low for me, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14250. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $14,250 is still too far below my minimum, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $15,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $14,250 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair compromise.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 6

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $14,750 is still not high enough for me, and I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John either, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $14,750 just isn't enough for me. I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $15,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this round."", ""product_price"": 15500}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14875. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, we're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still too low.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum, and it's better than risking a further price drop from Bob."
