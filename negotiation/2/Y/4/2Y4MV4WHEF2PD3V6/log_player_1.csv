"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a healthy profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate, but I'm confident he'll be motivated to make a deal given the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000.  I believe this is still a fair price, given the product's value to Bob, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this counteroffer will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push him up just a bit more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, showing my willingness to compromise. With only 5 rounds left, I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly lower than John's offer just yet. There are still a few rounds left to negotiate, and I'm hoping I can get a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $1,025,000. We're down to the wire now, and I need to be realistic.  This is still a good profit, but it's a compromise.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, it's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further, and I'm not comfortable accepting a price that's significantly lower than John's offer.  While it's not my ideal scenario, selling to John guarantees me a safe and reasonable profit."
