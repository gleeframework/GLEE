Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is getting closer to your maximum, but it's still higher than what John is offering. Since you are trying to save as much money as possible, it's more advantageous to go with John's offer and buy the product for $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of going back and forth without a guaranteed lower price."
