"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it,  which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some further research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,600,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000.  I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
