"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. How about $1,150,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product and the savings you'll get.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $1,080,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1,080,000 is still too far below what I'm aiming for. Let's meet halfway, at $1,115,000.  I believe this price is fair for both of us.",1115000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,115,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $1,080,000, but I'm not flexible beyond that. Can you consider that?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
