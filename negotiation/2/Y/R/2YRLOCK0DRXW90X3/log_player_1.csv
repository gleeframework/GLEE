Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, which is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to maximize your profit, so aiming slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases your chances of a sale while still securing a significant profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the slightly lower price point might encourage Bob to accept immediately without further negotiation."
