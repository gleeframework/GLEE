"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and John's offer leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value in your eyes. 
* **Anchoring:**  By setting a high anchor price, you influence Bob's perception of the product's worth, potentially leading him to make a counteroffer closer to your desired range. 
* **Information Gathering:** This first offer is also about gauging Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will provide valuable insights into his negotiation style and how badly he wants the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than your minimum acceptable price.  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's serious and willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. You have room to work with and time to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is substantial. Let's find a middle ground. I propose a revised price of $2,100,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down in price, but not drastically. A $150,000 decrease shows flexibility while still reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere between his offer and our previous price, encouraging him to reciprocate with a move closer to our target.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's worth, we're subtly reminding Bob why he's interested and anchoring the negotiation around its value, not just the price tag."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, but we're not there yet. He's increased his offer, showing continued interest. It's worth pushing a bit further, especially since we have rounds to spare and a guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize we're getting closer to a deal. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer reflects the very edge of what I can accept while acknowledging your interest.  Let me know if we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm, but Fair:** We're making another significant concession to signal we're serious about closing a deal with Bob.  However, we're holding firm at $2,000,000, which is still a substantial profit above our minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a level of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Clear Choice:**  This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He now has to decide if the product is worth the $2,000,000 price tag, knowing this is likely the best offer he'll get from us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm getting closer to accepting, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market and the benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,950,000 is a significant profit, exceeding your $1,500,000 minimum by a healthy margin.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While you could try to push for more, Bob is clearly demonstrating price sensitivity around this range.  Further haggling might only yield small increases, with the risk of him walking away entirely.
* **Time Value:**  Securing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations and allows you to allocate your time and resources elsewhere."
