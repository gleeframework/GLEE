Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but lower than my minimum of $150. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving a decent profit.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message explicitly states I'm open to negotiation, which might make Bob more likely to counteroffer instead of outright rejecting.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's also well below my initial offer of $130, indicating he's not serious about a fair negotiation.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $150 is a much better deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing that opportunity for a significantly lower price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I will counteroffer Bob, but I need to be careful not to drop too low too quickly.

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is still above my minimum, but closer to his offer to see if we can find common ground. If he continues to lowball, I will likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** I'm counter-offering Bob with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum price of $150. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains my value.
* **Friendly tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation amicable and prevents it from becoming adversarial.
* **Reasoning for the price:** I'm providing a reason for my price, highlighting the value of the product to hopefully sway Bob's opinion.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a sale at a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.
* If Bob doesn't counteroffer, I will likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, maybe around $80? That's the absolute highest I could go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John.  It's clear that Bob is trying to exploit my need to sell the product and is not serious about paying a fair price.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob will only waste my time. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.

**Next steps:**

* I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
