"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're offering is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
