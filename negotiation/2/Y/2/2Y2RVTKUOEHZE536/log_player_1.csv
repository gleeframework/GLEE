**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($800,000).  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and continuing the negotiation risks getting a worse offer or running out of rounds. Accepting John's offer is the safe and logical choice to secure the minimum desired profit."
