"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have to say that $800000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable price.

"I'm surprised you're not willing to meet me at $795000, Alice. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm sticking to my original counteroffer of $795000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",795000.0,Bob,8,
