"Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer. He can counter-offer at a lower price, potentially getting a better deal than $13,000. While John offers the product for $15,000, negotiating with Alice has the potential to save Bob even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Even though the difference is smaller, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is not the best option right now as it's more expensive."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's desired price point.  It's only $150 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  Further negotiation might get a better price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob losing out to John increases.  It's a good balance of saving money while minimizing risk."
