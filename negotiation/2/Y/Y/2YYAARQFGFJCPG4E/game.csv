"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? ",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little.  That being said, $1,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable going.  Could you meet me closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700,000 simply won't work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This gives you a great price for the product while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
