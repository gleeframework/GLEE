{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's high enough to potentially leave room for negotiation but still provides a good profit for me. I'm also leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob. If he rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John if the price isn't good enough for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet somewhere in the middle?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, $600,000 is not a price I can accept. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me a little.  That being said, $1,000,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable going.  Could you meet me closer to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While I am willing to negotiate, $700,000 is still far too low for me. I need to get closer to my asking price. I will make another counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700,000 simply won't work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This gives you a great price for the product while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
