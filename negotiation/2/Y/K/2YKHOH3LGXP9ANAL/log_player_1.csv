Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob the product at a price of $90. I'm hoping to earn a good profit, but I'm not too greedy, so I'm willing to make a reasonable offer.

{""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer, I'm not thrilled about it, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I think I can accept Bob's offer and earn a decent profit.
