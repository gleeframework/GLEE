Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
