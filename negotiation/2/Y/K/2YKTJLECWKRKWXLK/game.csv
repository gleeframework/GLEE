"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value of $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it would be a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,750 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,625?  This would still allow you to make a decent profit, and it would be a fair price for me.  What do you think?",10625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,625. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about we meet at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise for me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
