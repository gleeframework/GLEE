This is a much higher price than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."

Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still too high. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."

While $10,250 is closer to your budget, it's still more than what you are willing to pay. At this point, it's better to just buy the product from John for $8,000."
