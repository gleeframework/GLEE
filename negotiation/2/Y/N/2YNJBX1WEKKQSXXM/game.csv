"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $825,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $700,000.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $800,000. This is already the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for the product's value. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
