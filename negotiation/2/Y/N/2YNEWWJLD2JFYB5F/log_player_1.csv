Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
