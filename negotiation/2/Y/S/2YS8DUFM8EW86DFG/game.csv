"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $775000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm proposing a new price of $800000, which is still a compromise, but one that reflects the product's value and my initial offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust your price, but I'm still not convinced that $800000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775000 and $800000, so I'm proposing a new price of $787500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",787500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $787500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a new price of $795000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",795000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $795000. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm proposing a new price of $780000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",780000.0,Bob,8,
