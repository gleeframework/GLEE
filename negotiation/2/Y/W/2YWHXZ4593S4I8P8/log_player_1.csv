Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for the absolute maximum price right away.  This allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations to occur.
* **Knowing My Back-up:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $11,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a compromise.
* **John is a Backup:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? This feels more fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 11750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Price:** I'm offering $11,750, which is in the middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Positive and Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping a positive and friendly tone, reinforcing the idea of finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to meet me closer to my desired price.
* **Leaving Room for One More Negotiation:** I'm not aiming for the absolute maximum yet, hoping to reach an agreement with Bob on this second counteroffer. If not, I can still sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $11,750 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $11,000, which would be $10,750. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $10,750 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I am not willing to go that low.
* **No Further Negotiation:**  I've already made two counteroffers and haven't seen much movement from Bob.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult and time-consuming.
* **John Offers a Secure Option:**  I can sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum and guarantees me a good profit.  It's a more reliable and less stressful option than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
