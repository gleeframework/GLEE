"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit below my minimum. How about we split the difference and go with $11,750? This feels more fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $11,750 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $11,000, which would be $10,750. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10750.0,Bob,4,
