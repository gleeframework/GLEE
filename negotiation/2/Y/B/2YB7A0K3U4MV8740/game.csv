"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Could we agree on $11,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. My final offer is $12,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
