Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to $14,500 - $14,750.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefit for both of us, making it sound like a fair deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly open to negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.
* If the negotiation drags on or I feel like I won't get a good price, I'll sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to take such a big loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  He's clearly interested in the product, and I can potentially get a higher price with a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000, which is a more acceptable outcome than accepting Bob's current offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to meet him halfway but still securing a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $11,000 is lower than I expected, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  This would still be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** I'm offering $12,500, which is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining profit:** This price still allows me to make a profit, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" for both of us to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $12,000? That would be a great price for me, and I think it's still a fair deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to keep negotiating and risk losing this deal.
* **No further upside:**  I'm not likely to get a better offer from Bob, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or him walking away.
* **John's offer:**  While John is also offering $12,000, there's no guarantee that the deal with John will go through without any issues.  Bob has already shown interest and is now offering my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. This ensures I get my minimum desired price without the risk of further negotiation."
