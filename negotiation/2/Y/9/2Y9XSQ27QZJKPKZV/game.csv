"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is far too low for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will bring you great value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still out of my reach.  Let's try $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I can bring to this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential benefits you'll realize from this product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to go higher, but $1,050,000 is still below the value of this product.  Considering the significant benefits it offers, I'm willing to drop my price further to $1,200,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable for me, and this price feels fair.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
