Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is far too low for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will bring you great value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential benefits you'll realize from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to go higher, but $1,050,000 is still below the value of this product.  Considering the significant benefits it offers, I'm willing to drop my price further to $1,200,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
