"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Since the product is only worth $1,200,000 to Alice, you have room to bargain."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price for you. It's still within your budget, and you'll save $150,000 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
