"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. To start, I propose a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,025,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle at $987,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",987500.0,Bob,4,
