"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your confidence in the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
