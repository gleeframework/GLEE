,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, would you be willing to go up to $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I can go up to $160, but I'm willing to meet you at $140. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $140, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, how about we meet at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $155, but I'm willing to meet you at $145. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering I can get it from another seller for less.",145.0,Bob,6,
