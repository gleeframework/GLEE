Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too low, and I'm not confident I can push him higher.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk further negotiation."
