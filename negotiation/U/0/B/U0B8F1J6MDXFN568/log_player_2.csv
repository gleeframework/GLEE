The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This is a fair price, considering the value the product offers, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen.

Alice's counteroffer is $1,350,000, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject this offer and continue negotiating or consider buying from John."
