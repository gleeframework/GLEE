Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, he's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It makes more financial sense to cut negotiations with Bob and sell to John."
