{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** This ensures you're getting a good deal while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and potentially accept. 
* **It's a strong initial offer:** This sets the tone for the negotiation and shows you're confident in the value of the product. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000. This would still be a significant profit for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still below your initial desired profit.  You have more room to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance you can get a higher price. You're also not desperate to sell, so you can afford to be more strategic in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves plenty of room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows you're willing to negotiate:** You're not sticking to your initial price, but you're also not accepting Bob's low offer.
* **Is still a good profit for you:** $1,000,000 is well above your minimum and represents a significant gain.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  It's a reasonable compromise that signals your willingness to find a solution, but it also leaves space for Bob to potentially counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to your desired profit, it's still not at the level you're hoping for. You're not desperate to sell and can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:** You're demonstrating that you're willing to meet Bob halfway, but still asserting your value.
* **Is a reasonable compromise:**  $975,000 is a  smaller gap between your last offer and Bob's, making it a likely point of agreement. 
* **Leaves a small amount of room for negotiation:** While it's close to your target, it's not your final price, allowing for potential adjustments if Bob makes a final counteroffer."
