"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go as low as your offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
