Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  That's still a little rich for me though. How about $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go beyond $1,000,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get him significantly closer to my desired price. Selling to John guarantees I receive my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale."
