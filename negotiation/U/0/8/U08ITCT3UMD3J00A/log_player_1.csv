Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential negotiation without dropping below your desired minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This avoids confusion and sets the stage for a clear negotiation. 

If Bob rejects, you can then assess the situation and potentially adjust your offer based on his counteroffer, or choose to sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your willingness to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Moves closer to Bob's offer:** It shows willingness to negotiate and compromise.
* **Keeps a significant gap:** It leaves room for further negotiation and prevents a quick close at a lower price.
* **Maintains a positive tone:** It emphasizes the value for Bob, keeping the conversation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for your product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is only $25,000 away from my counteroffer. It's getting close to my minimum, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and unproductive.  It's a good deal considering that selling to John guarantees $1,500,000 but takes away the opportunity for a potential higher profit."
