Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $1,100,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him entirely."
