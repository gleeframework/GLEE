Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a reasonable starting point as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that I'm willing to pay, as it's within my budget."
