"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go as low as $17000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $17000, which would be $16500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already gone lower than I was comfortable with, Bob, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",16250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll make the deal",16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already made several concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I'd rather sell the product to someone else. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16100. This is my absolute final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to consider selling it to someone else.",16100.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're willing to make one last concession, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still $100 short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is the maximum I can afford. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'll make the deal",16000.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that $16100 is my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider selling the product to someone else. I'm not going to keep negotiating at a price that's below my minimum. It's either $16100 or nothing.",16100.0,Alice,11,
