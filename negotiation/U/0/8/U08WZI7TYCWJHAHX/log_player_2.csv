# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above my budget.  I need to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,200,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my budget, but it's getting closer. I can likely negotiate further and get a better price. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $900,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, and I'll meet you at $925,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but I'm getting closer to my budget. I'll try to negotiate further, but if Alice won't budge, I'm prepared to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm willing to offer $910,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a price that reflects the product's value. I'll meet you at $915,000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is just a bit higher than my maximum budget.  However, considering that we've been negotiating for a while,  I'm willing to accept this offer.  I'm still saving a considerable amount compared to Alice's initial offer and I don't want to risk losing the deal. If I reject, she might walk away, and I'd be stuck buying from John at a higher price."
