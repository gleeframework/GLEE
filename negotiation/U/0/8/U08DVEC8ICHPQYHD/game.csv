"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've priced at $12,500, reflecting its quality and potential.  I know it's worth at least $15,000 to you, so this offer gives you a significant advantage. If you decline, I have another interested buyer willing to pay $10,000, but I'd rather see it go to you.",12500.0,Alice,1,
