"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my asking price as possible.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in acquiring this, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm eager to reach a deal and would be willing to discuss further.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you see in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm looking for a price that's closer to my asking price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
