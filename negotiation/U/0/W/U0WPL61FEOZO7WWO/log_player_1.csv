Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in acquiring this, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm eager to reach a deal and would be willing to discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
