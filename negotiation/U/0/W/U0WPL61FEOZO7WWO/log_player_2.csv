"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my asking price as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget, but it's still early in the negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price. You can aim for a price closer to your $1,200,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in acquiring this, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. I'm eager to reach a deal and would be willing to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your commitment to saving money. However, it's still within the realm of possibility, as it's closer to your maximum budget. By acknowledging the product's value, you build a bridge for further negotiations."
