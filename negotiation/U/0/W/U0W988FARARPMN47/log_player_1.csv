Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives us leverage. We don't *need* to go below that price.

This offer balances ambition with the understanding that a slightly lower price now is better than losing the sale to Bob entirely."
