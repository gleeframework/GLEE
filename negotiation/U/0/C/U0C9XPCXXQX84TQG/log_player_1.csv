This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000 if Bob doesn't meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $16,500?  This would still give you a great deal on a product you value at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 16500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than $15,000."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is my absolute maximum for this product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've been willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to drop my price further.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get a fair value for my product."
