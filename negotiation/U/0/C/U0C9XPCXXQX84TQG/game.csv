,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price. How about $16,500?  This would still give you a great deal on a product you value at $15,000.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $14,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $14,500? This is a fair price, and it allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good value on this product.",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is my absolute maximum for this product. Can you meet me at this price?",13500.0,Bob,6,
