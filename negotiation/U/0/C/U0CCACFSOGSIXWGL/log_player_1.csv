Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed $80 from John allows you to aim higher with Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
