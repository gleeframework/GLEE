"I understand you're trying to balance the price with your budget, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm still not getting close enough to my minimum. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary service package. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality product.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product, and I'd like to discuss the possibility of including some of the extras in the deal at a lower price point. I'm open to negotiating the terms of the extras, but I need to stay within my budget.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate the extras, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. However, I'm willing to compromise on the extras. I'll include the 5-year warranty, but I'll remove the complimentary service package. I'll also throw in a 10% discount on the product price, which brings it down to $1025000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product and the warranty.",1025000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $1025000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1012500 for the product, which includes the 5-year warranty. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
