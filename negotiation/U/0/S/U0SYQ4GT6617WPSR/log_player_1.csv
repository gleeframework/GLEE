Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and my offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price. This gives you leverage with Bob. You can aim for a price higher than Bob's valuation, knowing you have John as a safety net. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Negotiable Price:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than your guaranteed price from John.  
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 
* **Positive Language:** Framing the offer in terms of ""value"" and ""potential"" helps justify the high price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

1. **Bob Accepts:** You get $1,250,000 â€“ a great deal exceeding his valuation and surpassing what John would pay.
2. **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down to $1,500,000 while still meeting your minimum. 
3. **Bob Rejects:** No problem! You sell to John for your guaranteed $1,500,000.

**Important:** This is just one possible strategy.  You could experiment with different prices and messaging to see how Bob responds."
