Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be prepared to negotiate but will keep in mind my minimum of $150 and the potential sale to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $150.  I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming for something closer to my desired price point.  If he won't budge, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  $145 is closer to my minimum of $150 and still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $150,  Bob isn't budging much further, and I'm getting close to my minimum.  Selling to John guarantees me a safe profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
