"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product,  $1500000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1100000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1300000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
