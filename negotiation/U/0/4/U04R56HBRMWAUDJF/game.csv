"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $115 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $108 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $112?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find the product very valuable.",112.0,Alice,5,
