"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. $110 is below my minimum price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $115 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $115. How about $108? I'm trying to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm going to stick to my guns and try to get a better deal.  I'm not willing to give up on the negotiation just yet.  I think I can still secure a better price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, $108 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $112?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still find the product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $112. How about $109? I'm trying to stay within my budget and feel that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $109
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $109 is closer to my minimum price of $120, I'm still going to reject the offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to sell the product below my desired price.  I'm going to continue trying to get a better price for the product."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of time here, so let's try to find a solution. I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We're down to the last few rounds, and I'm not sure I can get Bob to go any higher.  While I'd prefer to get more, $120 is still a good price, and it's important to secure a deal."
