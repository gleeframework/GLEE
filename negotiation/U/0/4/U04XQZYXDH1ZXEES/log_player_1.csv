"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob, giving us a chance to find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, aiming for a price that is closer to my desired value.  I'm hopeful that I can get him to agree on a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $92.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
