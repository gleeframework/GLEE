"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($900,000 vs. $800,000), but still significantly lower than your maximum value ($1,200,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  By offering $750,000, I'm starting with a lower price than Alice's offer, showing that I'm serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer gives Alice some room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message emphasizes finding a price that works for both of us, creating a more collaborative negotiation atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $800,000. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum value, I'm still looking to save as much as possible.  I believe there's room to negotiate further, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is closer to your minimum.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement at that price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Alice's minimum:** My counteroffer meets Alice's minimum, demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching a deal and understand her constraints.
* **Stronger negotiation position:** By offering her minimum price, I put the pressure on Alice to accept. If she wants to keep negotiating, she'll have to offer a lower price.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** The message conveys a willingness to find a solution while acknowledging Alice's needs."
