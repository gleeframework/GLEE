Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice is unwilling to budge below $10,000 and has labeled it her final offer. Since you can get the product for $10,000 from John, there's no point in further negotiation."
