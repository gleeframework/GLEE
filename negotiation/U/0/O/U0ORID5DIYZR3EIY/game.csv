"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18000 is higher than I'm willing to go. I'm very interested in this product, though. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? That's my maximum budget for this purchase.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16000 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $14000? It's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go at this point.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is your absolute highest offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $15500 is closer, but I'm still at my limit. If you could come down to $14500, I'd be happy to accept. This is truly my final offer.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to accept $14500. I'll make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $15250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,7,
