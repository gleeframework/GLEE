"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer, coming down from Alice's initial price by $1,000. This shows good faith while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still quite attached to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is close to Bob's counteroffer of $13,000. It's a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price and still within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
