"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value proposition.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but  $1,600,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, which I believe is a fair price for the product. Can we meet at this price?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
