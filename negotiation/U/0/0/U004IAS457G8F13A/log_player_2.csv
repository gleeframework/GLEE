"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets a strong negotiating position and encourages Alice to consider a compromise.
* **Fairness:**  $7,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still staying within Bob's budget.
* **Message Tone:**  Bob's message is polite and emphasizes his willingness to negotiate, creating a positive atmosphere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  He's aiming to save as much as possible, and there's still room for further negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $8,500 is getting closer, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,250?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```
