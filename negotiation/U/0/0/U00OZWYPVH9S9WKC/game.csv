"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still not quite there at $100.  Would you consider $90?  That's a fair price for both of us and would let me move forward with the purchase.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $95. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",95.0,Alice,5,
