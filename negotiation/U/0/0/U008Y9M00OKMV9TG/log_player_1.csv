Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive to Bob while maximizing your profit. Here's the approach:

1. **Start High, But Reasonable:**  Don't start at $1,500,000. This immediately signals you have another buyer and limits negotiation.  Begin slightly below your minimum, aiming to create the perception of a deal for Bob.

2. **Justification:** Offer a brief, plausible reason for the price. This makes it seem less arbitrary.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name] ahead of other interested parties.  Given the unique value and current market demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. This reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **""Interested parties"":**  Subtly implies competition.
* **""Unique value"" and ""market demand"":** Adds perceived value.
* **""Initially proposing"":**  Signals room for negotiation.
* **""Significant return on investment"":** Focuses on Bob's potential benefit. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide to negotiate further down towards his $1,200,000 limit, knowing you have John's offer as a safety net."
