"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet halfway at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,800,000 is beyond my budget. Could we perhaps aim for $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
