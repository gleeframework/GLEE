"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm Alice, and I have a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  To kick off our negotiation, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```
 
This starting offer aims to:

* **Establish a strong initial position:** By starting significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you leave room for negotiation while aiming for a potentially exceptional outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity:** His response will give you valuable information about how much he values the product and how aggressively he might negotiate.

Remember, this is just the first move in a strategic negotiation. You'll adjust your approach based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While the product looks promising, that price is a little high for me.  Could we work with a figure closer to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below both your minimum price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table. While it's still early in the negotiation, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price.  You have the leverage of John's offer to fall back on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a more agreeable middle ground. How about $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While still aiming high, you've made a significant concession from your initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's reaction. Will he be more willing to move closer to your range now that you've made a concession, or will he hold firm around his initial offer?
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying above your minimum and Bob's perceived value, you retain leverage and signal the product's true worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However,  $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still below your guaranteed offer from John. Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation.  There's room to push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  Would you consider $1,250,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  This counteroffer represents a more measured concession, moving closer to the midpoint between your last offer and Bob's, but still leaning towards your desired outcome.
* **Anchoring:**  By staying above your safety net ($1,200,000), you maintain a strong anchor point in the negotiation, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** As you progress through the rounds, subtly introducing a sense of urgency can help move the negotiation along."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  $1,250,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for a price below $1,200,000. To be fair to both of us, would you consider $1,125,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's aiming for a price below $1,200,000.  While he might be willing to go slightly higher than his $1,125,000 offer, it's unlikely he'll reach your $1,200,000 minimum, especially with time running out. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it makes the most sense to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
