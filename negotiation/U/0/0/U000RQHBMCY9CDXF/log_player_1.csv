I'm starting with my desired price of $15,000. This is my floor price, and I know John is willing to pay it.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is closer to my floor price than his initial value of $12,000, it's still not where I want to be. I'll see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. It's still a good price for me, and I hope it's enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial desired price, it's getting closer and closer to my floor price of $15,000.  I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and having to settle with John at $15,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal."
