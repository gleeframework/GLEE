Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly higher than Bob's perceived value allows room for potential negotiation if he counter-offers.
* **Time Value of Money:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit margin.

This strategy aims to secure a sale quickly while still aiming for a price that significantly exceeds our minimum."
