Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the fact that there are other potential buyers. This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price of $1,450,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring the deal doesn't fall through and you end up selling to John at the lower price."
