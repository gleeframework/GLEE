"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob a good incentive to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, increasing his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, and I can still make counteroffers. I'm confident I can get a better price.
* **Selling to John is a Safe Option:** I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, so there's no rush to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering with a price that's still higher than his initial offer but lower than my starting price. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of the potential profit.
* **Fair Compromise:** The price of $1,000,000 offers a middle ground that could be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. Can we try $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Room:** I have 6 rounds remaining to potentially get a better offer from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a Secure Backup:** If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome.

I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I need to see a more significant price increase to consider accepting his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a fair compromise. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, encouraging him to see the $975,000 as a good investment.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $960,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm not willing to risk accepting a low offer.
* **Selling to John is Safe:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a secure option, and I have time to explore a deal with John if needed.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I need to see a more significant price increase to consider accepting his offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $960,000 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's close this now."", ""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm making another small concession, showing continued flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the idea that $990,000 is a good investment.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go above $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $960,000 and $990,000. Can we try $975,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price with Bob. 
* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me the best possible outcome in the limited time remaining.

I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but it's clear that we can't reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John is the most sensible choice at this point."
