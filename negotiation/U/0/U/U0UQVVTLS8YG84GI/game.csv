"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. Can we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a fair compromise. This price reflects the significant value you'll gain from owning this product.  Let's close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but $960,000 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $990,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal. Let's close this now.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go above $960,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $960,000 and $990,000. Can we try $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,8,
