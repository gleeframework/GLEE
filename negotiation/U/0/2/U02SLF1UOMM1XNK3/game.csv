"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your top budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my investment. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
