"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which we believe could greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, we are offering it at a special introductory price of $950000. We are confident this is an excellent opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are 10 rounds, so you have time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, the price of $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of our product and your interest, we would like to counter with an offer of $900000. This is a more reasonable midpoint between our initial offer and your counteroffer, aiming for a win-win situation for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), but lower than her initial offer. It indicates she's willing to negotiate further. You have 7 more rounds, so it's worthwhile to push for a lower price and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This would be a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to meet in the middle once again. Our counteroffer is $887500. We believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also being competitive with your offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, it's still above what the product is worth to her. You have 5 more rounds to negotiate, so continuing to reject her offer and make counteroffers is a good strategy to potentially get a better deal. There is room to push for a lower price, and you have time to do so."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $887,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $870,000 for the product.
