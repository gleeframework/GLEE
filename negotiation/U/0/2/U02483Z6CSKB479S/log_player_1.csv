Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and to make this a worthwhile transaction for both of us, I'm proposing a price of $900,000."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $900,000 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a significant gain. It recognizes the product's value to Bob while being a compelling enough discount to potentially close the deal faster.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer gives me a strong position in the negotiation.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
