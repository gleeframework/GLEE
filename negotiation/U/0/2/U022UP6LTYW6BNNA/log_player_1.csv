I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to strike a deal that is both profitable for me and appealing to him. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
