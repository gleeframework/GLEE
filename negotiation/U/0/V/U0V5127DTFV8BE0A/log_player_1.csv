{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll get a valuable product at a competitive price, and I'll still get a good return. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also provides a clear rationale for the price, making it more appealing than just stating a number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your perspective on market value, but this product is unique and holds a higher value for me.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,075,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.

While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I've gone through several rounds of negotiations with Bob and we're still quite far apart in our desired prices.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000, and Bob is unwilling to go any higher than $1,100,000.  While it's unfortunate that we couldn't reach an agreement, it's better to sell to John for $1,500,000 than to settle for a price significantly lower than my desired minimum."
