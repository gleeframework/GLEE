"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your stated value.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.",825000.0,Alice,3,
