Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its potential benefits. This is a fair price, and I believe it would be mutually beneficial for us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $1300000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1700000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,700,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a good starting point to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $1450000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still more than I want to pay.  Since I can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, I'll take that deal instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
