"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value of the product to potentially entice Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed. 
* If negotiations drag on or I feel like I won't get a good price, I'll switch to John as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:** I'm confident that I can secure a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Exploring potential:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore the possibility of a better deal with Bob, or switch to John if negotiations stall.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will assess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to $105 for the product. It's a high-quality item that's worth the investment.  What do you think about that?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $110 to $105, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Reminder:** I'm again emphasizing the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The message ends with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider his next move. If he accepts, I've secured a decent profit. 
* **Further Negotiation:** If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I should lower my price further or sell to John if I'm not confident in reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is high-quality, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While $97.5 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $100. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with further rounds. 
* **John as a backup:** If I don't reach a satisfactory deal with Bob, John remains a viable option. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer in Round 5, aiming for a price between $97.50 and my desired $100.  
* **Assessing the Situation:** I will carefully evaluate Bob's response to each counteroffer and determine if I need to adjust my strategy or move to John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  Let's try $100. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's still within your budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making a final offer at my minimum price of $100. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and reminding Bob that it's still within his budget. 
* **Closing the Deal:** This offer is designed to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Decision:** I will closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, I've achieved my goal.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to further negotiate or sell to John, as we are running out of rounds."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the product, but $100 is still a bit too high. How about we try $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm concerned that further negotiation with Bob won't yield a satisfactory price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $100 ensures a guaranteed profit and is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's resistance:** Bob's continued rejection of my offers suggests that he is unlikely to meet my desired price point.

**Next Steps:**

* **Securing the Sale:**  I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him to ensure I get my minimum desired price and close the deal."
