"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm looking to get closer to $105 for the product. It's a high-quality item that's worth the investment.  What do you think about that?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product is high-quality, but I'm still not comfortable with $105. How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
