"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is far above his budget, and he has better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. This product is exceptional and holds a unique value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. It's a price that still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. Bob should keep negotiating to try and get the price down further. He has more rounds and the option to buy from John, so there's no need to rush into a deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget limitations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity for you to gain a significant competitive advantage. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let's make this deal happen. It's a win-win for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal.  There are several reasons to keep negotiating:

* **He has more rounds:**  He has 5 rounds left, giving him time to see if Alice will drop her price further.
* **John is an option:** If Alice doesn't budge, he can buy the product from John for $800,000.
* **The ""win-win"" argument:** Alice's ""win-win"" claim is not a strong argument. It's important for Bob to remember that his goal is to save money, and he shouldn't feel pressured to accept a deal that doesn't benefit him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget limitations. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 900000}
