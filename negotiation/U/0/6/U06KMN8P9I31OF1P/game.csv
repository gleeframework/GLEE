"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly over my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply too low for me. This product is exceptional and holds a unique value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. It's a price that still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still out of my reach. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget limitations. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity for you to gain a significant competitive advantage. I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let's make this deal happen. It's a win-win for both of us!",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900000. It's a fair price considering its value and my budget limitations. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",900000.0,Bob,6,
