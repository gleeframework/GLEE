"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Considering the product's true value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable profit while offering you a good deal.  I'm open to further discussion, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this unique opportunity.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
