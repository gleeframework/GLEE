"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is my maximum. Let me know if you're open to discussing this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $1400000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $1200000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your maximum offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is a bit above your offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit away from my ideal price, but I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my sincerity in wanting to reach a deal.  Let's close this gap and finalize the purchase.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is a bit above your latest offer, but I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
