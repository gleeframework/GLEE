"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal quickly. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can come to an agreement at this price.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $10,125.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's get this done.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $9,900? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay.",9900.0,Bob,6,
