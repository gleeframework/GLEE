Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm flattered that you're willing to stretch your budget to $1,000,000, but I've already told you that's my minimum price. I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a small concession. I'll throw in some additional features and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. But the price remains the same: $1,000,000. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has made it clear that $1,000,000 is her absolute minimum price.  She's even throwing in extras to sweeten the deal. Accepting this offer gets you the product at the best possible price.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better outcome and risks losing the deal altogether."
