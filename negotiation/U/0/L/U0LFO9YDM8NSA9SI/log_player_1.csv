Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimum Value:** I know the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, so I want to get more than that.
* **Potential for More:** I don't know the value of the product to Bob, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $15,000.  Offering $20,000 gives me a good chance of getting a higher price while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, so I'm not risking much by offering a higher price to Bob."
