Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a calculated risk.  Here's the reasoning:

* **My Minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $12,000 to me, so that's my floor.
* **Potential Gain:**  By asking for $15,000, I'm hoping to get a higher price and increase my profit. 
* **The Backup:**  If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000, so there's no significant downside to taking the risk.

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
