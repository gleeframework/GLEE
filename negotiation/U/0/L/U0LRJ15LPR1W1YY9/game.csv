"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product and understand its potential value. However, I am looking to keep the investment within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, I believe the value of this product justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $975000, but I don't think I can go lower.  This would still allow you to significantly benefit from the product's unique features. Let's continue this discussion and find a mutually agreeable solution.",975000.0,Alice,3,
