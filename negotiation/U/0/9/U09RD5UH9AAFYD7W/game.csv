"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. Let's start with a price of $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. Let's try $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,000? I'm eager to close this deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $10,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to get some interest from other buyers, so let's finalize this deal soon.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! $10,500 is definitely a good price, but I'm still a bit tight on my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,250.  That's a fair compromise, and it will allow us to close the deal without me having to go to John.  What do you say?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, but I'd like to add a sense of urgency to the negotiation. I've had a few other interested buyers, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. Let's finalize this deal today at $10,500, or I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Alice,7,
