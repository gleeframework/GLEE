"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for potential profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the $1,200,000 I could get from John. I want to see if I can push Bob higher, and I have 8 more rounds to do so."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with a price slightly closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to reach a middle ground while emphasizing that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, it's still lower than what I'd ideally like to get. I have 6 rounds left to see if I can push him further.  If he doesn't budge, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's split the difference and settle on $935,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm trying to signal that I'm flexible and want to reach an agreement, but I'm not willing to give in completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting frustratingly close to my minimum, but not quite there.  I've only got four rounds left. While I could try to push Bob further, it's getting risky.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  I'm going to sell to John and secure the $1,200,000."
