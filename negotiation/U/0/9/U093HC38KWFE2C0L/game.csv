"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work involved.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
