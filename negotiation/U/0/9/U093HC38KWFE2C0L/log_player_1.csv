Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. However, it's still higher than John's offer. I should counter with a price closer to my target, leaving room for further negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the extensive work involved.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this work for both of us, I'm offering $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.
