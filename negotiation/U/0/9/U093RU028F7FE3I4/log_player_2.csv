"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, there's always room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even lower price. He's willing to pay up to $150, so he has some room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's tempting, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $100?  I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $110 to make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower.  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures Bob gets the product for a decent price."
