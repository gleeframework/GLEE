"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While the product seems interesting,  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. I can offer it to you for $1,300,000. It's a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's worth to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,200,000? This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, Bob, but I'd like to get closer to my initial offer of $1,500,000. I can offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
