Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000 to show you I'm serious.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still far too low. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  Let's try to find some common ground.  Would you consider $800,000 for the product? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob has reached his maximum price and it's still significantly below John's offer and my minimum. It's time to move on to ensure the best possible outcome."
