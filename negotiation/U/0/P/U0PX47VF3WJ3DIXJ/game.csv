"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,750,000.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but that's still much higher than what I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000 to show you I'm serious.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but I need to see a significant jump to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet halfway at $1,225,000?  This reflects my willingness to make a deal but also values the product fairly.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price.  Let's try to find some common ground.  Would you consider $800,000 for the product? That's the absolute highest I can go.",800000.0,Bob,6,
