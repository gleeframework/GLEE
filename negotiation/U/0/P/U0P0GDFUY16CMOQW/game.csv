"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still leaves some room for a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",11000.0,Bob,4,
