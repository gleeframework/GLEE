Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, he has room to negotiate and potentially make a profit.  This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to sell yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair offer that gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value and close to my last counteroffer. I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation."
