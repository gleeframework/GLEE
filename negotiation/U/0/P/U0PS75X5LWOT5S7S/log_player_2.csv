"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This price reflects its high value and the opportunity it presents to you. Let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000) but still below your maximum budget ($1,500,000). It's a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by rejecting and making a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm currently willing to pay.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise.
