Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if he counteroffers, and I'm confident that John will purchase the product for my minimum price if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise with Bob.  I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $80 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum price and I'm confident I won't get a better deal with him.  It's a good compromise, and selling to John would only net me $2 more."
