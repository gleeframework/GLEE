"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a fair price, and I get a quick sale.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This price still allows me to make a profit, while giving you a great deal on a valuable asset.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to save as much as I can on this purchase. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get a little worried we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $900,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not able to come up to that price, I'll have to look at other options.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000, which would be $850,000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price and make a deal",850000.0,Bob,6,
