Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's the most I can afford right now.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $8,500.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob is firmly rooted at $8,500 and unlikely to budge. It's better to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John than to continue haggling with Bob and risk a lower final price."
