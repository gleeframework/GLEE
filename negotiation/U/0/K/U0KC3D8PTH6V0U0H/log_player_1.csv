Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $145. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 tempts Bob with a small discount while still securing a profit for you. It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on value and willingness to make a deal, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
