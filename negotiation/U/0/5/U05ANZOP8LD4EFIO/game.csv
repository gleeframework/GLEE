Hello Bob! I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $125?  That's a good price for both of us and we can close this deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and go with $122.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say?",122.5,Bob,6,
