"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 
 
This opening offer is strategic:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $150 is a good starting point, ensuring you make a profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  This gives Bob room to feel like he can negotiate a better deal, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's accompanied by a friendly message:**  This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $130?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $120. I'm not willing to sell for less than that, so I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better deal.  I'm also still considering selling to John at this point, so Bob needs to come up with a more appealing offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $115 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $125?  That's a good price for both of us and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high. Let's split the difference and go with $122.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $122.50 is above my minimum price of $120, making it a profitable sale. It's also a good compromise, showing that Bob is willing to negotiate. While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a chance he might back out, and I might end up selling to John for $120.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
