"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a fair profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a good price for both of us, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
