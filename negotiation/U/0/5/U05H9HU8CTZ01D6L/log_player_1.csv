{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $110 initially allows for some room to negotiate downwards.
* **Not too high:**  $110 is still above Bob's perceived value of $80, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **Leaving room for John:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $120, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:** While I can sell to John for $120, I want to explore maximizing my potential profit with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my desired price:**  $90 is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer but still below my minimum requirement. 
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By lowering my price from $110, I demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to consider a counteroffer.
* **Highlight the value:** I emphasize the ""great price"" and the potential for Bob to still get a good deal, keeping him engaged."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a fair profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?  That's a good price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my desired price, $75 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum price.
* **John's offer is tempting:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $120. This acts as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still a bit below what I can accept.  I'm willing to go down to $85, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Show flexibility:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but maintaining a position that is closer to my desired price. 
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I emphasize the ""fair price"" for both of us to highlight that a deal is possible and beneficial for both parties. 
* **Close the deal:** I encourage Bob to close the deal by emphasizing that we are ""meeting in the middle""."
