Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000,  considering your interest.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

You're still within your budget with Alice's offer, but you're looking to save as much as possible. It's worth trying to get a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $13,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,500. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $12500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has stated that this is her final offer, and you're still within your budget. You can save $2,500 by accepting this offer. It's likely that continuing negotiations will only push the price back up."
