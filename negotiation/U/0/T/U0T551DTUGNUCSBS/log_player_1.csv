{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting point. I've chosen $200 because it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the recommendation, but I was hoping to stay within a budget of $150 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and it's likely that I won't get a better price if I keep negotiating. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
