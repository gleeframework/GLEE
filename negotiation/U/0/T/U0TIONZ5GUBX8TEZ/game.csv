,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference this time?  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen!",115.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $108. I'm trying to get as close to the value I think the product is worth to me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",108.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price considering the value this product has to you.  Let's close this deal.",112.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the point where I think I can live with this price, but I still need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",110.0,Bob,8,
