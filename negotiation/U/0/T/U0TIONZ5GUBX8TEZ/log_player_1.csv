Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also highlighting the value the product has to Bob to increase his incentive to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm adjusting my price downward, but not too drastically.  I want to show flexibility but also maintain my position that the product is worth more than $110."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm not in a rush, and I have the option to sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference this time?  I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm trying to close the gap with Bob by offering a price that's closer to his last offer. I'm also using persuasive language to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $108. I'm trying to get as close to the value I think the product is worth to me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $108, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm not sure how much wiggle room Bob has left, but I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price considering the value this product has to you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

I'm trying to make one final concession to Bob.  I'm hoping that this will be enough to get him to accept the offer, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to re-emphasize the value of the product to him to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the point where I think I can live with this price, but I still need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price,  Bob's offer of $110 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and it's better than selling to John."
