Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It leaves room for negotiation, and allows me to assess Bob's interest and potential to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $15,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this deal altogether. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to Bob for $12,000."
