Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'd be happy to let you have it for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $95, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $100. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not offering the absolute minimum I'd accept ($80) right away. This leaves me the flexibility to accept a counteroffer if it's close to my desired price.
* **Being friendly:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price of $80. This is a small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better result.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price or a deal falling through. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I were to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I can always fall back on John's $80 offer as a backup.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most practical decision, ensuring a quick sale and a price that is very close to my minimum."
