Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way above what I'm looking to spend. This product would be useful, but not at that price. I'd be willing to consider something closer to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand that $14,000 is a significant investment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 10500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving from your initial offer, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable going up to $7,500, but that's my limit.

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on your price, Alice, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9,000.  I'm willing to make one last offer of $8,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob is unlikely to go above $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer for $10,000."
