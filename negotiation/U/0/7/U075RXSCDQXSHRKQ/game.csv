"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $98 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $98. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $102. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $102, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $97 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",97.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $97. I'll offer you a final compromise: I'll meet you at $101. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",101.0,Alice,9,
