"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
