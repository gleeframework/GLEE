Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice has come down to $10,500. While she might be willing to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $10,250. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation to potentially save only $250, especially since you have the guaranteed option of buying from John at $10,000."
