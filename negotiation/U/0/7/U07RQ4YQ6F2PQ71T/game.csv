"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your initial offer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm not losing money. I'm counteroffering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",10500.0,Alice,5,
