"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
