"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for something worth at least $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product is worth $10,000 to Bob, her initial offer of $12,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer.  This shows Alice he's serious about getting a good deal and may encourage her to come down. 
* **Below Value:**  The $9,000 offer is still within Bob's value for the product but gives him some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  While making a firm counteroffer, Bob keeps the tone friendly to avoid alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Compromise:** Alice has lowered her price, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Staying Strategic:** Bob still has the option to buy from John for $10,000, so it's worth seeing if he can push Alice lower.
* **Counter-Offering:**  There's still room for negotiation, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the most strategic choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** Bob is meeting Alice halfway by offering $10,500, which is closer to her price but still within his budget.
* **Show of Good Faith:**  The counteroffer shows Bob is willing to compromise, but he's not willing to overpay.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Bob reiterates the value of the product to remind Alice that this is a good deal for both parties.
* **Call to Action:**  Bob ends with a clear call to action, pushing for a final agreement."
