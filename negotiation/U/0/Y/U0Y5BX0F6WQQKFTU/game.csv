"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
