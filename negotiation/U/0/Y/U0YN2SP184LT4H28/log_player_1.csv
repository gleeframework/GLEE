Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""demand"" are designed to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without trying to negotiate too much. 

**Important Note:** While John provides a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could be scared off by a very high initial price. This offer aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism."
