"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer and your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, I'm confident that this product will yield even greater returns for you. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
