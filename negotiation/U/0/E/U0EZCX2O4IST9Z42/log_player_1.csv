Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my ideal price of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested. $130 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would like to get closer to $135, it's getting late in the negotiation. Accepting Bob's offer is the best way to ensure I get a good price without risking selling to John for a lower price."
