"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about $1,200,000? This would be a good starting point for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a good outcome.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm ready to make a final compromise. Let's go with $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
