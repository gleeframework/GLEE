"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My starting offer is $1,400,000. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's less than John's price, there's room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a lower price to make it work.  How about $1,200,000? This would be a good starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This would give us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than my desired price. While it's closer to my target, it's still worthwhile to continue negotiating.  By rejecting, I can make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm ready to make a final compromise. Let's go with $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's getting close to my ideal range, and further negotiation might lead to more rounds without a guaranteed better outcome. It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept."
