"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be useful, but I think $1,400,000 is a little high.  How about we start at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1,125,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
