"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be useful, but I think $1,400,000 is a little high.  How about we start at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to secure a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to secure a higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $1,125,000 is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for you. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $1,175,000. This reflects the product's true worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm running out of time and John is offering my minimum value. It's a safer move to sell to John now and avoid the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
