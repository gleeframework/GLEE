Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,000,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should simply sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,200,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this price is more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to get closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential for Bob to walk away entirely, I'll accept his offer. This will secure a sale and a decent profit."
