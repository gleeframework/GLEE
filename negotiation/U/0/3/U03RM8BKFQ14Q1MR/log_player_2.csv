"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed. It's important to be respectful and offer a reasonable counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. It's worth rejecting the offer and continuing the negotiation process to potentially get a better price. There are still rounds available, and Bob might be able to convince Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  It's still below Alice's offer, but close enough to potentially entice her to accept. It's important to keep the negotiation moving forward and be flexible, while still remaining within Bob's budget."
