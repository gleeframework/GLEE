{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a significant profit for you, but also leaves room for Bob to counter if he wants to negotiate further.  It's important to be firm but also willing to negotiate a bit to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the same as John's, it's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to $1,150,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, I'm confident the product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $1050000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1025000. That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly more than John's offer of $1,000,000, and it's closer to the $1,050,000 you were aiming for.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit while avoiding further negotiation."
