Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is more than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $100 is less than what Bob thinks the product is worth, so there's room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have room to go up to his perceived value of $120 if necessary, while still making a good profit. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to get closer to your initial offer.  You can likely get a better price than $85. It's also good practice to make sure Bob knows you're willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $120.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92.50. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While it would be nice to get closer to my initial goal of $100, Bob's offer of $92.50 is a good compromise. It's still above my minimum of $80 and close enough to my initial offer that I'm comfortable accepting it."
