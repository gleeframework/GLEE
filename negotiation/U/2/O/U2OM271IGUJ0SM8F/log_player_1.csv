Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is significantly higher than what John is willing to pay, but leaves room for negotiation with Bob.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is holding firm at $1,100,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, this is a good deal. I'm not confident I'll get a better offer from him, and selling to John would mean a significantly lower profit."
