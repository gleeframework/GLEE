Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to accept such a drastic price reduction. I will counteroffer and try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and be willing to meet me halfway."
