"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it could be valuable to you too. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your consideration.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet the price of $11,000. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values.",10000.0,Bob,4,
