This offer allows me to make a significant profit while leaving some room for negotiation.  It also demonstrates that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value to me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
