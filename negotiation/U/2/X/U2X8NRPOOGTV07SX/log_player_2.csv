"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

$20,000 is way over Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. Could you consider stretching your budget to $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  It's wiser to go with John's offer of $12,000, ensuring Bob gets the product within his desired price range."
