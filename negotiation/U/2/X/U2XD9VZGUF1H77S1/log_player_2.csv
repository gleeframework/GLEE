"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile one.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for my budget of $12,000. I'll consider buying it from John for $12,000 instead.
