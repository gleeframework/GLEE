Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's important to start high to maximize your potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is close to your minimum, it's still below what you'd like to earn. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your initial asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to your initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $17,500 is less than what you initially hoped for, it's still above your minimum and a reasonable compromise.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob backing out or you being left with the lower price from John makes accepting this offer the more logical choice."
