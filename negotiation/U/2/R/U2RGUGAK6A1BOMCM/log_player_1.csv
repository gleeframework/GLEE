Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name].  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Directly expressing excitement and addressing Bob by name helps establish a positive and personalized tone.
* **Value-based pricing:** Highlighting the product's value before mentioning the price subtly anchors Bob's perception to a higher amount.
* **Strategic markup:**  Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you and Bob, there's room for negotiation. A markup of $300,000 allows for potential negotiation downward while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Open to discussion:** The phrasing ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process rather than presenting a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have some leverage (e.g., Bob might place a higher subjective value on the product, or you could have other interested buyers).
* Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Remember, your fallback is selling to John for $1,500,000."
