"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name].  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,800,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,800,000, which is $300,000 more than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* You can get the same product from John for your maximum budget, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
