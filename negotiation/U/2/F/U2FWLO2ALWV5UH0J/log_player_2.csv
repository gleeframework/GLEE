# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000. Even though the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, you can still get a good deal by accepting her offer and saving $1,000."
