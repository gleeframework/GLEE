"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the $800,000 range?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that far. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,050,000. This gives us both a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop my price a bit further, but we need to meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm offering $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting quite close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This leaves us both with some profit and feels like a fair deal at this point.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's call it $962,500. This leaves both of us with a reasonable profit and closes the gap between our offers.  How does this sound?",962500.0,Alice,7,
