{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps in the $800,000 range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to give it away for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that far. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,050,000. This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000. I have 6 more rounds to work with Bob, and I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However, $925,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to drop my price a bit further, but we need to meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm offering $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting quite close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This leaves us both with some profit and feels like a fair deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer once again.  While $950,000 is very close to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm hoping that Bob will come up a bit more in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's call it $962,500. This leaves both of us with a reasonable profit and closes the gap between our offers.  How does this sound?"", ""product_price"": 962500}
