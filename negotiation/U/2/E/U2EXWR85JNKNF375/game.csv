"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd find it highly beneficial. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. While this is above your estimated value, I believe the true potential and benefits you'll reap will far outweigh the initial investment. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but that price is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table with an offer.  However, my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant reduction and a testament to my desire to see this deal go through. What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum is $1,000,000. If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty. I've been transparent that this product holds significant value, and letting it go for anything less than $1,500,000 would be a loss for me. I'm willing to accept that loss to make this deal work, but I can't go any lower. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
