"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $120 is better than John's offer of $150.
* However, you can still get a better deal. You can try to negotiate with Alice to lower the price further, or wait to see if she makes a better offer."
