"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate it, $150 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it, but I'm not sure I can go higher. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair for me.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $125, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to buy it without going over my budget.",115.0,Bob,4,
