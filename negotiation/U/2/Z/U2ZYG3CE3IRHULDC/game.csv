"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I think that's a more reasonable price for the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
