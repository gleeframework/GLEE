"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer.**  You'd pay less from Alice.
* **However, you're aiming to save as much money as possible.**  You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you signal that you're not willing to accept her first offer, opening the door for further discussion and a potentially lower price."
