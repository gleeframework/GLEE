Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" you subtly imply the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a sense that he's getting a fair deal before you explore other options."
