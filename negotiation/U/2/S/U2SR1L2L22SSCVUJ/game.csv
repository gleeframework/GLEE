"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. It's a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it quite valuable. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm currently prepared to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $900000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest.  While $900000 is a good starting point, I need to consider the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1000000 is still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $950000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
