{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counter and see where we can land."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $95.  I'm not ready to accept his offer just yet and will try to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $85? That's still a great price for this product, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
