"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to start by offering the full $1,200,000. It's my ideal price and I'm not willing to go lower immediately. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and if he's willing to meet my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for anything less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000.  This is still a significant discount from my initial price, but it's closer to my minimum value, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Although it's closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price with more negotiation. I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise, but it's still above my minimum. I'm hoping to get a deal close to this point, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer, but they're still below my minimum acceptable value.  I've already made significant compromises, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  There's a risk that if I continue to negotiate, Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with nothing.  To avoid this, I'll sell to John for $1,200,000, which is my desired price."
