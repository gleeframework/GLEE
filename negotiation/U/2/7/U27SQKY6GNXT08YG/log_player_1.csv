Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your value:** You value the product at $8,000.
* **John's value:** John is your backup buyer and will pay $8,000.

By offering $12,000, you are:

* **Maximizing your profit:** You get a significantly higher price than selling to John.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob has a strong incentive to accept, as he'll still be getting a good deal.

This strategy aims to find a price that is attractive to Bob while still maximizing your own earnings."
