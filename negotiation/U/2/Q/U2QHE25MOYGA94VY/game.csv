"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $13,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,750. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $13,750 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. Would you consider $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it helps me stay within my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package worth $1,000, which will enhance the product's value even further. With this package, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, and the service package is a nice bonus. However,  I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to sell the product with the package for $13,750?  That way we can both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're committed to this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'll throw in an additional feature that will enhance the product's functionality, which is worth $500. With this new feature, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,250. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great value for both of us.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, and the added feature is definitely a plus. However, I'm still working within a tight budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,750? That price reflects the value of the product and the added features, and it's the best I can do at this time. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13750.0,Bob,8,
