"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,250 is a fair price for both of us, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
