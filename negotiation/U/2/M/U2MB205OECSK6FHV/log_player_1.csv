"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  However, $900,000 is significantly below the value I'm hoping to get for this product. Let's meet in the middle.

I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I still think $1,050,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the market price. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'll counteroffer one more time and if he rejects, I'll go with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. This is getting close to what I'm comfortable with. Let's call it $1,000,000. This is a final offer from me, as I'm confident you'll see the value this product holds for your business. If it's not a match for you at this price, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're down to the wire and Bob's offers are just not getting me close enough to my goal.  John's offer is guaranteed and secures my minimum, so that's the best choice for me at this point."
