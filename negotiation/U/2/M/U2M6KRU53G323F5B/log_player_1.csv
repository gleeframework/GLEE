Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $150.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $150 is still below the value I believe the product holds.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message indicates I'm open to discussing the price, which encourages Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Protecting my Interests:**  This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a price closer to my desired value.  It also gives me the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further.  This might encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **Protecting My Value:**  While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed option, I want to see if I can earn more by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate further, keeping the conversation open for a potential compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm sticking to a price that is still beneficial to me while acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my original price.
* **Strategic Position:**  By offering $110, I'm putting pressure on Bob to either accept or increase his offer if he wants to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $110 is still a bit too high for me though. I'm willing to pay $95.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still not ideal. 
* **No Room for Compromise:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that may not yield a better result. 
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might take more time and effort, while selling to John allows me to secure a sale quickly."
