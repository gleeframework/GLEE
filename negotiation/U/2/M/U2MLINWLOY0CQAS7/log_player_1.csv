"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive. I acknowledge the deal is good for both of us, which can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

I want to start by testing the waters and seeing if Bob is even interested at a price significantly higher than his perceived value. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and how many rounds I have left. If he accepts, I've already made a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to offer $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I have several rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round.

**Reasoning:**

Selling to John immediately would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I want to explore if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob.  The risk is that Bob might walk away, but I'm willing to take that chance to maximize my potential earnings."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're interested, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility but still leaves a significant profit margin for me. 
* **Message:** I'm firming up my stance. I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide. I also mention exploring other options, subtly reminding him that he might lose the deal.

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to go much higher.  By making a firm counteroffer, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll be ready to adjust my strategy further based on the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose an offer of $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I believe I can still achieve a better outcome.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I have several rounds remaining and want to see if I can push Bob further. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the deal at a more favorable price.

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John immediately would guarantee $1,500,000, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to that amount by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's a risk that he might walk away, but I'm willing to take that chance in hopes of securing a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still too far off. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but I need to see some movement from your side.  Let's find a number that works for both of us. I'm open to your next proposal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm sticking with $1,100,000. This is my ""sweet spot"" - still a profit for me, but leaves room for some compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge progress but reiterate my position. I'm expressing openness to Bob's next proposal but subtly emphasizing that I'm not willing to budge much further.

**Reasoning:**

With five rounds remaining, I want to demonstrate flexibility without conceding too much. By keeping the price steady, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to make a more significant counteroffer. If he doesn't, I can start to lower my price more aggressively in the next few rounds."

**Reasoning:**

Selling to John immediately would secure me $1,500,000, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can reach a higher price with Bob. The risk is that Bob might walk away, but I'm still optimistic that we can find a mutually agreeable solution."

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,087,500. This is a smaller concession than before, showing that I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm still emphasizing the importance of compromise, but I'm also suggesting that this could be the final offer. This adds a bit of pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting down to the wire with only three rounds remaining.

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  Although Bob's final offer of $1,082,500 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **No More Rounds:**  With no more rounds left, I'm forced to make a decision.  

**Reasoning:**

While I would have loved to get closer to my ideal price, I cannot risk losing the deal entirely.  By selling to John, I guarantee myself a significant profit and avoid the risk of walking away with nothing."
