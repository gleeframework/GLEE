"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, there's no reason to jump at it immediately. You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If negotiations fail, you have the safety net of buying from John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you consider $12,000? I'm ready to close the deal quickly at that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit. I can do $14000, but that's as low as I can go. The product is worth so much more to me than that, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $14,000, which is a good price considering your maximum is $15,000.  It's a small saving, but it's better than nothing. Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice walking away, forcing you to buy from John at the same price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a slightly better price."
