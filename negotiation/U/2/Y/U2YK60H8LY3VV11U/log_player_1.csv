Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, while staying within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
