"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price point.** You're willing to pay $15,000, but no more.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to consider other options.**  You'll still have the option to buy from John for the same price. 

Since you have the option to buy from John for the same price, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and keep your options open. You might be able to find a better deal elsewhere or negotiate a lower price with John."
