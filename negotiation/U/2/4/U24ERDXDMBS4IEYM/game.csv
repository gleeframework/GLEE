,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $11,000?  This is a fair price that still allows me to get a decent value for my product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $10,500?  I'm really trying to make this work for both of us, and I believe this price is a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
