``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation if he chooses to counter. It also keeps the potential sale to John open as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $11,000?  This is a fair price that still allows me to get a decent value for my product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $10,500?  I'm really trying to make this work for both of us, and I believe this price is a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we're getting close, Alice! I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. I really like the product, and I think this is a fair price. Can you accept this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough.  I've already spent a few rounds negotiating with Bob, and I don't want to risk him rejecting my next counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a much higher price, so I'll go ahead and sell it to him."
