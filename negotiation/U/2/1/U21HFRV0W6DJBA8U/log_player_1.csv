Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to respond and potentially start a counteroffer negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below the product's worth to me.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can push for a higher price.
* **Minimizing risk:** While John is a guaranteed sale, I want to explore all options and see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000, while leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I think we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm open to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this price is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm expressing a willingness to come down, implying that this might be the best offer he'll get. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll have secured a good sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider my next move, deciding whether to make another counteroffer or switch to selling to John for $1,500,000."
