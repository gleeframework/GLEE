"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you for $220. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal."", ""product_price"": 220} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($150) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This establishes a high anchor, potentially making subsequent offers seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price provides ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps me gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is still significantly lower than my absolute minimum of $150. 
* **Potential for More:** While closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have the security of selling to John for my minimum, so I can afford to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I value your offer, $120 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you do $180?"", ""product_price"": 180}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but Above Minimum:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility, but I'm still well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer aims to meet Bob somewhere in the middle, encouraging him to also make a more significant move.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** The tone remains polite but firm, reiterating that his initial offer was too low while still expressing a desire to find a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $160 is now above my absolute minimum of $150.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially negotiate for a bit more, the additional gain is likely to be small, and there's a risk of Bob backing out.
* **Time Value:** Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. It's often better to take a good deal now than risk losing it for a slightly better one later."
