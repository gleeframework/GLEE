"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, leaving room for negotiation, but also attractive to Bob since it's below his perceived value.  It sets a positive tone while also demonstrating that you are serious about a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be reasonable. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay more than that, as he values the product at $1,500,000.  There's still room for negotiation, and you have 8 more rounds to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that is higher than your minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:** Reminding Bob of the product's value to him emphasizes the fairness of the offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains polite and focuses on finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too far apart. How about we try $1250000? That's the best I can do right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is coming closer to your minimum, $1,250,000 is still below your acceptable price.  There are still 6 rounds remaining, and you have leverage as Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to pay more than $1,200,000. You can likely squeeze out a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer.  I'm sure you understand that this product is incredibly valuable to you and represents a significant opportunity. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This offer is positioned as your final offer, adding pressure for Bob to accept.
* **Appeal to Value:**  The message reminds Bob of the product's value to him, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that this product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1260000, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is only slightly below your last counteroffer, it's important to keep in mind that you only have 4 rounds left. Selling to John at this point would guarantee your minimum acceptable price, but you're still in a strong negotiating position. By rejecting Bob's offer, you can potentially get a better price in the next few rounds. You've already demonstrated your willingness to compromise, and Bob has shown a clear interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're trying to get the best deal. While I value your business, I can't go lower than $1,270,000.  This is my final offer.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1270000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This offer is again positioned as final, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Appeal to Business:** The message highlights the value of a successful deal for both parties, emphasizing the mutually beneficial outcome.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1255000, but I think we can do better. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,255,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,255,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, the negotiation is reaching a stalemate. Bob's offer is steadily decreasing, and you're nearing your minimum acceptable price. While there's a chance you could get a slightly better offer in the next round, the risk of losing the deal is significant.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
