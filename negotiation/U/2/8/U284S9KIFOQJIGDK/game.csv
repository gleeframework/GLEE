"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500? I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll be getting.",9000.0,Alice,5,
