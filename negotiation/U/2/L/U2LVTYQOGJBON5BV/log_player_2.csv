Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is asking for more.  It makes sense to counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000?  That's a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs and ensures you get a fantastic product.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still willing to pay up to $15,000.  Even though Alice came down a bit, it's still higher than his maximum.  It's worth seeing if she'll come down further or if it's time to move on to John."
