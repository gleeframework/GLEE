"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?  I feel that's a fair offer reflecting the value it holds for me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a deal at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's the best compromise we can reach.",850000.0,Alice,5,
