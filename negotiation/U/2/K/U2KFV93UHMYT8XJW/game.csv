"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
