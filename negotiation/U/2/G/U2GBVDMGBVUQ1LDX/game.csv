"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
