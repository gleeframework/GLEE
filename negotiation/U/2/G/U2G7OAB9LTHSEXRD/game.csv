"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it gives me a fair price. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to be careful with my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle for $1,275,000? This is a fair compromise and ensures we both get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $1,225,000? I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,250,000 for this to be worthwhile for me. Let's make this work, I think we're very close!",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. How about we try $1,200,000? I'm willing to make one more concession, but I really think this is as low as I can go.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
