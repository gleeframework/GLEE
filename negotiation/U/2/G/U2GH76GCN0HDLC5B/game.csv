"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my research and the product's market value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is substantial, and $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $1,125,000 is still above my budget though. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  I believe it's a fair price given the product's value and market conditions. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is appealing, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm glad we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a middle ground. Let's try $1,000,000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
