Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for you while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob. It's a price that's significantly less than what John is willing to pay but still well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially nudging Bob to act quickly."
