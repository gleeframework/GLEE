(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,025,000 is tempting as it's getting close to your budget, it's still not ideal.  At this point, it's clear Alice is not willing to go lower than $1,000,000. It's safer to go with the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000.  You save a significant amount of money and avoid further negotiations."
