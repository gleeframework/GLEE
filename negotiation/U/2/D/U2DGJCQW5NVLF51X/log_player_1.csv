"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm going to start high, aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows for negotiation room and sets a strong starting point.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value through counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating. While $1,500,000 from John is tempting, I believe I can get closer to that amount by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit from the initial offer, but still keep it significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth a considerable amount.  This also leaves room for further negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my desired value. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to further lower my price to $1,000,000. This shows continued flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still maintaining a significant profit margin. I'm confident that this will prompt Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my target. I believe there's still room for improvement, and I'm willing to keep negotiating.  The $1,500,000 from John is tempting, but I think I can get closer to that with a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm making a small concession to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm confident that this offer, only slightly lower than his last one, will push him towards a deal. If he rejects again, I will strongly consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still a long way from my desired value.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with a lower price.  I'm going to take the secure deal with John for $1,500,000."
