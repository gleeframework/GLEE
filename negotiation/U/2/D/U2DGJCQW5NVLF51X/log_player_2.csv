{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my absolute maximum budget of $800,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes my position and leaves room for some negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal quickly and will be willing to accept."

{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to my budget, I am still trying to save as much money as possible.  I want to see if I can get her to come down just a little bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 960000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer just below Alice's latest offer.  This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but still trying to save as much as possible. It's a risky move, as Alice might reject it. If she does, I'll have to make a decision about whether to accept her offer or go with John's deal."
