Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a steal considering its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've made the message friendly and enticing. I've highlighted the product's value and offered it as a ""steal"" to make it more appealing. 

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer aims to start the negotiation process with a strong but not unreasonable price.
* The message is designed to create a positive and engaging tone.
* This initial offer is high enough to potentially secure a good deal but allows for potential negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I would like to get. I believe there is room for further negotiation, and I want to explore that possibility before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this deal happen. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes fairness and encourages further negotiation. It frames the price as a compromise, aiming to make Bob feel like it's a reasonable offer.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* It aims to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal.
* The message is designed to be positive and persuasive, encouraging Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still unable to meet your previous offer of $10500. However, I am willing to pay $10000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my desired price point. While I would ideally like to get more, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. It's only $500 lower than my last counteroffer, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. 

**Strategy:**

* It's important to weigh the potential gains of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal entirely. 
*  Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that's still within my acceptable range."
