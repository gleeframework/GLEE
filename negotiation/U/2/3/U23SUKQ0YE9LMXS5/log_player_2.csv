**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the best she's made so far:** It's only $8 more than Bob's desired price of $130, and significantly lower than John's price of $150.
* **Limited time:** With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a chance Alice might not budge further. 
* **Compromise:** Accepting the offer shows Bob is willing to compromise and secure a good deal."
