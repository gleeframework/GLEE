"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. It's still a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $95 is still a bit too far off.  How about $105? That's a good deal for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,6,
