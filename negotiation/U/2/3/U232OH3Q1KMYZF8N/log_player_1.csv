Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that?

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's getting down to the wire, and I don't want to risk a deal falling through. John is guaranteed to buy the product at my minimum price, so it's the safest option."
