"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $700,000 just isn't viable for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,5,
