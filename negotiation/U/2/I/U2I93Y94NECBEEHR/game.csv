"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think?",85.0,Bob,4,
