Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for both of us, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $85 is only slightly lower than what John is offering, and it's closer to my desired price.  I'll accept and move on to the next deal."
