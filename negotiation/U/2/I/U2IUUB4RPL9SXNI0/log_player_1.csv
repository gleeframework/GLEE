"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  I think it's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more than that to you!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's just below the midpoint between my minimum and Bob's maximum, to see if I can get a quick deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130, but that's my absolute top price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a fair price, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility and hopefully encourages him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob has been firm at $130.  It's a decent price for me, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to counteroffer.  It's better to secure the sale now."
