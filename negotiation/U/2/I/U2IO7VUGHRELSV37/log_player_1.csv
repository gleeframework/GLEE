Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We are still making good progress and Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range. It's too early to settle for John's offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,375,000, but I think we can do better than that. My revised offer is $1,350,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

While we could continue negotiating, Bob seems to be firm on his $1,350,000 offer. Accepting this offer gives us a $150,000 profit over John's offer. It's a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
