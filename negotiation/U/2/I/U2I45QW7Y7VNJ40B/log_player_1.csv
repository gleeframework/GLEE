Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to potentially earn even more. 
* **Guaranteed Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're guaranteed to sell to John for $150. This knowledge empowers you to aim higher with Bob."
