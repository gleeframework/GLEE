"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? I'm getting close to considering John's offer at $10,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $8,800 is getting closer, but I can't go lower than $8,900.  Let's wrap this up and make a deal.  I'm not sure how much longer I can wait, as I do have another buyer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
