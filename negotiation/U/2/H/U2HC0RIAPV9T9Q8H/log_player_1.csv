Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $120, but willing to hear you out if you have a different number in mind."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to both offer a price and gauge Bob's interest. His response will tell Alice if he's willing to negotiate closer to her desired price. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice is safe knowing John will buy the product for $80, ensuring she doesn't lose out. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of negotiation."
