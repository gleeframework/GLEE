"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the value to me and the potential profit you could still make.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of that, I am willing to consider an offer closer to your suggested price. Therefore, I propose a price of $11,000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable profit while acknowledging your valuation of the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
