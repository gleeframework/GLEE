Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. How about $150? I'm sure we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I know the product is worth $150 to me. Accepting his offer would leave me with no profit. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price."
