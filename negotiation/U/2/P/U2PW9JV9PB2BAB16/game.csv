"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. Could we work something out?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to consider $10,500, which reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,000.  That's a good step in the right direction.  To make this work for me, I'd need to see $11,000.  This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both parties.",11000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. While I value your interest and your willingness to go up to $10,500, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000.  Could we meet in the middle at $10,750?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to move forward with this transaction.",10750.0,Alice,7,
