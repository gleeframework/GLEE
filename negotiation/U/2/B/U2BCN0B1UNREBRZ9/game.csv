"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $17,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'd like to save some money. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $15,500? This would still give you a good price and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $15,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to save as much as possible. What do you think?",13500.0,Bob,4,
