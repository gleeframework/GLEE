"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  Let's close this deal and you can start enjoying the product!",120.0,Alice,5,
