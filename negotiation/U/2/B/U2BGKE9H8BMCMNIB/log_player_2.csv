"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Alice's first offer is quite close to my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

Explanation: I've countered with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. This way, I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: Alice is negotiating, which is good. While $125 is closer to my goal, I still have room to haggle and try to get the price down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

Explanation: I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $120?  Let's close this deal and you can start enjoying the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Explanation: Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and $120 is a reasonable price that falls within my budget. It's unlikely I'll get a significantly better deal from Alice at this point, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing the deal away."
