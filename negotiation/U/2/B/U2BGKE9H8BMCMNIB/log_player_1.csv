Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $110 is too low for me.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
