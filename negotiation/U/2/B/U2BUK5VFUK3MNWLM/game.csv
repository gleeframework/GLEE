"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you mentioned. I can meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. Would that work for you?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $13500. How about we try $11500? I'm really interested in making a deal, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about $14000? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a more reasonable compromise.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $12500? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $12500. I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $13750? It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13750.0,Alice,7,
