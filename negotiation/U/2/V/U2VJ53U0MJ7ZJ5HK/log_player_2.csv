"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price of $10,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```
