{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is exactly $120.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer, as you can get the same product from John for the same price. You might be able to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price if you reject her offer."
