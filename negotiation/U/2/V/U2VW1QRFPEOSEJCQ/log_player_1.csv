Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $925,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so we're not desperate. This allows us to aim high with Bob."
