Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,000,000) but slightly below Bob's perceived value ($800,000) gives you room to negotiate while aiming high.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies you are open to discussing the price, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer if he's interested.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective and leaving space for a mutually beneficial deal."
