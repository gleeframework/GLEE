"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000.  This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he may be willing to pay a bit more than my asking price to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is still a profit for me, I can likely do better by counter-offering. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,200 is still a significant profit and I'm concerned that if I continue to reject offers, I might end up with a lower price or even lose the deal altogether. It's better to take a good offer than risk getting a worse one later."
