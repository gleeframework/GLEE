"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $11,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,500 is below Bob's maximum price of $12,000.
* **Alice stated this is her final offer:** This suggests further negotiation might be fruitless, and Bob risks losing the product.
* **Value for Bob:**  While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price, the potential savings might not be significant enough to justify the risk of losing the deal.  

Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that is within Bob's budget and leaves room for profit if he plans to resell it."
