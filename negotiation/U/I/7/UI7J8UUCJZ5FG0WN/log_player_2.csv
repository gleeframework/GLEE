"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating further. It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer to show Alice he's serious about getting a good price.  He's aiming for a price closer to his maximum, but leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for a more competitive price in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still push for a lower price. He has shown Alice he's willing to negotiate and that he values the product at less than $14,000.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a price closer to his ideal $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility while still staying within his budget. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating that he's willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's a strategic move to gauge Alice's willingness to close the deal at this price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's ideal price of $12,000.  While a slightly lower price is always desirable, accepting this offer allows Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, ensuring that Bob gets a good deal without risking a further round of negotiations that might lead to a stalemate."
