"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring negotiation before jumping to the $10,000 price.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  A $1,500 drop from her initial offer is a good starting point. If she rejects this, I can adjust my offer upwards in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but I still think I can get a better price. I'm not ready to jump at $6,500 when my maximum is $10,000. Another counteroffer will see if she's willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a commitment to reaching an agreement while maintaining my goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now within my desired price range and is getting closer to my counteroffer.  Accepting her offer at $6,375 is a good deal, saving me over $3,500 compared to buying from John.  There's always the risk of further negotiation, but the potential gains seem smaller than the risk of losing this deal and having to pay John's higher price."
