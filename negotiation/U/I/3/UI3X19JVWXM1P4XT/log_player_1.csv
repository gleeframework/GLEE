Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really find it useful. I'm asking for $140, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, at $140, which is still lower than the product's worth to Bob. It also emphasizes that I'm open to negotiation, making it more likely that Bob will counteroffer rather than outright reject the offer. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get closer to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is a decent offer, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I can still try to get closer to my ideal price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. I have a better chance of getting a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $130? That would be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That would be a good compromise for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating and try for a higher price, $125 is a good compromise and getting closer to my desired price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's lower offer of $100. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit."
