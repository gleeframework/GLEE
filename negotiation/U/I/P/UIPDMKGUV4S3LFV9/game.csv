"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,200,000.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is quite high, given my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, so how about we meet halfway? I propose $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,500,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000. This is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're willing to reconsider.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, but I need to be closer to my target price. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a compromise on my side, and I believe it's a fair price considering our negotiations so far. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,6,
