I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a good starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer, keeping in mind John's offer of $12,000 as my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,500. This is still a good price for him, as it's below the $13,000 I initially offered, and it's a fair compromise, allowing for a bit of profit for me while ensuring a deal. If he rejects this offer again, I'll have to seriously consider selling it to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk continuing to negotiate and potentially lose the sale entirely. John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll take his offer and sell the product to him."
