"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a steal for a product you value at $10,000!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $9,000, so I'll offer $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
