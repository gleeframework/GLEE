"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think it's worth a bit more than $18000. How about we try $19500? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",19500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $18500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $19000? It's a small step down from my initial offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",19000.0,Alice,5,
