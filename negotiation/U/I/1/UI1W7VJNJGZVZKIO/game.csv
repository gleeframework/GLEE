"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be open to $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm willing to go down to $10,200. That's the lowest I can go without losing money. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $10,200 is very tempting, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,900. Would that be possible for you?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really close to making a decision. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,100. This is as low as I can go without losing money. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,7,
