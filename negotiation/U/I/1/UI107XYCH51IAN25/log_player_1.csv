I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'll reject this offer and try to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $11,500."

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, while still keeping the price above Bob's last offer."
