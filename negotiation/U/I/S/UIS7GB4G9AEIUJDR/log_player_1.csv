Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, meaning you'll still profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

However, if Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to be prepared to either accept a lower counteroffer, or switch to John for the $10,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John for $10,000, I still believe there's room for a better deal. Bob values the product at $15,000, and a counteroffer could bring us closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is offering. There's no further room for negotiation with Bob, as he's already at his maximum budget.  At this point, it's more efficient and less risky to sell to John, as I'm guaranteed the same amount."
