Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to make sure Bob doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it slightly above his valuation might entice him to buy while still giving Alice a significant profit. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's no need to go below that price.

By offering the product at $11,000, Alice creates a win-win situation where she makes a $1,000 profit and Bob gets the product for less than his maximum valuation."
