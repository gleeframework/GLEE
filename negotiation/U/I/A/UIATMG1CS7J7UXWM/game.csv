"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a better deal. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $650000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
