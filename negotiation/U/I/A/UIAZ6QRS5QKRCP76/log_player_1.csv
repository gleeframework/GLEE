Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find common ground, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $1,050,000 is my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again and find a price that works for both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,050,000. While it's not ideal, we're past the halfway point in negotiations and Bob is unlikely to budge significantly. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John's deals if negotiations drag on."
