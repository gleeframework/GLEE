"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think the initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept a price as low as $1,200,000.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
