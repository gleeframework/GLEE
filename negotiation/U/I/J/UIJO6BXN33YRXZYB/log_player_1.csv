Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think the initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I can go up to $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $1,325,000 is a smart move. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of him walking away or further dragging out the negotiation."
