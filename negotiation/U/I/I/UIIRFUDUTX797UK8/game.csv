"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $850,000? I think that's a fair price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we compromise at $925,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference and settle at $912,500? That would be a win-win for both of us.",912500.0,Bob,6,
