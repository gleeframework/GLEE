You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is getting closer to your maximum price. While you can try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject your next offer and you'll be forced to buy from John.  Accepting $9,750 is a good compromise, saving you $250 compared to John's price."
