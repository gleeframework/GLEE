Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,400,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of a good deal.
* **The message** is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Remember:** I can always walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1350000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** 
* **I want to maximize my profit, so rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering allows for further negotiation.**  
* **There's still room to reach a price closer to my initial $1,400,000 offer.** 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,350,000 is slightly below what I'm aiming for. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $1,375,000 is a compromise,  It's a $25,000 increase from Bob's offer and is still $25,000 lower than my initial offer.
* **Message:** The message remains positive, highlighting the value of the product and my willingness to compromise.  This helps keep the negotiation friendly.
* **Strategy:** By meeting in the middle, I show flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. This increases the chances of reaching a deal. 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to counteroffer again or accept John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $1360000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am very interested in acquiring the item but need to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,360,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's final offer is $1,360,000.** This is only $15,000 less than my last counteroffer of $1,375,000.
* **Selling to John for $1,200,000 would yield a much lower profit.** 
* **Accepting Bob's offer ensures a reasonable profit and concludes the negotiation.**

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  accepting Bob's final offer is the most logical decision to maximize my profit."
