"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and the potential value it offers me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount based on its features and market potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,950,000 is still outside my acceptable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I believe this represents a fair compromise given the product's potential and my budget constraints.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to see a bit more flexibility from you.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000 to close this deal today. This offer stands as a testament to my belief in your ability to utilize this product effectively. Let me know your decision.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm going to make one final offer of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
