Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth rejecting and starting negotiations."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value significantly exceeds that amount based on its features and market potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price, but it's also getting close to the price I can get from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,950,000 is still outside my acceptable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer.  I believe this represents a fair compromise given the product's potential and my budget constraints.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I need to see a bit more flexibility from you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000 to close this deal today. This offer stands as a testament to my belief in your ability to utilize this product effectively. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still too high for me.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but if she rejects it I'm going to buy from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm going to make one final offer of $1,400,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
