"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's target price of $12,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's closer than before,  Bob is better off buying from John for $12,000 to ensure he stays within his budget."
