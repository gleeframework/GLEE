"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
