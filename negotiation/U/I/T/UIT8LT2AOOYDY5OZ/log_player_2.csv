"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $130 is above Bob's maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price and knows that John is willing to sell for $100. This counteroffer establishes Bob's bottom line and puts pressure on Alice to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100. Although it's closer, there's still room for negotiation.  Since Bob can always buy from John for $100, rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from $100 to $110. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but also maintains a price point below his budget.  It's a strategic move to see if Alice will accept a price closer to Bob's ideal target."
