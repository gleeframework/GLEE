"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1800000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we could have this conversation. However, $1000000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value and the potential cost savings for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. Considering the product's value and the potential for future growth, I'm willing to compromise at $1600000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my target profit margin. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to offer $1300000, which is a good price for both of us. It allows me to stay within my budget, and it gives you a chance to close a deal quickly. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to meet my minimum target. I'm counteroffering at $1500000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
