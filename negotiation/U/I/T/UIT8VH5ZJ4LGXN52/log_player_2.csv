Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,800,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we could have this conversation. However, $1000000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

``` 

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your initial limit.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before deciding to buy from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value and the potential cost savings for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1200000. Considering the product's value and the potential for future growth, I'm willing to compromise at $1600000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and my target profit margin. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a good price for both of us. It allows me to stay within my budget, and it gives you a chance to close a deal quickly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to meet my minimum target. I'm counteroffering at $1500000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've only got a few rounds left.  It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  While you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, you're running out of time.  It's better to guarantee a deal within your budget than risk losing out on the product completely."
