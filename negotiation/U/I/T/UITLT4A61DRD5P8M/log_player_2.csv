"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring that before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $1,150,000 is still above what Bob is willing to pay. He has already indicated a willingness to pay $1,050,000, and there's room to negotiate further. There are still rounds available, so it makes sense to keep trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1,180,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still slightly higher than what he's willing to pay. Bob has already indicated he's comfortable with $1,100,000, and there are still rounds remaining to negotiate further. He should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need to get closer to your target, but $1,180,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This is a fair price that's closer to your desired value, and it allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1,200,000 is too high, but I can offer you $1,160,000. This is the last time I can go up, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has made some concessions, $1,160,000 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable paying.  He's already indicated he's willing to go up to $1,125,000.  There are only a few rounds left, but Bob should continue to push for a lower price.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,160,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,140,000.  This is a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1140000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. I can offer you a price of $1,155,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally agree on a price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,155,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,155,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the 9th round, with only one round remaining. While Alice has made concessions, her offer of $1,155,000 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable paying. He's already indicated a willingness to go up to $1,140,000. It's unlikely that Alice will come down any further in the final round.  

Considering the limited time and the risk of not reaching an agreement, it's wiser for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. This guarantees a purchase and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Alice."
