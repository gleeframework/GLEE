"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product, and it's a compromise between our initial offers. What are your thoughts?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $16000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to save as much as possible. Can we meet at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but $14000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $17000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $17000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $17000, which would be $15500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to pay it. Can we agree on $15500?",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but $15500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",16500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to get a bit more for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $16250. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What are your thoughts?",16250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're very close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to know if you're willing to accept it. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000. I'm not willing to go any higher than $16000.",16000.0,Bob,10,
