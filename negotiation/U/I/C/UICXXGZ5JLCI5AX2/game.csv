"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, but I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your offer of $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to go down to $850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
