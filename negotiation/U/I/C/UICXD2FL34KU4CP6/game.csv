,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I can meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $175 for the product?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $175 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $170? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",170.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $170 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really close to walking away, but I still want to make a deal. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165? I think that's the lowest I can go.",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really close to walking away, and I don't want to lose the sale. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $167? I think that's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",167.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, but $167 is still a bit above my budget. I'm really close to walking away, and I'm not sure if it's worth it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $165 and $167. Would you be willing to consider $166? That's the lowest I can go.",166.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than $166. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's make a deal!",166.0,Alice,9,
