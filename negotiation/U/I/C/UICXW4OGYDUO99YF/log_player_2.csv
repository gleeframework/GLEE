# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $125. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice's offer of $125 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and also saves you money compared to buying from John for $150."
