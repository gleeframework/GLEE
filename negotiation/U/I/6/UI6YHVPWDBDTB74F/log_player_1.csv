{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by:

* **Being assertive:**  It's not a ""take it or leave it"" price but indicates a strong starting point.
* **Highlighting the value for Bob:**  Mentioning the product's worth to him makes it more appealing. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $14,000 is a good starting point, but not unreasonable for Bob to counter.

This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than $12,000 from John, while still being open to a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's tempting to take his offer,  I can still do better.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  It's well below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you considering what the product is worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's more than what John would pay, and it still leaves some room for profit.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
