"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is simply too low for me.  It's well below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you considering what the product is worth. Let me know your thoughts.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,4,
