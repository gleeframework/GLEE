"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know you'd find extremely valuable. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  Consider this a chance to acquire something special at a significant discount.  Are you interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
