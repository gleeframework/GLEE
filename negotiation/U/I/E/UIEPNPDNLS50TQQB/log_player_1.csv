"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. I think it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that is below my minimum but still gives me some room to negotiate. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make on this sale. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can do better. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'll stick to my budget and propose $100 as the final offer. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While there's a chance he might increase his offer in the future, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and am close to my minimum. At this point, it's better to secure the $150 from John and move on."
