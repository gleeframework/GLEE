"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, that's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $700,000 remains too far from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000 as my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
