Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $700,000 remains too far from what I have in mind.  I'm willing to drop to $1,600,000 as my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for me. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
