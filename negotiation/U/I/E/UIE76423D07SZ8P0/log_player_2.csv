"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're confident it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its worth to you is $100, I propose we discuss a fair price that respects both our interests. Would you be open to exploring a price range that might work for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to establish that the product is worth $100 to you, even though you have a maximum budget. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay that high. It opens the door for a counter-offer, potentially closer to her $80 valuation.  You still have John as a backup option."
