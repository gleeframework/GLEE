"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$60 is a good price, but I can likely get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 25% lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about negotiating and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $55 is a better price than Alice's first offer, I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my initial counteroffer of $45.  There's still room to negotiate and I don't want to settle too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $50. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe there's room for a middle ground. It also sets up a clear path for us to reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $57. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $57
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $57 is getting closer to my ideal price point, and we're halfway through the negotiations.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become stubborn and I might end up paying more than $57. It's better to secure this decent price now rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
