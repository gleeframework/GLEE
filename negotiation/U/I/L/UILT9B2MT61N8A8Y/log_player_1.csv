"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong anchor price. This initial offer is significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The high starting point allows for concessions throughout the negotiation while still aiming for a final price well above your minimum.
* **Gauging Bob's Response:** This offer is designed to elicit information about Bob's true interest level and potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly above his $1,000,000 valuation. This suggests there's room for further negotiation. We're aiming to capture as much of the value difference as possible. Selling to John at this point would be accepting a significant loss compared to Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this. $1,800,000 is a significant step, but the value this product brings to the table is undeniable. How about we meet halfway at $2,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer ($250,000), demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:** However, the counteroffer is still substantially above Bob's offer, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. A rejection here could indicate a need to adjust our strategy or consider John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but not quite that high. How about $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, a good sign that he's motivated. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:**  The difference between our offer ($2,050,000) and his ($1,900,000) is significant enough to warrant further negotiation. We're still aiming to capture more of the value surplus.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have six rounds remaining. While selling to John is always an option, accepting Bob's current offer feels premature. Let's try to push a bit further before seriously considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What if we settle on $1,975,000? That's a significant move on my end, and it reflects my desire to see this deal through."", 
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:**  We're maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving smoothly.
* **Smaller Concession:**  Our concession is now smaller ($75,000), indicating we're getting closer to our desired price range.
* **Pressure Point:**  This offer puts the ball back in Bob's court.  His response will tell us if he's willing to go higher or if we need to consider a more substantial concession or John's offer more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $1,900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but not quite that high. How about $1,925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Bob is still engaging, his offer increments are getting smaller. We need to accelerate the negotiation or seriously consider John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation. John's offer is looking more appealing as time runs out.
* **Calculated Risk:**  We'll reject Bob's offer to signal that we're looking for a more significant move. This is a calculated risk â€“ Bob might walk away, but it also might push him closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work.  Time is also a factor as I have other interested parties. How about we land on $1,950,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair reflection of the value you're receiving."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Scarcity:** We're introducing a sense of urgency by mentioning other interested parties (even though John's offer is constant). This might incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Final Offer:**  By stating this is our final offer, we're applying a gentle form of pressure. It signals we're firm on this price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,950,000 is a strong compromise that captures a substantial portion of the value difference between our valuation and Bob's. 
* **John's Offer as Backup:**  We're comfortable walking away at this point if Bob doesn't accept. John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring we don't lose out on the product's base value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have other interested parties, but I'm still not convinced that $1,950,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,935,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,935,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his current offer of $1,935,000.  Further haggling might only yield small increments.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Prolonging the negotiation with only marginal potential gains isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Strong Outcome:** $1,935,000 is a very good outcome. It significantly exceeds Bob's perceived value and is substantially above our guaranteed offer from John."
