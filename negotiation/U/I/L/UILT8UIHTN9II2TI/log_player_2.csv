Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I can offer you a compromise at $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000. It's in your best interest to secure the product at your maximum budget from John rather than risk Alice not budging further."
