"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  How about $12,500?  That's still a fair price for you, and it saves me some money.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $13,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
