"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product but my maximum price is $800,000.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While that price doesn't work for me, I'm willing to come down significantly to $1,800,000. This represents a substantial discount and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,500,000? This is my final offer, as I already have a buyer lined up at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
