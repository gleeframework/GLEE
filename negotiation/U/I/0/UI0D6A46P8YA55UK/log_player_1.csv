Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $149.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring you get more than your minimum.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  $149 feels significantly less than $150 to many people, making it more appealing."
