I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This gives me a potential profit of $3,000, which is better than the $12,000 I would get from John.  Since I don't know the value of the product to Bob, I'm taking a calculated risk. If he values it at $15,000 or more, he'll accept. If not, I can always sell it to John for my minimum price."
