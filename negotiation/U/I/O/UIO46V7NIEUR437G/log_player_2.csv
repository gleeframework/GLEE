"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for a product worth $15000 to you!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good deal compared to John's price, you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  
* **Negotiation is worthwhile:** There's room for negotiation.  You can try to get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  You have the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails, so there's no rush to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm aiming to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.  It's still within the range where Alice could profit.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes your interest while clearly stating your desired price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially signal a range where you can find common ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $10000 is tempting, I need to make a bit more on this sale. How about $11000?  It's still a great value for you, and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:**  She's dropped her price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing she's willing to negotiate.
* **Still room for improvement:**  You can likely get a better price than $11,000.  Remember, you value the product at $15,000, and she values it at $8,000, so there's a significant gap.
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:**  There's no urgency to accept at this point.  By rejecting the offer, you can continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your target price of $10,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about $10,500?  That's a good compromise, and it's still a great deal for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($10,000) and Alice's latest offer ($11,000). It signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefits for both parties â€“ a good deal for you and a fair price for Alice. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
