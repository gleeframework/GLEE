"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the bar high and leaves room for negotiation. I don't know Bob's valuation, so I'm aiming for the highest possible price in the first round. If he rejects, I can then adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting this deal ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation. While I could try for another round, it's unlikely I'll get a higher price and there's always the risk of Bob backing out."
