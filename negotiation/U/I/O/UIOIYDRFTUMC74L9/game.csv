"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $150 for it. What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $150 is my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $170, but I'm still only comfortable paying $150.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell it to you for $165. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm still set on $150.  It's a fair price for the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",150.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll sell the product to you for $160. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",160.0,Alice,7,
