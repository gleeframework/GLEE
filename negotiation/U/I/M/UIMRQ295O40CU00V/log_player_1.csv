Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to push for a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  I believe this price reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $800,000, which would be $700,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my ideal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is $50,000 above the product's value to you. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to make one final counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise.  $775,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum.
