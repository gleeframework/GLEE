"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  I believe this price reflects both our needs.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $600,000 and $800,000, which would be $700,000. This is my final offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still not a viable price for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is $50,000 above the product's value to you. I think this is a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise.  $775,000 is still not a price that works for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. If we can't agree on this, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're at your minimum price, but I'm still not willing to pay $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is $15,000 above your minimum. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",785000.0,Bob,8,
