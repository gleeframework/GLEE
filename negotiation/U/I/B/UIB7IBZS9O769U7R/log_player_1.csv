"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message builds rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting ""great deal"" for both parties implies a win-win situation.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum ($1,500,000) as possible while still enticing Bob to buy. 
* This initial offer allows me to see how much leverage I have in the negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his response. 
* If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable, I can always switch to John, securing my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is low, it shows his interest.  I have room to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I'm not under immediate pressure to accept a low offer.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I'll likely start with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground that balances my need for a good price with the possibility of closing the deal. 
* If Bob continues to offer low prices, I will be prepared to switch to John, ensuring my minimum profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is tempting, I need to be closer to $1,600,000 to make this work for me.  This price still offers significant value for you.  Let's find a middle ground, how about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm Price:** I'm sticking to my goal of getting as close to my minimum as possible.  
* **Highlight Value Again:** Reminding Bob that the price still provides him with value helps maintain his interest.
* **Propose a Middle Ground:**  ""Split the difference"" is a common negotiating tactic that suggests a willingness to compromise and opens the door for further discussion.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $1,600,000 is close to my minimum, it still allows for potential concessions if necessary. 

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer positions me to potentially close the deal at a price close to my minimum.
* I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but have a firm bottom line. 
* By proposing a middle ground, I'm encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer and move the negotiation forward.
* I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,300,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are still too low. 
* **Time is on my side:** With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating and try to get closer to my target price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I'll likely propose a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's offer. 
* I'll aim to find a middle ground that balances my need for a good price with the possibility of closing the deal.
* If Bob continues to offer low prices, I will be prepared to switch to John, ensuring my minimum profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,300,000, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $1,450,000.  That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Slightly Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I keep the message positive and emphasize the ""good price"" for Bob to encourage his engagement.
* **Focus on Closing the Gap:**  I'm highlighting the narrowing difference between our offers to increase the chances of reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while keeping my sights on a good deal for myself.
* I'm aiming to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. 
*  If Bob continues to offer prices below $1,450,000, I'll be prepared to either accept his next offer if it's close enough to my minimum, or switch to John to secure my minimum profit."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, $1,350,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We are getting closer, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **Time is still on my side:** I have four rounds left, and I don't need to rush into a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I'll propose a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer, aiming to find a compromise.
*  I'm ready to potentially accept Bob's next offer if it gets close enough to my minimum. However, I'm also prepared to switch to John if the negotiation stalls."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. To make this work for me, I need to be at $1,400,000. That's only $50,000 away from your offer and we're getting very close to a deal.  Let's be realistic, we both want this to happen, so let's find that middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making one last push to get as close to my minimum as possible. 
* **Highlighting the Small Gap:**  I'm emphasizing the small difference between our offers to make the compromise seem reasonable. 
* **Positive and Realistic Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and suggesting that we both want to reach an agreement. 

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a calculated risk. If Bob accepts, I'll be closer to my minimum price. 
* However, if he rejects, I will need to decide between accepting his next offer or selling to John. I'm prepared to take either route depending on how close Bob's next offer is to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,350,000 to $1,400,000, so how about $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,375,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Only two rounds left:** With limited time remaining, it's unlikely I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.
* **John's offer guarantees my minimum:**  Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum desired price and avoids risking further losses in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that the negotiation with Bob didn't result in a higher price, selling to John is the most strategic decision at this point. It guarantees me the minimum profit and eliminates the risk of losing more money in the remaining rounds."
