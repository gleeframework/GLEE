Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 gives Alice leverage. Offering it to Bob for $14,000 creates a sense of urgency and value."
