Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't meet the $10,000 price point. My counteroffer would be $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your perspective, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $8,000 is a fair price considering my budget constraints. I'm unable to increase my offer beyond that. Thank you for understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems firm on his $8,000 offer. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as potential buyers, ensuring I at least make my minimum acceptable price."
