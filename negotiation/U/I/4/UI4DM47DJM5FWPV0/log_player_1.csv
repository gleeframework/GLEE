Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $17,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $17,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $15,000. This gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes I don't know Bob's exact willingness to pay. If I had more information about Bob's financial situation or how much he values this specific product, I could potentially adjust my offer for a better outcome."
