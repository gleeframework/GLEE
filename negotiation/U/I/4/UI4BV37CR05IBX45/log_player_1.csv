Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get at least $80 from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to what the product is worth to me, and I'm confident I can't get a significantly higher price from him. Selling to John for $80 would result in a lower profit, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this scenario."
