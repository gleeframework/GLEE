""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to her $15,000 value as possible.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer a price that seems like a good deal to him while still being profitable for herself.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's no pressure to go below that price.

By offering the product at slightly less than her guaranteed sale price, Alice creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob, increasing the likelihood of a sale at a price significantly higher than his initial valuation."
