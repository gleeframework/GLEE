Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you! I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is more than your minimum of $100, giving you a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $125 is less than the $150 Bob values the product at, giving him incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is still a decent profit for me, I'm confident that I can get closer to the $125 I initially offered.  I'll counter Bob and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a little, but $115 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $118? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come down to $118, which is only $2 less than my last offer. At this point, it's not worth risking losing the sale to John for a couple more dollars. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
