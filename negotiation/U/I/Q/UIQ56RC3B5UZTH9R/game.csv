"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is the highest price I can afford at this time.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,075,000, recognizing your constraints. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. My maximum offer remains at $1,050,000. I hope we can find a way to agree on a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
