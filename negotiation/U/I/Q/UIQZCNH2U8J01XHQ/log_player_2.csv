Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're really close now, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $120, as it's below my minimum price. I can offer you a slight premium at $125, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's unlikely Alice will go lower than $125. It's better to buy from John at $120 and avoid potentially overpaying."
