"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $750000 for it. Can we discuss further?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new counteroffer of $775000. Can we meet in the middle again?",775000.0,Bob,4,
