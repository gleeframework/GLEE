"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet the highest standards of quality and performance. Given its exceptional features and capabilities, we believe it is worth significantly more than its face value. Considering its true worth and the benefits it offers, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this product for $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still quite high.  As Bob, I want to try and get a better price. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  $850,000 is still higher than my counteroffer, and I have several rounds left to negotiate.  I will reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am proposing a counteroffer of $840000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions and acknowledges the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $840,000. While I'd prefer to get it lower,  it's a good price considering:

* It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.
* It's only $60,000 higher than my last counteroffer.
* We are nearing the middle ground.
* Buying from John would cost me $1,000,000.

This offer is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity.  I'll accept it and move on."
