"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value and rarity.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider a price of $11000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for this unique product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10500? I think that's a fair price for this product, considering its value and rarity.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider a price of $10800. This is the absolute lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for this unique product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
