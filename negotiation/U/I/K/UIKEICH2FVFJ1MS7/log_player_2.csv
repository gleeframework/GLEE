"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,500,000? This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,500,000, which is within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to either accept her next offer or buy from John.  At this point, accepting her offer is the safest and most efficient way to secure the product within your budget."
