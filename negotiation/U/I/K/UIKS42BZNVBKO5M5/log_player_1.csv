Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $220 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 220}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $140 is still a bit too high for me. Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm sensing you're really interested in this product and I want to make a deal. However, I need to get a fair price. How about $110? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate that offer, but I'm afraid $110 is still pushing my budget.  I could meet you at $80, but I couldn't go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than $80. Accepting his offer would be a loss compared to John's guaranteed $150.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
