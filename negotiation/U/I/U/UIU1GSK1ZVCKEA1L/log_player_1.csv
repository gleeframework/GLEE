Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,150,000. I know this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, potentially saving and generating significantly more for you in the long run. This is a one-time offer, are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a compelling discount.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message emphasizes the offer's limited-time nature and the product's unique value to Bob, encouraging him to act quickly.

By setting the price at $1,150,000, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, as it presents a significant benefit to him compared to his alternative options."
