Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly.  I think you'll find it very valuable. How does $130 sound?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is comfortably above your $100 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down a bit. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
