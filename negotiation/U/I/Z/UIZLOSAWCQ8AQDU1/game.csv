"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves you with a considerable profit margin.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be around $950,000 for this to work for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
