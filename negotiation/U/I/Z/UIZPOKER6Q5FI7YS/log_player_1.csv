"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($1,100,000) leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($800,000). 
* **Gauging Bob's Position:** This initial offer helps me understand how eager Bob is to buy and provides insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:** I keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $800,000, which acts as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Bob's willingness to pay this much shows strong interest. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but hold strong):** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down in price, but not drastically. This signals that I'm serious about selling at a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Targeting the Zone:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground within the range we've established ($900,000 - $1,100,000).
* **Maintaining Confidence:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress, and Bob is clearly still interested. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for at least $975,000. I'm willing to push the negotiation a bit further as we still have rounds to spare and Bob is showing a willingness to move upwards in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the immense value this product offers. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $985,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your strong interest."",
""product_price"": 985000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer splits the difference between his last offer ($950,000) and my previous ask ($1,025,000), but skews slightly in my favor. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm implying that this is a final offer while leaving room for one more potential counter if needed.
* **Positive Language:**  I continue to use positive language to encourage a deal while reinforcing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating he is willing to pay a premium for the product.
* **Limited Upside:** While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gain is minimal compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now secures a significant profit. Dragging out negotiations might not yield a much better outcome. 

$975,000 is a great price, and accepting now ensures a successful and profitable outcome."
