Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the maximum possible price. I know the product is worth $120 to me, and I don't want to sell it for less.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate, but I'll always have the option of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is still above my minimum but a little closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains some profit margin."
