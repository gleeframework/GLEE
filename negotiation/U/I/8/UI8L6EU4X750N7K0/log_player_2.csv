"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you. I am proposing to sell it to you at an exceptional price of $140, which is a special offer considering its original value. Don't miss out on this opportunity to own something truly remarkable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject her initial offer. You're aiming to save as much as possible, so it's worth seeing if she'll budge."
