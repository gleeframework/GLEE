"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,200,000 to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
