{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation in the middle ground. It gives Bob a good deal, but it also secures a profit for me. If he rejects, I can make a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I'm looking for. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  How about $8,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's more than what I'd get from John and is closer to my initial asking price. It's time to close the deal."
