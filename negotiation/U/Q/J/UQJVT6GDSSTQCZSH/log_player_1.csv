{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is:

* **Higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you get at least what you need.
* **Lower than Bob's estimated value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **A strong starting point:** It establishes a clear price point and allows for potential counter-offers.

This strategy balances getting a good price with keeping the negotiation open for a possible win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter Bob's offer and aim for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1375000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,325,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a good compromise and still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also important to consider that further negotiations might lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of a less favorable outcome."
