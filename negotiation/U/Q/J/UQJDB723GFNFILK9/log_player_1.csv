"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of its worth. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob, as it's unlikely he'll go higher. It's best to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
