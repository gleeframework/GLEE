,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $800,000.  Do you think we can work with that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show my commitment to finding common ground, I can go down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you say that is your final offer, but I'm finding it hard to agree. I could potentially stretch to $1,400,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
