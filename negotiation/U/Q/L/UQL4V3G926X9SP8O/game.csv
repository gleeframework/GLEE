"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. It's a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $950000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a new offer of $920000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $920000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $930000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $930000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920000 and $930000, so I'll offer $925000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925000.
