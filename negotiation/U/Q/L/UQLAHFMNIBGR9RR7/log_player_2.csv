Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I'm willing to sell the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's still significantly above John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go below $800,000 in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John at the guaranteed best price."
