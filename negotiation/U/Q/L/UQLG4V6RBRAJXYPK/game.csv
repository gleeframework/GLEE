"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise considering our initial discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a specific price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,325,000 as a compromise.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,280,000, but I think that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm confident that this price still reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
