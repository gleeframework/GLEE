"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $7000 for the product.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. This is a fair price considering the product's unique value. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8200 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we settle on $7500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also giving us both a good deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000. However, I'm willing to throw in a special bonus package worth $200 to sweeten the deal. This package includes a premium warranty and a personalized consultation to help you get the most out of the product. With this offer, the total price would be $8200. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the bonus offer, but I'm focused on getting the best price for the product itself.  I'm still willing to pay $7700 for it, without the added extras. This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",7700.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your focus on the product's price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $8000. However, I'm willing to consider a small discount. I'll meet you halfway between $7700 and $8000. I'll sell the product to you for $7900. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",7900.0,Alice,7,
