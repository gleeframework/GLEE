"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a significantly lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob is aiming for the lowest price possible and knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John. He'll start with the target price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is better than her initial price, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

Bob is offering $9,000, which is a compromise between his target price of $8,000 and Alice's last offer of $10,000.  He's hoping to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down to $9,500, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. John is offering the product for his target price of $8,000, so there's no reason to keep trying to bargain with Alice."
