"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She claims she'll sell the product for less than its worth to her if you reject the offer. This doesn't make logical sense. You can call her bluff by rejecting the offer.  You'll likely get a better deal from her in a subsequent round, or you can buy from John for $1,500,000."
