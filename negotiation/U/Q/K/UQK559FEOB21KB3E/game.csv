"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $950,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $810,000 for the product.",810000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $880,000? This feels like a fair price that reflects the value you'll be gaining.",880000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still need to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $820,000? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my financial limits.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but need to stay above $850,000 to make this deal worthwhile on my end. Would you consider $855,000?",855000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand the value of the product and your position. Could we meet at $840,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",840000.0,Bob,6,
