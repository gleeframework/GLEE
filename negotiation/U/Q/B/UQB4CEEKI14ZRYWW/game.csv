"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,400,000 is lower than my initial price, it's not quite what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on that, I'll take the product right now.  Let me know if you're open to that.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
