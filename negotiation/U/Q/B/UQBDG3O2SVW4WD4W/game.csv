"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to pursue further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1000000. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you at $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my financial constraints. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, at $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
