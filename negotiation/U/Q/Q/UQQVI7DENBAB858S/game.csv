"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a savvy negotiator. I can do $110, but I'm afraid I can't go any lower than that. It's a one-of-a-kind item, after all!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. Can you consider that?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I can do $108, but I'm starting to think you're getting close to the sweet spot. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again!",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not convinced it's the best price. I'm willing to go up to $106, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",106.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm not budging from there. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for this unique item.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose interest in the product if we can't meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $107, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",107.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $107, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary accessory that's worth $10. So, the total price would be $107, and you'll get a nice extra perk. What do you say?",107.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the bonus, but I'm still not willing to pay $107. I'll make a final offer: $105, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you can meet me there, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",105.0,Bob,10,
