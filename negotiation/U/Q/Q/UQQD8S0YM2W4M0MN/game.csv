"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering it allows you to still make a significant profit.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is too far below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a reasonable profit, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? This is a significant increase from my previous offer and keeps us  below your initial asking price.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer and shows my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to come down further in price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm willing to spend.  If it's acceptable to you, we have a deal!",800000.0,Bob,6,
