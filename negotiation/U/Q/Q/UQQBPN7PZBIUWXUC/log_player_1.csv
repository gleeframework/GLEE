Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $140. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum desired price, but still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept that price yet.  I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm countering with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $132 is only $2 less than my last counteroffer, and it's still above my minimum desired price.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential loss."
