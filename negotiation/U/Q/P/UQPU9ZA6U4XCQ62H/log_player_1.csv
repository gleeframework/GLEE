Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $14,000, considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going in with a price too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a good deal and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright.

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming to secure the best possible deal with Bob while keeping the safety net of John's offer in mind."
