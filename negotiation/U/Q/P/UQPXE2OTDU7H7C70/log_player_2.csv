Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to consider the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make another adjustment, but I need to stay close to my original target. I'm offering you a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that reflects the product's value while also showing my flexibility. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise, and it's within your budget. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price, saving you money compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly lower price, and the risk of Alice walking away or you missing out on the product isn't worth it at this point."
