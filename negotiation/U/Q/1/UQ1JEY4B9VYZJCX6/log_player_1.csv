Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000 and our minimum acceptable price is also $12,000, starting with a higher offer of $15,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value to justify the higher price without explicitly revealing our bottom line. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer allows us to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay. If he outright rejects $15,000, we can consider a lower offer closer to $12,000 knowing John provides a safety net."
