"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that benefits us both. I'd like to start the negotiations at $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth $1,000,000 to her, and she's asking $1,400,000.  It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  I can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would still be a significant profit for you and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $1,200,000 is a substantial sum, I'm confident this product's unique value warrants a higher investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter again, but I'm also getting close to my upper limit.  If Alice doesn't budge, I'll likely have to consider buying from John."
