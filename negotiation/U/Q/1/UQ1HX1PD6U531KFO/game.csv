"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. However, I am interested in discussing a potential compromise. Would you consider selling the product for $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is still a little below what I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my goal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
