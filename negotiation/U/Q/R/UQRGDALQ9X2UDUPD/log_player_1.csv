Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing you above your minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message hints at the product's value and the ""exclusive opportunity,"" potentially making Bob more inclined to consider the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

*  This strategy assumes you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer.
*  Observing Bob's reaction and being prepared to slightly adjust your price during the negotiation could be beneficial."
