"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm looking to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's still above your desired maximum of $150. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and a decent deal. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the product to another buyer or ending up paying the higher price from John.  It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product."
