"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This takes into account your offer, and it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $12500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,
