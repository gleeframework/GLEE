"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're aiming to save as much as possible. While $1,200,000 is under our limit, there's room to negotiate and try to get closer to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $900,000 to make a deal work."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with an aggressive counteroffer significantly below Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Not Too Low:**  While we want a good deal, going too low might insult Alice and make her less willing to negotiate. $900,000 leaves a decent margin for both sides.
* **Gauge Her Reaction:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is on price and what we can realistically expect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still above John's price.  We need to signal that we're serious about the lower price range.  Let's see if we can negotiate further before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're showing willingness to move but in smaller increments. This keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much ground.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach can be psychologically effective.  By suggesting a compromise right between our previous offer and hers, it feels like a ""fair deal"" to both parties.
* **Keeping John in Mind:** We're getting closer to our walk-away point. We need to decide if we're willing to pay a premium to potentially close the deal with Alice in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for. I can do $1,075,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly anchored above $1,050,000. Her latest offer is a very small concession and shows she's unlikely to move significantly closer to our desired price.  We've made progress, but it's not worth risking a worse deal by continuing.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000, which is better than what Alice is currently offering.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the sure thing."
