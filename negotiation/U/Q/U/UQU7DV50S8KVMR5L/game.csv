"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you think $1,500,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. However,  $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we try $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,000,000, the minimum I'm willing to accept? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to give you a discount from the original offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
