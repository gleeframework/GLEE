"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course, as I believe a mutually beneficial agreement is within reach.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,100,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to work within your budget, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go a bit higher, but $1,225,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  How about $1,150,000? That would be a good compromise and I'm confident it would be a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
