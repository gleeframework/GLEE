"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of the product's high value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, I'm setting an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even though it's negotiable, this initial high price can influence his perception of a ""fair"" counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While John offers my minimum acceptable price, my goal is to maximize profit. By starting negotiations high with Bob, I keep the option of accepting John's offer open if negotiations don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is my top price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is higher than his perceived value, indicating potential for a better deal. While selling to John is an option, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm making a significant concession to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.  
* **Maintaining Value Perception:** The new price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's high value in his mind.
* **Gradual Negotiation:** I'm aiming for a gradual descent in price, leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is significantly higher than both his perceived value ($800,000) and John's standing offer ($1,000,000). 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Bob's language indicates a firm stance, making it unlikely he'll go much higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving me with John's lower offer. Accepting now secures a substantial profit."
