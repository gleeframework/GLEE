"I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $15,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know your decision.",15000.0,Alice,5,
