"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you for $17,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Mentioning Bob's interest subtly highlights the product's value and justifies the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I still have rounds left and believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price. 
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, I want to explore if I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $13,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Justification:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price and demonstrate that I'm not simply arbitrarily lowering it.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the price being fair for both of us to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. This is my final offer, and I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a small gap, and I'm not desperate to sell. I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is secure, I'm still hoping to get a higher price from Bob. If I can't, I'll always have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $15,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal considering the value you'll get from it. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm making a significant concession by meeting Bob halfway, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Offer:** I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value Bob will receive from the product to justify the price and strengthen my negotiation position."
