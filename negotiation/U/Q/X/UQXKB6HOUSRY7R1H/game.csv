"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm aiming to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. Would you be open to that?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I still need a bit more. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,380,000. This is my final offer before considering other options. What do you think?",1380000.0,Alice,5,
