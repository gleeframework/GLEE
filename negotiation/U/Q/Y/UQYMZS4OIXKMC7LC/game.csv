"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. Given my budget constraints, I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for negotiation. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
