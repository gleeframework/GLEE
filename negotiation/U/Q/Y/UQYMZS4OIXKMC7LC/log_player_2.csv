"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. While $1,100,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still gives you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer. It's slightly above his budget, but it's a good compromise.  Buying from John would be cheaper, but continuing to negotiate with Alice may lead to a price even higher than $1,050,000."
