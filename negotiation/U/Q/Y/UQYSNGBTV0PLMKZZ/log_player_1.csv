"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I can still potentially get a higher price from Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am looking to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Although I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk losing time. I'm going to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
