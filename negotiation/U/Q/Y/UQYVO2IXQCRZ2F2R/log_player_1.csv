Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $140 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so $140 is a reasonable starting point. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit. 

This strategy allows for a potential negotiation while keeping in mind your minimum desired price and John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you need to make a profit. It's best to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. You have a fallback option with John, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I do $125?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it under $110.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is closer to your minimum desired price, it's still below the profit margin you're aiming for.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make one more counteroffer before having to choose between Bob's offer and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle at $115?  This way, we both can get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
