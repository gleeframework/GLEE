"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $140 for it, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation to get closer to my $120 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.  While this offer is unlikely to be accepted outright, it sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could land on a price agreeable to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I do $125?  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice met me halfway, $125 is still above my ideal price. I'll try to negotiate a bit further, aiming for something closer to $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it under $110.  Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm inching closer to my maximum while still leaving room for Alice to potentially counter. By staying firm but polite, I'm hoping to secure a price I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price.  $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we settle at $115?  This way, we both can get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** At $115, Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise. It's within my budget and saves me $5 compared to John's price. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome, and I risk losing the opportunity if I push too hard."
