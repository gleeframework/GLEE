Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  It's worth a significant amount to both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John.  This allows her to start with a significantly higher offer.
* **Justification:** The message doesn't just throw out a number. It uses language like ""true value"" and ""potential"" to frame the price as an investment opportunity rather than just a cost.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate. This is often better than starting too low and limiting potential profit.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:**  If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, she might adjust her initial offer slightly lower. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, Alice might start with a slightly less aggressive offer.

This initial offer aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while still giving Bob a reason to consider the deal."
