"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point closer to $900,000. Would you be open to $925,000?"", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your target price is $900,000, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $925,000, which is $1,012,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice seems firmly planted above $1,000,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at your target price. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice."
