{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's buying price ($119) creates a sense of a deal for Bob while still securing a profit above Bob's perceived value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale and maximizing the potential profit."
