"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $8,500? This gives us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $7,000 is the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit. While I'd love to seal the deal, $7,000 just doesn't work for me. Let's try $8,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
