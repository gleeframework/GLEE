"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a very fair price.  Would you be interested in paying $120 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you can get the product for $150 from John, Alice's offer of $120 is still a better deal for you. It saves you $30 compared to buying from John. Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, you are getting it for $120, which is still within your budget of $150."
