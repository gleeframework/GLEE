"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $70 is just too low for me.  How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit higher than $85, how about $75? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay under $80",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? That way we both get what we want.",80.0,Alice,5,
