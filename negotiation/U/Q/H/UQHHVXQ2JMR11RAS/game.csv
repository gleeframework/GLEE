"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,500.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. After reviewing the market and considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair compromise and  a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a very good price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
