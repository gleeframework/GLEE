Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below my minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Profit:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
