"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $10,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $1,500. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
