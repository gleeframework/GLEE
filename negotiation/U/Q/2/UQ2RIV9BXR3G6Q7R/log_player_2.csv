"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As the seller, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $15,000, Bob can likely do better.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $10,000, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best initial strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you see in this product.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $10,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is closer to Bob's preferred price, it's still above his maximum. He has 7 rounds left and can still buy from John for $10,000, so rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $10,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer of $10,500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $1,500. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still very close to his maximum price point.  He has 5 rounds left and can still buy from John for $10,000. It's likely that Alice will continue to lower her price, so Bob should reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still confident that $10,500 is a fair price for this product. It's the best I can offer right now. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns on the price, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very close to his maximum price point. However, he still has 4 rounds left and can still buy from John for $10,000. It's likely that Alice will continue to lower her price to make the deal. Bob should reject this offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get to $10,500. Let's split the difference and close this deal at $10,625. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get to $10,500, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not going any lower. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in this product and meet me at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round. While Alice has lowered her price to $10,700, which is only $700 above Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  Bob has already made several counteroffers and is likely at the end of his negotiating leverage.  It's best for him to accept John's offer of $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
