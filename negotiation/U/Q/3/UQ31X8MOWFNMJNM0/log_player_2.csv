Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1400000?  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to make a good deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1000000. This represents a substantial compromise from my initial asking price, but it also ensures a fair value for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This represents a significant concession on my part and leaves us both with a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000. While Alice has come down in price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He's already made a final counteroffer, and there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer. 

It's better to be certain and secure the product from John at his price."
