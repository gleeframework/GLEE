You should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth more to her than to you, so there is room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

You should reject Alice's offer again. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely negotiate further and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You're very close to your maximum price, and while you could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Alice will refuse and you'll end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000.  This offer gets you a slightly better price than buying from John, making it the best option."
