"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This gives you a significant discount and is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $750,000 is still too low. I've already come down significantly from my initial asking price. To make this deal work, I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you'll agree that it's a win-win for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
