Alice's offer:

To make this deal work, I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. I hope you'll agree that it's a win-win for both of us.

While Alice is coming down, it's clear she's aiming for a price higher than John's $800,000 offer. There's no guarantee she'll go that low, so it's more strategic to take John's deal and secure the product at the best possible price."
