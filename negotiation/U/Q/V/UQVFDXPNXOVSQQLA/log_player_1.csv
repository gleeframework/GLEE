``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets a strong baseline for further negotiations.  I'm confident I can achieve a price closer to my desired value, but it's important to be flexible and assess Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll need to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to sell for so far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This gives you a significant discount and is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a ways off. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not high enough. I'm not willing to sell for less than $900,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a final counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $750,000 is still too low. I've already come down significantly from my initial asking price.

I hope you'll agree that it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
