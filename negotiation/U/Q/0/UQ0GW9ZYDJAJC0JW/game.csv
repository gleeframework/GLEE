,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than $700,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $950,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase.",825000.0,Bob,4,
