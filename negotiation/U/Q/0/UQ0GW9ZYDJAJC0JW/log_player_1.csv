Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product is worth more, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $825,000. I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

Bob is now offering more than John. It's a good deal and there's no guarantee I can get more out of Bob in the remaining rounds."
