"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's try $92.50.  That's a good midpoint between our last offers and we can both get what we want. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, but $92 is still a bit below what I can do.  Let's try $98. That's a fair price considering the quality of the product and its value to you.  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement here.",98.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $98 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $88. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",88.0,Bob,8,
