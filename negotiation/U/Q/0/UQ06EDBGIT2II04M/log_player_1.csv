I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept my offer."

You have three options:

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $11,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway. I'm still hopeful he'll see the value in the product and accept this offer."
