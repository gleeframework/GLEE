Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good profit while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than the $12,000 value he places on the product, meaning he can still make a good profit.
* **Good Profit for You:**  You'll earn $2,000 more than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

This strategy is based on the assumption that Bob is rational and will prioritize his own potential profit.  There's always a risk he might reject the offer, but offering a price closer to his value increases his likelihood of accepting."
