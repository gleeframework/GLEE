"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which I think is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle!",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,800 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,600 for the product, which is a fair price considering I can get it for $10,000 elsewhere.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",10600.0,Bob,4,
