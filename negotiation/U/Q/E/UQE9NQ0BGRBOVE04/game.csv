,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $14000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16000.  This still leaves room for us both to get a good price, but it also reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15500. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me.",15500.0,Bob,4,
