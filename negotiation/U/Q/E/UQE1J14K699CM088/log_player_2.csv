"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay $150 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal from someone else."
