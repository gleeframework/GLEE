"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. To start negotiations, I propose a selling price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is certainly tempting, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,175,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence but the concessions you're asking for are getting too large. I'm willing to make one final move to  $1,200,000.  This is absolutely my best offer. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options for selling the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
