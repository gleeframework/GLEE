Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:**  Since the product's value is $8,000 to both you and Bob, starting higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Creating a sense of value and urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer""  add perceived value and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is for $10,000, there's a possibility Bob might negotiate, and you can potentially meet in the middle. 

You have a safety net with John's offer, so aiming slightly higher with Bob is a strategic move."
