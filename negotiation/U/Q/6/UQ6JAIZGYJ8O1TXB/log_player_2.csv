"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value to her ($150), it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget ($80) and what John offers you ($80). You can do better by rejecting this offer."
