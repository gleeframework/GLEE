Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth in the current market. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, I need to offer Bob a price that's enticing but still significantly above John's offer. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts. He saves $50,000 compared to its actual worth to him, and I make a $150,000 profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, there might be some room for negotiation if Bob counters. However, I wouldn't go below $1,200,000 as I have John as a guaranteed buyer."
