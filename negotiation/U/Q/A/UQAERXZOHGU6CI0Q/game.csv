"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $8,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a premium for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I understand that's a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you and the value to me. Let me know if this works for you!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value to you and the value to me. Let me know if this works for you!",9250.0,Alice,5,
