"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. There's a good chance he can get a better deal than $1,400,000, especially since the product is only worth $1,000,000 to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $1,400,000. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you considering the potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate. He can likely get a better price than $1,300,000. Since Alice is willing to negotiate, it's worth exploring further to see if he can reach a deal closer to his desired price of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to come down to $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're driving a hard bargain! I understand the need to find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,275,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while still reflecting the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob can continue to negotiate, Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to his desired price of $1,200,000 and significantly less than the $1,500,000 he'd pay John.  Accepting this offer is the best option to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of a deal falling through."
