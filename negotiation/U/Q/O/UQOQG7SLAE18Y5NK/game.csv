"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a bit of a savvy shopper, and I've done my research on this product. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think, Alice?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $95, but no more than that. I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $102. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other buyers. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $100. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to meet you at $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other buyers.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made concessions, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $105. I'm willing to meet you at $99. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. Can you meet me at $99?",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $99, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to give up more. I'm willing to meet you at $101. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other buyers.",101.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $101. I'm willing to meet you at $98. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $120.",98.0,Bob,10,
