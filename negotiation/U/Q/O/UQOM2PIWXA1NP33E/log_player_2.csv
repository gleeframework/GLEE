Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above your maximum budget. While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. John offers the product for exactly your maximum budget, so it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
