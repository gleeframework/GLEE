"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see potential in this product, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and recognize your budget constraints. While $800000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also giving you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still above what I can afford. I'm happy to go up slightly from my previous offer.  How about $950000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
