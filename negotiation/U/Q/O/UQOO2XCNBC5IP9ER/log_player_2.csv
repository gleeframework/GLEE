Alice's offer is far above your budget. It makes sense to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and recognize your budget constraints. While $800000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000? This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also giving you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it is still higher than your budget. It is worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
