"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500. This reflects its value to me, and I'm confident we can find a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $11,000.
* **Potential Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Risk:**  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a lower price, there's also a risk Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.

**Conclusion:**  The $1,000 savings from accepting Alice's offer outweighs the potential for further negotiation, making it the most logical decision at this point."
