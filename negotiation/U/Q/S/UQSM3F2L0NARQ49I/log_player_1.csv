{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still significantly lower than what it's worth to me. It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to get closer to my ideal price of $10,000,  Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to accept his offer and move on."
