"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130.  This price is still fair for both of us. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. Let's see if we can close this.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $117.50? It's a fair price, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",117.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $117.50 is still a little too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $116. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal. Let's make it happen!",116.0,Bob,6,
