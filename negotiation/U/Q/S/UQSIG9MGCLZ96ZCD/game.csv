"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value it holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I feel this is a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.
