Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Offering the product at $2,250,000 (a 50% markup) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This initial high price leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob, bringing you closer to your desired outcome. 

**Important:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything. You can always negotiate down towards $1,500,000, knowing you have John as a backup buyer."
