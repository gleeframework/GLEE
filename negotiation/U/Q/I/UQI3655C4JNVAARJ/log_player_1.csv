"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a positive rapport with Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the ""great deal"" for both parties to emphasize the potential benefit for Bob.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and gradually lower the price if necessary. This allows me to potentially maximize my earnings while still giving Bob a chance to negotiate. If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer based on how close his offer is to my minimum acceptable price of $120. I also have the option to sell to John at any point if I feel the negotiation with Bob is not going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is below my desired range, it's a good sign he's interested in the product. This opens an opportunity for further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price by making a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, keeping in mind that I want to close the deal within the 10 rounds. I will also continue to monitor the possibility of selling to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? This would still be a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $105, which is significantly higher than Bob's $90 offer but still lower than my starting price of $110. 
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes my willingness to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the ""great deal"" aspect, highlighting the potential benefits for Bob to encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position. This approach aims to strike a balance between earning a reasonable profit and closing the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $105 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. I'd be willing to go up to $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it is closer, it is still not a financially viable option for me.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob is willing to increase his offer, it is still not at a point where I am comfortable selling. 
* **Opportunity for Higher Price:** I believe there is still potential to secure a higher price, given Bob's continued interest in the product.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to reject Bob's offers and aim for a higher price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round.  I will keep a close eye on the number of rounds remaining and consider selling to John if I feel the negotiation with Bob is not progressing towards a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $95.  While that's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, how about $100?  Let's close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $100 represents another compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Urgency and Closing:** The message conveys a sense of urgency by suggesting that we ""close this deal"". This subtly pressures Bob to accept my offer.
* **Fairness:** By offering to meet him halfway, I'm emphasizing that I'm still open to negotiating and finding a fair price for both of us.

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds left, I am trying to strike a balance between earning a decent profit and closing the deal. I believe $100 is a reasonable compromise that might be acceptable to Bob, given his increased offer. I will closely monitor his response and continue to negotiate if necessary. If Bob rejects this offer, I will consider selling to John in the next round as we are getting close to the end of the negotiation period."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'd be willing to go up to $98. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $98 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While he is getting closer, I am not yet comfortable accepting a price this low.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob's increased offer demonstrates his ongoing interest. I believe we can still reach a higher price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 4 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing. However, I still believe that I can get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to reject Bob's offers and make a counteroffer in the next round. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120. If Bob rejects my next offer, I will seriously consider selling to John in round 8."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to making a decision, and I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  I'm feeling very close to your price point. How about $99? It's a small step from your offer, and it would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $99, which is a small increase from Bob's $98 offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still getting me closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I emphasize the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept and signal my willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Time Pressure:** While I'm aware of the time pressure, I'm still pushing for a slightly higher price, hoping to secure a deal that's more favorable for me.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm attempting to close the deal with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm also mindful of the possibility of needing to sell to John if this offer is rejected.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable with $99. I'd be willing to go up to $97. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it is closer, it is still not a financially viable option for me.
* **Time Pressure:** With only two rounds left, the time pressure is increasing. I believe that there is little chance of Bob increasing his offer enough for me to make a profit. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees a profit of $120, which is well above my minimum acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

I am choosing to sell to John because I believe there is little chance of reaching a price with Bob that will be profitable for me. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit within the remaining two rounds."
