Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting high at $175, knowing the product is worth $150 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and trying to gauge Bob's interest by mentioning he'd love the product. This might encourage him to counteroffer. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** Explicitly stating I'm open to negotiation shows I'm willing to compromise, which can be helpful in getting Bob to counteroffer. 

**Strategy:** By starting high and showing willingness to negotiate, I aim to get Bob to counteroffer, potentially bringing the price closer to my desired range. If he doesn't counteroffer or his counteroffer is too low, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low. I'll counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125 for you. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $125, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150 but significantly lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for me.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating my stance on the value of the product. I'm also emphasizing the ""fair price"" aspect to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.

**Strategy:** By lowering my price slightly and emphasizing fairness, I'm aiming to get Bob closer to my desired price range. If he still rejects, I can always sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and meet at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it still falls below it.  Considering I can sell to John for $150, it's more profitable to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John instead.  Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a better price, and it's not worth the risk of potentially getting a lower offer or having the negotiation drag on."
