"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $850000, which is the same price I was initially offering. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my minimum requirements.",850000.0,Alice,5,
