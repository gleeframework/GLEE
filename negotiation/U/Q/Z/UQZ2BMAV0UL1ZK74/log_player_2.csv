Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $7,200 again? I know I offered it to you in round 5, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $7,200.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll budge significantly. John offers the product for $8,000. Buying from John saves us $200 and avoids further negotiation rounds."
