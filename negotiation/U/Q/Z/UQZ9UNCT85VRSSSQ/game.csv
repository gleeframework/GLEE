"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000,  which is a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to an agreement.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,500?  I think this is a fair price that takes both of our needs into consideration.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which is the same price I offered earlier. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",9500.0,Bob,8,
