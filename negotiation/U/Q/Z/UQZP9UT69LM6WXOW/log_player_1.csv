{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $10,000. It's a real steal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving us room to negotiate. We want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can then adjust our offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable to me, and while I would prefer to earn more, selling to John for the same price would be equally profitable.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
