"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  It's worth negotiating further with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This counteroffer is likely to be appealing to Alice as it still leaves her with a profit of $2,000, which is better than selling to John and getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price point. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price point.  $10,500 is a compromise, offering Alice a profit of $2,500. It's likely to be attractive to her, especially if she doesn't want to risk losing the sale to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $11,000 is within his budget and provides a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, especially with only five rounds remaining. It's a good compromise to accept and finalize the purchase."
