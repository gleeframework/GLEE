"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could we settle around $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit above your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to consider $750,000? That's a significant price jump on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the price down, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
