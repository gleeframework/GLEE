Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}

This offer starts at a price that is higher than what I would accept from John, but still leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob.  It also sets a clear expectation of value for the product."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I can likely get more from Bob. I will counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price to $110. This shows flexibility while still maintaining a margin above my minimum."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $105 is better than my minimum and  a reasonable compromise.  It also saves time and avoids further negotiations."
