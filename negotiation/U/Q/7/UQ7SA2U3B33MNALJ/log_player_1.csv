Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net. It means Alice doesn't have to settle for anything less.
* **Psychology:**  By anchoring the initial offer high, Alice sets a tone that the product is highly valuable. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows Alice has a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, this strategy is less likely to be successful."
