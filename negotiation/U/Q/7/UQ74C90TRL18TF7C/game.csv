"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a great value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
