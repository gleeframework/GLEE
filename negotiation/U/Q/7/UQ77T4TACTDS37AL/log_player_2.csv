"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a small profit while still offering you a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not interested in paying $10,500 when I can buy the same product from John for $10,000.
