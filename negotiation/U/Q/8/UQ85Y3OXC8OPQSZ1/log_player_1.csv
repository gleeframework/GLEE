Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $100 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for some potential bargaining. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above your minimum acceptable price of $80. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and a profit that is higher than selling to John."
