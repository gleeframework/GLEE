"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$900,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can definitely do better. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  Offering $700,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. It's also well below Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000, giving him some buffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer and still above Bob's desired price point.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before considering buying from John. There's still room for Alice to lower her price and for Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing willingness to compromise. $750,000 is still a good deal for him, and it might be enough to convince Alice to close the deal.  It's important to remember that Bob has 6 rounds left before he needs to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her offer, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob has time and should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. If he rejects, he can make another counteroffer and hopefully find a price that works for both of them.  The risk is that Alice may become less willing to negotiate in the later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price point but still trying to save money. $800,000 is a good compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, as it's her minimum selling point.  At this point, Bob is running out of rounds, so it's important to find a deal before he has to consider John's offer."
