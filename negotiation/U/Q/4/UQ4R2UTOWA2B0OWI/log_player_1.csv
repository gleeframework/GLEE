Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $115.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $105?  I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point.  I'll try to counter with a price that's more appealing to both of us in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at that price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $107.50 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you! I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. How about we try $109?  It's only a little bit higher than your last offer, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 109}
