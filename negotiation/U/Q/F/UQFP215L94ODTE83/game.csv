"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this work.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
