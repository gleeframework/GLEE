{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. I've kept in mind that I have a backup buyer, John, willing to pay more, which gives me some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is a more comfortable price for me, and I'm willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a good deal for Bob, it is significantly less than my minimum asking price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this work.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum asking price of $1,500,000. I'll reject his offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if Bob continues to insist on a price that's too low, I'll sell the product to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,050,000. I think that's the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $1,050,000. While I'd love to make a deal with Bob, I can't afford to sell for such a low price. My minimum asking price was $1,500,000, and John is willing to pay that. It's better to take a guaranteed sale with John and secure my desired profit than continue negotiating with Bob and risk losing out on a profitable deal."
