Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate a slightly lower price.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is still significantly above Alice's minimum of $10,000, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down.

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic chance of securing a deal with Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer."
