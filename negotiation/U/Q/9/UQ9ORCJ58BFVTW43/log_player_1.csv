Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I think a starting price of $14,000 feels fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However,  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
