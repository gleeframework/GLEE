"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,600,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential it holds for your company.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000 for your product. This is a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it would be beneficial for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,400,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,450,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
