Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your proposal, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider reducing the price? I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,200,000 by continuing negotiations with Bob."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not at the level I need to make this deal worthwhile. I believe there's still room for negotiation and am not willing to settle for less than my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to stay closer to $950,000 to make this deal work for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $937,500?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not at the level I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  However, if we can't reach an agreement soon, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm willing to come down to $935,000.  This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 935000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget considerations and the value I see in this product, I would like to propose $932,500 as a fair price for the transaction.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $932,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  We are close to an agreement, but I'm getting nervous about running out of rounds.  While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, it's more important for me to secure a sale.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
