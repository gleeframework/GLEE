Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Interests:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect, highlighting the potential savings for Bob.
* **Setting a Deadline (Implicitly):**  I'm mentioning that I could get a higher price elsewhere, creating a sense of urgency. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintain leverage:** By mentioning other potential buyers, I'm reminding Bob that he has limited time to make a decision.
* **Open the door for negotiations:** The offer is designed to start a conversation, allowing me to adjust my price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save even more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,000,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the leverage of potentially selling to John for a much higher price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, it's a starting point for further negotiation. 

I will counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still lower than what John is offering. This keeps the negotiation going while ensuring I don't settle for an unacceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Showing Flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own financial goals.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** The price is still higher than Bob's offer, reminding him that he has to make concessions to close the deal.
* **Setting a clear expectation:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,050,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to further concessions, potentially lowering the price to an unacceptable level.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible price, ensuring I achieve my financial goals.

While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to prioritize my own interests and ensure I get a fair return on my product. Selling to John is the best option in this situation."
