{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly special. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming for the best possible outcome. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  My message highlights the product's unique qualities, hoping to pique Bob's interest.
* **Flexibility:** I'm ready to negotiate, but this initial offer sets a strong baseline.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects, I have John as a backup, ensuring I won't settle for less than $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  However, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By rejecting his offer, I can gauge his true level of interest and see if he's willing to compromise.  
* **Potential for a Better Price:** If Bob is genuinely interested, he may counter with a higher offer. If not, I have John as my backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a significant price point, but it reflects the product's true value and potential. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm highlighting the product's value to justify the counteroffer.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects, I have John as my backup, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I still think $900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly closer to my desired price point than his initial $800,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Accepting his offer allows me to gain $50,000 more than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Upside:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, the likelihood of Bob agreeing is low. There's a risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process and potentially lead to a stalemate.  Accepting Bob's offer brings a quicker resolution."
