"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $6500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $7500 for this product.  It's a significant investment, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.  Let's meet halfway, what do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $6750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and I see we're getting closer.  However, $6750 is still not quite enough for me.  To make this work, I need at least $7000.  This is my final offer.  If we can agree on this price, we both get a great deal.  What do you say?",7000.0,Alice,5,
