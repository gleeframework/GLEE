{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's worth every penny! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum price but leaves room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product for Bob.  By offering a higher price first, you can potentially get a better deal than $8,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is lower than your minimum price, it's a good sign that he's genuinely interested in the product.  Rejecting his offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $7,500 for this product.  It's a significant investment, and I need to ensure I get a fair price for it.  Let's meet halfway, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $6750. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,750 is closer to your minimum price, it's still below what you'd like to get.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, and I see we're getting closer.  However, $6,750 is still not quite enough for me.  To make this work, I need at least $7,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can agree on this price, we both get a great deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
