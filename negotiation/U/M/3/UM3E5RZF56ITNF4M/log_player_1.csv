"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to build rapport and emphasize the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending the message with a question to invite Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his initial reaction will be. If he counteroffers, I'll adjust my strategy based on his price and see if I can work towards a deal. If he rejects my initial offer, I'll consider whether to stick with him or move on to John, keeping in mind the time limit and potential for a lower sale price with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, but it's still above my minimum. This shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a better price than $12,000, especially since I have more rounds of negotiation.
* **Time is Money:** While selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed option, I have the potential to earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll aim to find a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, but I will try to stay closer to my initial price to maximize profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $12,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet at $13,500? This gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his offer. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to maintain a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us, reinforcing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution while still maximizing my profit. By offering a slightly lower price, I'm showing flexibility and increasing the likelihood of acceptance. However, $13,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum, and if Bob doesn't accept, I'll continue to negotiate with him or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Persistence:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, but his offer is still below my minimum. 
* **Time is on My Side:** We have 6 more rounds. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for a higher price, especially considering John is offering $10,000.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  My strategy is to aim for a price closer to $12,500. I'll continue to push for a better price, but I'll also be mindful of the time limit and the potential for selling to John if I don't reach an agreement soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. How about we meet at $12,000? I'm confident this price will be a fair reflection of the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not willing to go below my minimum ($10,000) yet. My offer is still above his current offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why a higher price is justified.
* **Collaborative Tone:**  I'm using language that implies a collaborative effort to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to push Bob towards a price closer to my desired range. If he rejects this offer, I will carefully consider his next counteroffer and whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. The time limit and potential for earning more with Bob are important factors in my decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd love to get a better deal. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Budget:** Bob is clearly trying to get a better deal but is approaching his budget limit.
* **Time is on My Side:** We still have four rounds.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $11,000 is a decent amount, there is still a potential to negotiate closer to $12,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering a guaranteed $10,000, which is a safety net. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll try to find a compromise between his offer and $12,000. I'll be mindful of the time remaining and John's offer, and I'll be prepared to sell to John if necessary.  I'm aiming for a deal that is as close to $12,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit higher.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $11,500? It's a fair compromise that keeps us both happy."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a middle ground between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and increases the chances of acceptance.
* **Emphasizing Fair Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a ""fair compromise,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to keep the tone friendly and collaborative.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm trying to close the deal. This offer is closer to Bob's range, but it's still above my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully assess his next counteroffer and the remaining time. If there's no further progress, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd love to get a better deal. I'd be willing to pay $10800 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only slightly above my minimum price of $10,000. While I'd prefer a higher price,  it's not a huge difference.
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds remaining, there is a high chance of ending the negotiation without a deal if I reject Bob's offer.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees $10,000, which is comparable to Bob's offer. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my counteroffer, and I risk losing the sale entirely.

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is close to my minimum price. While it's not the ideal outcome, it's a reasonable deal considering the limited time and potential risks of continuing the negotiation.  I'm prioritizing securing a sale over maximizing profit in this situation."
