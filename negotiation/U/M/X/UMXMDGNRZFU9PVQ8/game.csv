"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
