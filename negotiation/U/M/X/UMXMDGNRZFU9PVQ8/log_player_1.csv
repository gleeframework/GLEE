"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it might take a while to reach a price I find acceptable. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than Bob's current offer and saves me time and potential negotiation fatigue."
