"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but the price is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,5,
