"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair profit, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000.  This price is within my budget and would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
