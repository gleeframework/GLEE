"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. Considering its value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.",8200.0,Alice,5,
