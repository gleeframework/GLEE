Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer that I think is reasonable, given the value of the product to me. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $2,000,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $2,000,000. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I don't think $1,000,000 is a good deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob. Let's see if I can get closer to the product's true value.

{""product_price"": $1,800,000}

I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Let's see what he thinks!"
