Round 2

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $15,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I could go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to go above $12,000.  It's time to cut the losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
