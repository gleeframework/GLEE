"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a budget. Can we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,750 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250. It's a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,250, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7,500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can we meet in the middle at $7,750 is not an option, so how about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
