Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm also aiming to build rapport with Bob by being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $135 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $125. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
