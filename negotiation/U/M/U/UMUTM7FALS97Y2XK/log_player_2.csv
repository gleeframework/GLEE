"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $2,300,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is truly significant.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $2,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and trying to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,850,000.  This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While the product is worth a premium, I value a swift deal. How about $1,925,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget.  While continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds is too high.  At this point, buying from John for $1,500,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
