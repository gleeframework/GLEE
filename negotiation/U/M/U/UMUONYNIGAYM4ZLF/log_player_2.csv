"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get an even lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,000.** This is still a good deal for Bob, as he can buy the product for $2,000 less than what John is offering.
* **Rejecting and making another counteroffer is risky.** There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price.  
* **Buying from John for $15,000 is the most expensive option.**

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
