Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'll try to get as close to that price as possible while still earning a profit. I'll offer the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $12,500}

This is a competitive price that should be attractive to Bob, but still allows me to earn a decent profit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is lower than I had hoped, but it's still a decent price. Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm not willing to sell it to him for $11,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Next, I'll make a new offer to Bob, trying to get closer to the true value of the product to him:

{""product_price"": $13,000}

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send the counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $13,000}

This offer is higher than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle or even accept this price."
