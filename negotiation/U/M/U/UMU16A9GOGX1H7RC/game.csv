"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $100 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. Would you be willing to go down to $95?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $98.",98.0,Alice,5,
