{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still higher than your maximum budget of $80. You'll counteroffer Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still looking to save money, and $100 is still more than your budget. You can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $100 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. Would you be willing to go down to $95?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $98. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $98 is getting closer to your budget, it's still more than you're willing to spend. You've had several rounds of negotiation and it seems Alice isn't going to budge much further.  Since John offers the product for $80, it's the best option for you to save the most money."
