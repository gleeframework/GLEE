"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
