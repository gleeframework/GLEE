"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're willing to pay up to $100, so Alice's offer is tempting, but it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $80? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $85 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
