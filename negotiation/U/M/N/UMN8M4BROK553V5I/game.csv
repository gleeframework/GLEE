"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit lower, Alice.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers?  Would you be willing to do $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500 is too high, so I'll offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
