Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your creative suggestion, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,250. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $12,500 is too high, so I'll offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000.  It's better to secure the deal with John at this point and avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations."
