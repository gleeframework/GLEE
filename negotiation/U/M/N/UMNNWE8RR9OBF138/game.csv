"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the introduction.  While the product is interesting, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and a strong return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away at anything over $1,000,000. How about we try to find a compromise around $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. Let's find a way to make this work.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer, but I value our discussions and believe we can reach an agreement. Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? This would be a final offer from my side.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency.  However, that final offer is still far above what I can justify.  If you're truly motivated to sell, I could go as high as $1,050,000, but that's absolutely my limit.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
