"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. I'm confident John will buy it for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I have some room to maneuver."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to drop the price further, but still aiming for a price that is above my minimum. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to make a reasonable offer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. It's getting closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

We are approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. I am going to lower my price once more, hoping to get a better deal than John's offer, but still above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the chance of Bob accepting a higher price is slim. John's offer is secure and guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the sure thing than risk getting stuck with a lower price or potentially no deal at all."
