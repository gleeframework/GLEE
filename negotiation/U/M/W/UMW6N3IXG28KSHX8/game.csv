"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $1,120,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is the last offer I'll make, so I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
