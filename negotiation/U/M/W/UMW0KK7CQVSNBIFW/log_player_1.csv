Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $10,000 (I'd rather sell to John than lose this much).
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $12,000
* **Negotiation space:** $2,000 (the difference between my minimum and Bob's maximum).

By offering $11,500, I'm aiming for a good middle ground:

* **I earn a significant profit:** $1,500 more than my minimum, which is a good deal for me.
* **Bob gets a good price:** $500 less than his maximum, which is a good deal for him, and might make him more likely to accept. 

Let me know if you'd like me to adjust my offer based on how Bob reacts!"
