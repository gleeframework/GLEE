"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can get the price down significantly. How about we start at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is just too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a great deal. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000, which I think is a very fair offer.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
