"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but  $950,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'll counter with a higher price, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to you. How about we compromise at $850,000?

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I think I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  Considering your interest and the product's value, how about we settle on $825,000?
