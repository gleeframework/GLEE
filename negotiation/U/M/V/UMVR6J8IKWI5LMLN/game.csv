"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to you. How about we compromise at $850,000?  This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  Considering your interest and the product's value, how about we settle on $825,000? This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal and brings us closer to a final agreement.  Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to compromise. $780,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work for me. However, I'm willing to go down to $800,000.
