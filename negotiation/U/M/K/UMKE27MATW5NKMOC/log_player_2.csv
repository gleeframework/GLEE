"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to see you're getting closer to a price you're comfortable with. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $10,800. I'll offer you a compromise at $11,200. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close! However, I'm still not willing to go all the way to $11,000. I'll offer you a compromise at $11,100. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower than $11,100.  She's moving in small increments now. Accepting saves time and gets a price significantly better than John's offer."
