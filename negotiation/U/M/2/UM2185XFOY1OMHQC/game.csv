"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
