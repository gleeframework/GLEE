It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of 700000. Considering the product's value and your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for 725000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and $725,000 is a good deal compared to John's price. It's worth accepting this offer."
