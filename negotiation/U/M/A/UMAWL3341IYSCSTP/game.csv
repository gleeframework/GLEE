"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I know this is a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll derive from it. Let's discuss!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  How about $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $750,000 is still not a viable option for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $1,000,000.  My absolute limit is $800,000.  Take it or leave it.",800000.0,Bob,6,
