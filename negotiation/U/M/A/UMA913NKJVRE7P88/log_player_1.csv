"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 14000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to secure a good deal.  I'm aware of the 10-round limit and John's offer, but I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering $12,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below $12,000.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I still have 6 rounds left to potentially negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to sell at my minimum acceptable price.  I have 5 rounds left to potentially close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
