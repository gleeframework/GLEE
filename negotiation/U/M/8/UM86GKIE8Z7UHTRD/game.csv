"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit much.  How about we settle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering $8,500 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
