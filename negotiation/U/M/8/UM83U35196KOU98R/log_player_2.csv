"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $140. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While it's slightly above Alice's value, $140 is still less than your maximum price and cheaper than buying from John."
