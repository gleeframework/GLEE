"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point.  You have leverage because you can always buy from John. By rejecting, you start the negotiation and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm confident I can get her closer to my target price with another counteroffer.  I'm not in a rush to buy and have the option of buying from John, so I have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a decent profit for you.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product for $10,250. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $10,250 is still a bit high. I believe I can get a better price with another counteroffer, as I have the option of buying from John if negotiations fall through. It's worth seeing if I can get her down to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $10,300. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my price, but she's still not willing to go lower than $10,000. At this point, I've already spent six rounds negotiating and it's becoming clear that we may not reach an agreement. Given that I have a guaranteed alternative with John at $8,000, I'm going to take that option to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget."
