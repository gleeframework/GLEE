Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product has potential, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start at $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $700,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a little steep for me.  To be honest, I'm willing to go up to $750,000. It's a big investment, and that's really the most I can justify at this point.
