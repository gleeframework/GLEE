"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product has potential, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start at $700,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a little steep for me.  To be honest, I'm willing to go up to $750,000. It's a big investment, and that's really the most I can justify at this point.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is the best deal I can offer, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
