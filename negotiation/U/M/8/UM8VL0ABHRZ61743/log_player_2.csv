"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $120. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to purchase it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $120 to you and John is willing to sell it for $120, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. You can get the product for the same price from John without the hassle of negotiating."
