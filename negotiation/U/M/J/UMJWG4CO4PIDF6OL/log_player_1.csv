Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low. The value of this product for you is $1,000,000, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,000,000. This product is truly unique, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. How about we meet at $1,025,000? It's a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is getting closer to my desired price, we're still quite far apart. With only four rounds remaining, I don't have time to continue this back-and-forth. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's a safe and secure deal that ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money."
