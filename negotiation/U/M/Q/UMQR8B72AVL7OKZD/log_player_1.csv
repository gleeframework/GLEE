Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth more than what I'm asking. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your $120 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $150, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting too low, demonstrating the product's worth.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to your minimum, but you can likely do better. You're aiming for as much profit as possible.  By rejecting, you can counteroffer with a slightly higher price, potentially securing a better deal than $130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $130 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $135? It's a fair price for a great product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise:

* **Not too aggressive:** It's a small increase from Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Still profitable:** You're getting closer to your desired price range.
* **Focus on value:** You remind Bob of the product's worth to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While a little lower than your ideal price, accepting Bob's offer at $132 is a good decision. Here's why:

* **Profit is secured:** You're earning more than your minimum ($120) and close to your initial target. 
* **Negotiation is tiring:**  Further negotiation might lead to more back and forth, potentially leading to a lower price or a stalled deal.
* **Time is money:**  You're securing a sale, and further haggling could waste time you could spend with other buyers or opportunities.

This choice balances the desire for higher profit with the need for a timely and successful transaction."
