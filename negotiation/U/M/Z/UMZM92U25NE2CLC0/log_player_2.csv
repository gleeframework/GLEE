Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value while still providing you with a great deal.
