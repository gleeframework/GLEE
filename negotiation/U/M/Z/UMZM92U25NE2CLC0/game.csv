"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making an offer of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value while still providing you with a great deal. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,350,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $1,320,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,320,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,330,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  ",1330000.0,Alice,5,
