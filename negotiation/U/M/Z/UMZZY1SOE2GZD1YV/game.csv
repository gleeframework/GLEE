"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,500. This is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find common ground.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for the product. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",13500.0,Bob,6,
