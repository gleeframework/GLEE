"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's too early to buy from John as there's room for negotiation with Alice. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating that Bob is serious about negotiating. $12,000 is still within Bob's budget, but leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. There's still room for negotiation, and it's too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still within his budget but allows room for further negotiation.  By offering a ""fair"" price, Bob is attempting to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and potentially reach an agreement quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,500. This is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, $14,500 is still above his budget.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to push for a price closer to his $10,000 limit. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further. However, it's also getting close to the point where buying from John might be the more reasonable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for the product. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, showing Bob's willingness to compromise while still maintaining his budget constraints.  $13,500 is within Bob's budget, but leaves a small margin for further negotiation if Alice is still unwilling to come down. This could be the turning point, and if Alice rejects, buying from John becomes a more realistic option."
