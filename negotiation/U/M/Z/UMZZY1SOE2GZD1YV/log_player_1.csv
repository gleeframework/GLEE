"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value, but also factoring in that Bob has a perceived value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and engaging:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential benefit for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I've set a high initial price, knowing that Bob will likely counteroffer. This is a standard negotiation tactic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can secure a better price with further negotiation.  
* **Staying in the game:** I have 8 rounds left and selling to John would be a guaranteed $15,000.  However, I have a chance to get a higher price from Bob if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and counter-offer:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $18,000, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasize the value:**  I reiterate that $16,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the value he places on the product. This keeps the focus on the potential benefit to him.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:** I'm using language that encourages continued negotiation and finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, I'm still not comfortable settling for it. 
* **Possible higher offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to $15,000.
* **Time to play it safe:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $15,000, but I'm feeling optimistic about getting a better deal with Bob. However, with only 6 rounds left, I need to be strategic.  If Bob's next offer isn't closer to my price, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,500. This is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's in the middle of Bob's offer and my last offer. This signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on the final deal:** I emphasize that $14,500 is a fair price for both of us and suggest that we close the deal. This encourages Bob to accept the offer.
* **Positive and persuasive:** I use language that's optimistic and suggests that finding common ground is possible. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept. 

**Important Note:** With only 5 rounds left, I'm taking a more aggressive approach by making a substantial compromise. This will hopefully incentivize Bob to accept the offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I might have to reconsider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500 for the product. This is a good compromise that reflects the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's find a way to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds left, the negotiation isn't progressing fast enough to get a price I'm happy with.
* **Too much risk:**  Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Further negotiation might lead to a better deal, but it also carries the risk of ending up with a lower price or running out of time. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is a safe and profitable option considering the limited time and the risk of further negotiation. 

While I'm hoping to get a higher price, it's important to be realistic and secure a profit. John's offer is a reliable and guaranteed way to make a decent return on the product."
