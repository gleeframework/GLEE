"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This offer reflects a compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,275,000. This offer is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both understand this product holds.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $1,225,000 is still below my minimum, but I want to close this deal. Let's split the difference. I'm offering a final price of $1,250,000. This is my last offer. If you reject it, I will have to explore other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,230,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope you can understand my position and meet me halfway.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
