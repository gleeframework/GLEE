Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision soon as I have another interested party."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can aim high with Bob. Starting at $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another interested party (even if John isn't strictly waiting in the wings) adds a time pressure element that might encourage Bob to accept quickly.
* **Justification of Value:** While you don't want to reveal all your cards, implying the product's value by calling it an ""exclusive opportunity"" could make the higher price more palatable. 

This strategy aims to secure a significant profit margin with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on your guaranteed sale to John."
