{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $95. I think you'll find it valuable, and this is a great deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you could offer the product at $100 and get your guaranteed value from John, there's a chance Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $95 is still a profit for you and a significant discount for Bob compared to him not buying it at all. This makes it more likely he'll accept. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By mentioning you have another buyer, you create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This offer balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring you don't lose out on a sale."
