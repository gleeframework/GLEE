Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,150,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as that's the highest I can go right now. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise considering I'm already exceeding my initial budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly stuck at $950,000 and is showing signs of potentially walking away. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our desired profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away and leaving us with nothing."
