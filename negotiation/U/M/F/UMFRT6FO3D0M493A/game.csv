"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you this fantastic product first.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,150,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, as that's the highest I can go right now. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true market value.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise considering I'm already exceeding my initial budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a good deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I may have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
