"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a strong offer that leans towards your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the price in Bob's mind.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, starting at Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,200,000) is likely to be immediately rejected.  $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation and signals a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Gauge Bob's Response:**  This first offer is as much about gathering information as it is about making a sale. Bob's response will give us insight into his negotiation style and how aggressively we can proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant profit, we're still early in the negotiation. Bob's offer indicates he's willing to pay a substantial amount, suggesting there's room to push for a higher price.  We'll counter in the next round to try and close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Could you consider $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($950,000) and our previous ask ($1,100,000). This signals a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a strong price.
* **Maintaining Value:** We don't want to drop our price too drastically too quickly, or we risk devaluing the product in Bob's eyes.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This counteroffer leaves some room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my spending within my limit. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong profit margin and is a significant amount over our minimum acceptable price. While we could potentially push for a little more in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a great deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
