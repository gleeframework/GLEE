# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can do better than $1,100,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above the price I'd ideally like to pay. There's still room for negotiation. I'll try to get the price down further."
