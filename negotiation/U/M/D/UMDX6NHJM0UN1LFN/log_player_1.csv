"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm confident it can significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing it's above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Optimistic Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a ""high-ball"" strategy, hoping to leverage Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum.  I'll carefully assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, my budget allows for a maximum investment of $950,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is higher than his perceived value of $800,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown flexibility in his initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a safe deal. However, there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions. I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum while still being within a range that Bob might find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer,  I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the significant value and potential benefits the product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value and potential benefits of the product to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially find common ground.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being within a reasonable range for Bob.  My goal is to create a sense of urgency while demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in Round 4, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal with Bob altogether.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential risk of a lower offer from Bob in subsequent rounds or the need to sell to John at a slightly lower price.

**Strategy:**

In this scenario, the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal. Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option, ensuring a quick and profitable sale."
