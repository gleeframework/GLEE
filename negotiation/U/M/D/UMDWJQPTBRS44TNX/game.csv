"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  Considering the true value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I think this price still reflects the product's value, but it's a bit more reasonable for me. What do you think?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
