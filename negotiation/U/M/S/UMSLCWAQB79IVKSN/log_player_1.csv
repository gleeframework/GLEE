Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above my minimum acceptable value but below Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't accept $900,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but it allows us to both get a good deal. Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,025,000 is a fair compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable value and significantly closer to Bob's initial offer, suggesting a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
