"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $95? It's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get the deal done.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $108. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet at $107? It's still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",107.0,Alice,5,
