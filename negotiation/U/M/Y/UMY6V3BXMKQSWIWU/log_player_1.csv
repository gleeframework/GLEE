Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $110 allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a price range above your minimum ($80) and John's offer. 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  If you start too high (e.g., $119), Bob might be immediately turned off and not bother with a counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring a sale and exceeding your minimum acceptable price."
