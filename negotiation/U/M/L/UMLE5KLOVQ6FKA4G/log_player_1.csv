Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum:**  I won't sell for less than $8,000 because that's what John is willing to pay.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so anything less than that would be a good deal for him. 
* **Negotiation space:** By offering $10,000, I leave some room for negotiation. Bob might try to lower the price, but I'm confident he'll see the value in the product and be willing to pay at least $10,000.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while ensuring I get a better price than selling to John."
