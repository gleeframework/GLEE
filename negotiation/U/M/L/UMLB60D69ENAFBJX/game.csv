"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,500,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
