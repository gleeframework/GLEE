Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I still believe $100 would be a fair price for this product. I am not willing to compromise on this amount. Would you be able to meet me at $100?

Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome than selling to John for $100."
