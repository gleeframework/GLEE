Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to haggle. 
* **Attractive but Realistic:**  While $11,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000), it's still a enticing offer compared to your guaranteed price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while considering Bob's potential rejection."
