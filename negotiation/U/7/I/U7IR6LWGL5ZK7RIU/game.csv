"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I go down to $155?  That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $150. I'm really keen to get this product, but that's my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
