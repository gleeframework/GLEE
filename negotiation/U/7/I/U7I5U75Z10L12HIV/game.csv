"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,500? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we could finalize the deal quickly.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm really interested in buying the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $8,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile, but I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $9,000? This is a good compromise, and we can close the deal quickly.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we may not be able to come to an agreement.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $8,700? This is my absolute bottom line, and if we can't agree on this, I'll need to move on to other buyers. ",8700.0,Alice,7,
