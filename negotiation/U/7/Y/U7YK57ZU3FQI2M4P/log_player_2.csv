"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and $1,300,000 is far from his ideal price.  There is room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,150,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob wants to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and push the price down further.  Bob is still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice than buying from John at $1,500,000."
