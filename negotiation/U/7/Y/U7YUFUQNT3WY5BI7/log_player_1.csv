{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $950,000, I allow for a comfortable margin for Bob to counter without me having to drop below my minimum.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof). I'll also consider the time spent in negotiation, as I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly below my ideal price and what the product is worth to him.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested in the product and has shown a willingness to pay a substantial price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price by counteroffering. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. I want to show flexibility but also demonstrate the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and still leaves a fair margin for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique value to emphasize why my price is still justified.
* **Fair Margin:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair margin"" for both of us to encourage a sense of mutual benefit.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing negotiations or accepting John's offer.  I might also consider reducing my counteroffer slightly, but I'll be careful not to drop below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob's offer is the same as his previous counteroffer. This suggests he may be unwilling to go higher.
* **Close to Minimum:** While $850,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept, as I'd be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  There's still a possibility of getting closer to my desired price by counteroffering again. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price than my previous one, but still above my minimum. I'll also emphasize the value and unique features of the product, hoping to persuade Bob to reconsider his stance. However, I will closely monitor the situation and be prepared to accept John's offer if negotiations stall further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm eager to reach a deal.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000, recognizing the value of a final agreement. This is a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm lowering the price to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, but also that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Emphasize Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the value of reaching an agreement to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Fair Price:** I'm reiterating the ""fair price"" for both of us to create a sense of mutual benefit and encourage a positive response.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale. However, if there's any indication that Bob might be willing to negotiate further, I'll explore further options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $875,000, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $862,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $862,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Exhaustion:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but has reached a price that's likely his limit. Further negotiation might be unproductive and time-consuming.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might lead to further negotiation, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with John's offer of $800,000.

**Next Steps:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice, as it allows me to secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable price without risking further negotiation or losing the deal altogether."
