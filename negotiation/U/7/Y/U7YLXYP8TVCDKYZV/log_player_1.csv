Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay a premium.  Starting high gives you room to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""demand,"" you create a perceived sense of scarcity and desirability, making the higher price more palatable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob's perspective, leaving room for him to counter-offer if he's interested. 

**Important:** While you have a backup buyer, pushing Bob too hard could make him walk away. This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing your profit and securing a deal."
