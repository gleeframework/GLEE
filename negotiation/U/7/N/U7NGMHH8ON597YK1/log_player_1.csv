Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,490,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's negotiable, it positions the product as highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning a ""unique value proposition"" subtly implies there are reasons for the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit by testing Bob's willingness to pay a premium. 
* There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, you have the security of John's guaranteed purchase. 
* Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some room to go down while still making a significant profit."
