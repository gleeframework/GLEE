"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 500000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $500,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is still a significant discount from the value I place on the product, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, but $1,200,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $650,000? I believe that would be a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering your stated value for it.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's still aiming for a much higher number than your ideal price or what John is offering.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, and there's no guarantee Alice will go that low, even with more rounds of negotiation.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
