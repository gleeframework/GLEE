Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Test the Waters:** Starting at $150 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the high starting point leaves room for negotiation. You can always lower the price, potentially settling somewhere between $100 and $150.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging the security of a guaranteed sale to John."
