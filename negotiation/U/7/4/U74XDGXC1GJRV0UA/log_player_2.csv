The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. That's way over my budget. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}

I'm offering Alice $80 for the product, which is my maximum budget. Hopefully, she'll consider it, but I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is still too high. Even though it's lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $80. It's the best deal I can get at this point."
