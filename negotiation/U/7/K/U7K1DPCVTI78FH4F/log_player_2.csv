"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a special opportunity given your interest and the value this product holds for you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have a better alternative ($10,000 from John). By countering, you aim to lower the price closer to your ideal range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer ($9,000 vs. $12,000) creates room for negotiation and potentially brings the final price closer to your target.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message maintains a polite and positive tone, acknowledging Alice's offer while clearly stating your position.
* **Justification:** Suggesting a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties frames the counteroffer as a win-win solution. 

This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot accept $9,000 for the product. I am unable to move forward with your offer. Let's aim for a middle ground. How about considering $10,500 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has met you halfway between your previous offer and her initial price. Accepting $10,500 is a good deal since it's only slightly above your ideal price from John. Further negotiation might not yield a significant difference and risks prolonging the process."
