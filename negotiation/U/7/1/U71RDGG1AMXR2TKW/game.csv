"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,750.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement in this round.",8750.0,Alice,5,
