"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a number that I think reflects its true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a discounted rate.

Bob is still saving money by going with John, but it's close.  Let's see if Bob can get Alice down a little further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is only willing to go down to $925,000, which is still more expensive than buying from John. Bob should stick with his original plan and buy from John."
