"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a discounted rate.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I'm confident you'll see it's a win-win for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
