{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a significant markup:** I'm aiming to get as much as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This increases the likelihood he'll accept, but still leaves room for me to get closer to my ideal price.
* **It's above my minimum:**  If Bob rejects, I have room to negotiate down, but I'm still above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is above my minimum, I can likely do better with a counteroffer. Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, demonstrating he's willing to negotiate.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $8,750?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000, and it's higher than what John is offering.  At this point, it's better to accept and secure the sale.  Further negotiation might not result in a better price, and I risk losing Bob entirely."
