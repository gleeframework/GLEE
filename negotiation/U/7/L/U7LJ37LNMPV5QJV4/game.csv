"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $8,750?  This would give us both a fair deal.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,250. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.",8250.0,Bob,4,
