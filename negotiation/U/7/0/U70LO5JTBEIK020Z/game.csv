"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we settle on $1,375,000?  This represents a fair compromise.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm confident that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're driving a hard bargain! While I value a good negotiation, $1,250,000 is pushing the limit of what I can accept.  Let's try this - $1,310,000 and we have a deal.  This offer stands, but I'm very close to exploring other options.",1310000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,310,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on it.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
