Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offers are decreasing significantly each round, and he's now below $1,250,000.  It's unlikely he'll come close enough to my $1,300,000+ target. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely."
