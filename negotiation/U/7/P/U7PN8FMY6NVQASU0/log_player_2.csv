"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,750,000. This is a unique product worth a significant amount to both of us.  I believe this price reflects its value and provides a fair opportunity for both parties.  Let me know if you're interested.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $1,500,000.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's true the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you can get it for that price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to save $250,000."
