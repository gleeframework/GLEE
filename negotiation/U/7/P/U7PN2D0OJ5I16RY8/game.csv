"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close the deal at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,125,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,120,000.
