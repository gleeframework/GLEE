"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $7500 for it. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! I understand your offer, but I'm going to need a bit more than $7500 to let it go. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's a great price for a fantastic product like this, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $7500. Would you be willing to meet me at $7800? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy it from you if we can agree on that price.",7800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate.  While $7800 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $8200 to make this happen. It's a fair price for the quality of this product, and it shows my commitment to finding a solution. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7900? I think that's the best I can do, and I'm willing to make a commitment to buy the product if we can agree on that price.",7900.0,Bob,6,
