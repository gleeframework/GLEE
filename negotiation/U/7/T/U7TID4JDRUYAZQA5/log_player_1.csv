"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll experience."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and ""significant return on investment,"" I'm aiming to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" signals that I'm open to negotiation and willing to move from this starting price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving room to work towards a mutually agreeable deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more significant discount. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and reach a price closer to $2,000,000.  I'm not ready to accept his offer or sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. I'm willing to adjust my price to $2,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the unique nature of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer ($2,250,000) to show Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate. 
* **Anchoring:** I'm still aiming high ($2,100,000) to keep the price closer to my target and above Bob's initial offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the ""unique nature"" and value of the product to justify the higher price and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but I'm still looking to make a more substantial discount. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking stubbornly to increments of $100,000, but he's still significantly below my minimum. While the negotiation is progressing slowly, I believe there's more room to maneuver.  I'm willing to counter again in Round 5, aiming for around $1,900,000. I'm not ready to accept his offer or sell to John at a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To that end, I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,950,000. This is a significant move towards your price point, reflecting my desire to close this deal.  Let me know if this works for you."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Move:** I'm making a larger jump in price reduction this round ($150,000) to signal my willingness to work with Bob and find a compromise. 
* **Middle Ground:** The price of $1,950,000 represents a more substantial move towards the middle ground between my initial offer and his.
* **Call to Action:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage a response and potentially break the back-and-forth pattern. 

I believe this counteroffer balances my goal of securing a strong price while demonstrating flexibility to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a significant amount. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to make sure we're getting close to a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not showing a willingness to meet me even near my minimum acceptable price. He's returned to his pattern of incremental offers and is now below my safety net of John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better outcome than $1,500,000. Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to cut my losses and sell the product to John, securing my minimum acceptable profit."
