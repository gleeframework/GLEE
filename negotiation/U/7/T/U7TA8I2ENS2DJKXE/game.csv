"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good price for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,500?  That's closer to what I can afford, and it's a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,4,
