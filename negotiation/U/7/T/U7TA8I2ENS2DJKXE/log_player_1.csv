"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $11,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as I think I can still get a better deal from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a good price for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,500?  That's closer to what I can afford, and it's a good price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,500 is a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by pushing for a higher price.  I'm happy with this outcome."
