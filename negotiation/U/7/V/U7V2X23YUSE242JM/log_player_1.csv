Unfortunately, Bob's final offer is still lower than what I'm comfortable with. Since I'm getting close to the end of the negotiation and don't want to risk getting a worse deal, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still better than nothing and will allow me to move on to other opportunities."
