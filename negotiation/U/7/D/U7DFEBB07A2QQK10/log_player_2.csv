"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than what you're willing to pay from John ($15,000).  While you could get it for $10,000 from another seller, that information is not available in this scenario. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
