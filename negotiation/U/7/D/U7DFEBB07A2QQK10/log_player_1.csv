{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great price for Alice.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering it at his maximum valuation ($15,000) might seem too aggressive and could lead to an immediate rejection. 

By setting the initial price at $14,000, Alice increases the chances of a successful sale to Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above her minimum."
