"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I would get from the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your business, $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, reflecting a compromise on both our ends. This price still allows you a substantial gain, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,150,000. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I would get from the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to make a deal.",1080000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your continued interest.  While I value your business, $1,080,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. I'm offering a price of $1,120,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the significant value this product provides to you. Let's finalize this deal and avoid further negotiation.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one final concession. However, $1,120,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.
