Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs. Considering its market worth and the benefits it offers, we propose a purchase price of $12,000. This offer allows you to secure a product that is valued at $10,000 by you, while also providing you with a favorable return on investment. We look forward to your positive consideration of this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than the product's worth to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay and more importantly, more than John's offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at your target price of $10,000."
