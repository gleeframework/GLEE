``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, there's potential to negotiate further and get an even better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if he can secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $9,500 is closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,250.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250.
