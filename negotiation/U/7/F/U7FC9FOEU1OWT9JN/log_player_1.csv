Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that the price is right. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm getting. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is moving towards our desired price point.  We're still early in the negotiation and have room to continue pushing for a higher amount."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,100,000 for the product. I think this is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to our minimum, his language suggests there's still some wiggle room.  He's stated this is his ""maximum,"" but in negotiations, such absolutes are rarely set in stone. We still have rounds to spare and can apply a bit more pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. You're clearly serious about this, and so am I.  Let's close this deal today. How about $1,300,000?  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's time to apply some pressure and signal that we're reaching the end of our negotiating window.  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency.  The price is still significantly above John's offer, but low enough that Bob might be tempted to avoid further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a deal. I'll offer $1,200,000 for the product, and I hope you can meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is very close to our desired price, and we've signaled our firm stance.  While we *might* be able to squeeze a bit more in the remaining rounds, there's also the risk that he walks away. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above our fallback option (John)."
