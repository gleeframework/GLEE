This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $80,000 less than John's price and $280,000 less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Value:**  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. Continuing might yield smaller gains, while potentially dragging on and increasing the risk of Alice walking away.
* **Alice's Tone:**  Alice's message suggests this is her final offer.  Pushing further might lead to an impasse. 

Taking the deal now secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
