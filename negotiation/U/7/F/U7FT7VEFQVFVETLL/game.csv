"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you consider $900,000? That would allow me to make a worthwhile investment while staying within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the conversation. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be fair to myself. I can offer it to you for $920,000.
