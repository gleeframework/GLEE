Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate further?

Explanation: Bob is holding firm at his valuation of $8,000. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for the same amount, it makes the most sense to sell to John now and avoid further negotiation."
