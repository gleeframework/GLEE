"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You're getting the product for $1,100,000 from Alice, compared to $1,200,000 from John. 
* **You're still getting a good deal.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for less.  Even though you're saving less than you might hope, it's still a worthwhile purchase."
