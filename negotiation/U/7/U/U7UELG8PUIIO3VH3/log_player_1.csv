Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that Bob values the product at $15,000, giving him some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to the value you place on the product. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's close enough to my target price and significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000. It's a good deal, considering Bob's willingness to compromise and the fact that he values the product at $15,000.  I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
