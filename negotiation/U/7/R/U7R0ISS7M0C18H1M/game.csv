"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let's get this deal done!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your confidence in the product, but $1,000,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 just doesn't cover the value I've invested in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still above my budget.  How about we meet at $875,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures a quick and easy transaction.  Let's work together to find common ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding common ground. However, $875,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a price that allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to meet at $880,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it would ensure a smooth transaction. What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a good price.  To be honest, $880,000 just isn't enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $895,000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects a considerable compromise on my part.  Let's make this happen.",895000.0,Alice,7,
