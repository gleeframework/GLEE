Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
