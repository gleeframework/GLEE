"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, it's still above his ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $108. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $108 is less than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** While Bob could continue negotiating, the difference between $108 and his ideal price is small.  It's possible further negotiations won't result in a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob risks losing the deal to another buyer if he continues to reject offers.

Considering these factors, accepting the offer at $108 is the most sensible choice. It allows Bob to acquire the product within his budget and avoid the risk of losing out completely."
