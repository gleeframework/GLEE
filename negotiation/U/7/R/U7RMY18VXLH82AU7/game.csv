"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $9,000. I'd like to propose $8,750. It's a compromise that I think is fair, and it's still a great price for the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still being a good deal for me.  Let's close this deal and get you the product you want.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to propose $8,750 again, as I mentioned earlier. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,6,
