Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob. It's worth the risk to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $850,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair return on my investment. Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $900,000 is a good deal and gets me closer to my desired value.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale altogether, and I don't want to settle for the $800,000 offer from John."
