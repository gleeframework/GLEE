"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate and feels less aggressive than starting at my minimum.
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer allows for a few rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and tries to establish a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe we can both walk away happy. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've lowered my price significantly from the previous round, showing I'm serious about making a deal with Bob.
* **Maintaining my value:**  $16,000 is still a good price for me, and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and encouraging, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $15,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a better one. I could end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time is ticking:**  We're already in Round 4, and I have limited rounds to negotiate. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this offer is reasonable and secures a good profit."
