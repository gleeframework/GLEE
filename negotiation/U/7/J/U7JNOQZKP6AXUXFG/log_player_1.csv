"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Let's start closer to my value of $800,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This leaves room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm sure we can find a middle ground. How about $950,000? That's a fair price considering your stated value and gives us both room to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our values and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can get more, especially since I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if this negotiation fails."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. Let's be realistic - we both know this product is worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about making a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, which I appreciate.  $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  To make a deal happen, I'm willing to go up to $910,000. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to finalizing this agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $910,000 is still not quite there for me.  We're so close to a deal! How about we split the difference?
