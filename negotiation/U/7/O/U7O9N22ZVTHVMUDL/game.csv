"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and it's a significant discount from your initial offer. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, I'm still aiming for a figure closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? This feels like a reasonable compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'd like to propose $1,700,000. This is a fair price for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is still a significant step away from what I had in mind.  How about we try $1,900,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still not willing to go up to $1,900,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,850,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle from here.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
