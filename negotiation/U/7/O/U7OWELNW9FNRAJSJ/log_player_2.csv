Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
