{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well within your budget. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than the price John is willing to pay, giving Bob an incentive to negotiate with you instead of losing the opportunity entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $950,000? I think this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired value.  Rejecting allows me to counter with a higher price, potentially reaching a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet you at $1,025,000. I propose we aim for $1,000,000, which is closer to my maximum acceptable price. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, this is still a good deal considering my alternative is selling to John for $1,200,000.  Accepting ensures a sale and a decent profit."
