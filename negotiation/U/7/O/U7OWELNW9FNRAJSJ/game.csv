"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort, but I'm hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $950,000? I think this would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet you at $1,025,000. I propose we aim for $1,000,000, which is closer to my maximum acceptable price. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
