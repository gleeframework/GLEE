"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while still being a great deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a fair deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while ensuring I get a great deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,020,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
