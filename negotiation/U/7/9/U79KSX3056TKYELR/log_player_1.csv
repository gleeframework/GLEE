Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm willing to let it go for $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$140** is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* I'm keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $150, so I'm not willing to drop the price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $120, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about $135? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$135** is a compromise: it's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* The message is still friendly and encourages continued negotiation.
* I'm keeping the option to sell to John for $150 in mind, but I'm willing to compromise a little to close the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is still below my ideal price point, it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since Bob is being firm at $130 and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, I'll accept his offer.  It's a good outcome considering Bob's initial offer was $125.  Selling to John would be better, but I'm not willing to risk losing the sale entirely."
