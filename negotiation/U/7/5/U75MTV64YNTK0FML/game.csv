"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product. This is my absolute top price, as I've found another seller willing to offer it to me for this price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, as I still need to make a profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
