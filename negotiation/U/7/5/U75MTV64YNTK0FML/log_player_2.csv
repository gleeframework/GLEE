"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $18,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way above his budget, and he knows he can get the product for less."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, as I still need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 
While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He knows he can get the product from John for $12,000, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
