"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $100 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110? That's a fair price closer to the middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $110 is still quite low for me.  Would you be willing to meet at $140? That's a significant compromise on my end.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  Could you do $120?  I can't go any higher.",120.0,Bob,6,
