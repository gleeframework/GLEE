Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be worth it.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  However, $9,750 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:

Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000. Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000 right now, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice. You maximize your savings by taking the guaranteed deal from John."
