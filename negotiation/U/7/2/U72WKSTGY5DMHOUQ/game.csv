"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be worth it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  However, $9,750 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,250.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,
