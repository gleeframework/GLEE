"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product for you, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, but Alice is offering it for $100. 
* This means there's room for negotiation.  
* Bob should try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $90 counteroffer. 
* While Alice is willing to negotiate, $105 is still above Bob's ideal price.
* Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you being flexible, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.50}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below $110. That's the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is getting closer to Bob's maximum of $120, but it's still too high. 
* Further negotiation is unlikely to get Alice much lower, considering she's already lowered her price from $105.
* It's more efficient for Bob to just buy from John for $120 and avoid potentially more rounds of negotiation.  He can get the product and save the time."
