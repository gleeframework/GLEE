"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a very fair offer, considering the quality and benefits you'll receive.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my needs and its value to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a substantial difference from my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while hopefully working within your budget.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I am too!  While $11,750 is closer, I'm still just outside my budget. My final offer is $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while respecting your needs. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",10500.0,Bob,6,
