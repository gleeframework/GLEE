"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a very fair offer, considering the quality and benefits you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $13,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my needs and its value to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a substantial difference from my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while hopefully working within your budget."", ""product_price"": 11750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I am too!  While $11,750 is closer, I'm still just outside my budget. My final offer is $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me while respecting your needs. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. He's presented his ""final offer,"" which signals limited room for further negotiation. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
