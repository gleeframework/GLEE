Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 is just below your minimum and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you the best chance of maximizing your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting a bit higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $19."
