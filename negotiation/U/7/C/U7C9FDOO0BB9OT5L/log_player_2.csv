"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate towards a more reasonable price.  Buying from John right now would mean missing out on a potentially better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, which is a common negotiation tactic. It leaves room for negotiation and gauges Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message remains polite and expresses interest, fostering a positive negotiation environment. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** While $65 is a low offer, it's essential to aim lower than our target price ($80) to allow for counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, how about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $90 is closer to our target, it's still above the $80 we can get from John. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice lowered her price significantly from $110, indicating she's willing to negotiate. There's room to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Time Constraint:** We have seven rounds remaining, so there's time for further negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $90 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** This offer aims for a compromise between Alice's last offer ($90) and our previous offer ($65).
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""budget"" adds a touch of realism to the negotiation and reinforces our position. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 is still below our maximum price, giving us bargaining power if Alice counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $75 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** $85 is only slightly above our fallback price with John. It's worth pushing a little further to see if we can secure a better deal.
* **Negotiating Power:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell and has moved closer to our range.  We still have some leverage.
* **Time Remaining:** With five rounds left, we have the opportunity for at least one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting close! I could maybe do $80, but that's really pushing it for me. It's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're now at our absolute maximum price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" we subtly imply that Alice could get a similar price elsewhere, nudging her to accept.
* **Slight Urgency:** While we don't want to rush Alice, letting her know this is our final offer adds a bit of pressure without being aggressive. 

**Important Note:** If Alice rejects this offer, we should seriously consider buying from John in the next round. We've reached our limit, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome."
