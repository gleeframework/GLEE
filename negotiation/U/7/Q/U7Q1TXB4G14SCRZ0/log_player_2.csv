This is an excellent price for Bob.  Let's see if we can get it even lower.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

While $400,000 is a good deal, we can likely still get a better price.  Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

Alice has come up slightly, but $450,000 is still a very good price for Bob.  It's time to close the deal before she changes her mind again or Bob runs out of rounds."
