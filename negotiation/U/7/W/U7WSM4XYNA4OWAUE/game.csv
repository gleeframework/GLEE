"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a great compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. How about we meet in the middle again at $79? It's a small compromise, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've already offered $75, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you accept my offer?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on $75, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that low of a price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $78? It's a small compromise, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",78.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $78. I'm willing to meet you at $76. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",76.0,Bob,8,
