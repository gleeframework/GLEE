Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You still have room to negotiate and potentially earn closer to your desired $12,000.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Would that be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll try to negotiate with him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer the product for $9,000. This would still be a significant saving for you and closer to a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Based on my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $8,000 for this product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge from his offer of $8,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $12,000, it's not worth risking further negotiations. Selling to John for $12,000 is the most sensible option at this point."
