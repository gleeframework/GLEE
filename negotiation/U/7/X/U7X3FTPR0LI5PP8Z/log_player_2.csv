Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough spot! Alice is clearly very attached to that $13,000 figure.  Let's weigh our options:

* **Accepting:**  We'd be overpaying by $3,000 compared to John's price. 
* **Another Counter:** There's a chance Alice might go slightly lower, but it's unlikely to be a significant drop.  We risk frustrating her and losing the deal.
* **John's Offer:** We get the product at our target price, guaranteed.

At this point, the risk outweighs the potential reward.  

**{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}** 

It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with, even if it means walking away from the negotiating table."
