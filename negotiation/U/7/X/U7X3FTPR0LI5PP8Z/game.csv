"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $17,000. What are your thoughts?",17000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $17,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $12,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm starting to think that's the best we can do. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
