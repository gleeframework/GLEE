"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than my minimum.** This gives me room to negotiate.
* **It's not outrageous.**  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested, but I don't want to scare him off with a ridiculous offer. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that offer. I believe I can get closer to my initial price point, and I'm still early in the negotiation process. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above Bob's proposed price. I want to show flexibility while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000. 

Here's why:

* **Getting closer to my desired price:** $16,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's previous offer and is only $2,000 below my initial price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and I'll have to settle for John's offer of $12,000.
* **Time constraint:** With 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer seems like the safest and most profitable option at this point."
