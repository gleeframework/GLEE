{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is still a great price for a product worth so much. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $13500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I can get him to meet my price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
