**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price well below my minimum. At this point, the risk of him not increasing his offer significantly outweighs the potential reward of squeezing a few hundred dollars more. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit and avoids further time wasted negotiating with Bob."
