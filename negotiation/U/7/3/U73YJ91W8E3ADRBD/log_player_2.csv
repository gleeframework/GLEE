"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000. Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be happy to buy it for $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This creates a negotiation space and shows Bob is serious about buying the product while trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still try to push for a lower price. There's still a gap between what Alice is willing to accept and what Bob wants to pay. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows Bob is willing to negotiate but is still trying to get a good deal. This also avoids offering a price that is too low and risks Alice walking away from the negotiation."
