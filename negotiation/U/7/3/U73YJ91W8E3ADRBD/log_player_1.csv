"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be happy to buy it for $10500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I have 9 rounds left and can potentially get a better price.  I'm willing to risk a few rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10750. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $10,750 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  With 6 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high.  It's more likely that Bob will continue to offer lower prices, and I could potentially end up selling to John for a lower price.  This offer is a good compromise and allows me to secure a reasonable profit."
