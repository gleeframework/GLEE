Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** $140 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $150, giving him incentive to accept.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while ensuring you don't lose out on the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John,  it's still below my desired profit margin. I will counteroffer to maintain a higher selling price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
