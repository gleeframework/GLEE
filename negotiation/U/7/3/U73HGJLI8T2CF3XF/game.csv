"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $17,000. I would like to propose $16,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
