# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is less than your maximum price of $1,500,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John at $1,500,000."
