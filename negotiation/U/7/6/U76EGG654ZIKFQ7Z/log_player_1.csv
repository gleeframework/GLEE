Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,250 and $7,500, which would be $7,875. Would you be open to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,875

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $8,000, $7,875 is a good compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
