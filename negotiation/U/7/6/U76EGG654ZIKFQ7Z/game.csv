"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $8,250?  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,250 and $7,500, which would be $7,875. Would you be open to that price?",7875.0,Bob,4,
