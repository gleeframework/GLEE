{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer:

* **Starts high:**  $950,000 is close to my ideal price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlights value to Bob:**  By mentioning the product's value to him, I'm trying to incentivize him to accept.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can counter with a lower price, while still aiming for a good profit.

This strategy is based on the idea of starting with a high price and gradually lowering it if necessary, but not going below my minimum value.  This should help me maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm aiming for a higher profit and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Show Bob that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Counteroffer:**  Present a price that's closer to my target, potentially closer to $900,000.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:**  See if he's truly interested in the product or just trying to get a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $900,000 is a compromise that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **Highlighting value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to remind him of the potential benefit.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message emphasizes the goal of finding a mutually agreeable solution, keeping the door open for further discussion.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain a good profit margin:** $900,000 is still above my minimum price.
* **Show flexibility:**  I've shown willingness to adjust the price, but I'm not desperate.
* **Encourage Bob to come closer to my target:**  This counteroffer puts pressure on Bob to increase his offer or risk losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $900,000. How about $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm still aiming for a higher price and believe there's room for further negotiation.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  $875,000 is still a bit below my target.  However, I'm willing to go down to $890,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's aim to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}

**Explanation:**

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm aiming for a higher profit and I don't want to keep negotiating indefinitely. 

At this point,  I've already made several compromises. Bob is being stubborn and I feel like he's not willing to pay a fair price.  

Therefore, I'm better off selling to John for $800,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to an even lower price."
