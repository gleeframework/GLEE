"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider $1,150,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'm getting from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
