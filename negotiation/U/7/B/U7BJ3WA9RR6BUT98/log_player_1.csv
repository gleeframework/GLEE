Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,190,000. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and this is a very competitive offer considering its true worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High but Negotiable:**  Starting at $1,190,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's worth is higher than Bob's estimation, potentially encouraging him to accept the high price. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a much higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
