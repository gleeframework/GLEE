Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a good deal, it's significantly lower than my starting price and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the product's value, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I get my minimum desired price.  It's a guaranteed sale and I'm happy with the outcome."
