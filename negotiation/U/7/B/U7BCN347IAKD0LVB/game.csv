"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a slightly better price. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $875,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $850,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $862,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $875,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'll meet you at $870,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",870000.0,Alice,5,
