"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is far below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,225,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for you and the fact that I have another buyer ready to pay $1,200,000.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering the other buyer you mentioned. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
