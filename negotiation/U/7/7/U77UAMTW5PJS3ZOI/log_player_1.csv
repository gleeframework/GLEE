Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer, it's way too low. I'm aiming for a higher price and have John as a backup if negotiations fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is far below what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,225,000.

Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm running out of time.  I've already made several concessions, and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiations."
