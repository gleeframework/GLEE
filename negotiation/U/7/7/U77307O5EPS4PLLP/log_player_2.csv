"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $140 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you're looking to get a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130? That's still a good price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob is willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $130.
* **Potential Savings:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $20 compared to buying from John.

While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is present.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids that risk."
