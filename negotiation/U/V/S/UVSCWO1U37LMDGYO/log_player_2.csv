"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000  to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer. It's better to counteroffer or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $19,000 is still significantly more than my budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget of $8,000. While we're getting closer, I'm not sure I can convince her to go lower. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy it from John for $8,000."
