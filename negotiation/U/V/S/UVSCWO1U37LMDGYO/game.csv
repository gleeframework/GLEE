,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product but I can only go up to $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider coming down to $19,000. This is my final offer.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $19,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm willing to go to $11,000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Bob,4,
