"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about if we set the product price at $8,800?",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I see you're trying to get closer to my price, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $9,200? It's a fair price for both of us and it would allow us to close this deal.",9200.0,Alice,5,
