"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's currently valued at $1,500,000 for me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount and allows you to acquire this valuable asset at a price that's still well below its true worth. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
