Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While the product looks great, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  Would that work for you?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $90, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and time invested in this product. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much further on the price. She's already rejected two offers and is now incrementally increasing the price. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal. John offers a guaranteed price that's within your budget."
