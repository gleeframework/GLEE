"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While the product looks great, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $90, and that's as low as I can go.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about my costs and time invested in this product. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go.",92.0,Alice,5,
