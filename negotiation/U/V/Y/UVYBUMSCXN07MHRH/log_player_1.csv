"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests anchoring high. This initial offer sets a high point for the negotiation, giving room to negotiate downwards while still potentially landing above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence in the product's value might make Bob more willing to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While starting high, I want to appear open to discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he values the product and might be willing to go slightly higher than his initial counteroffer. I'm willing to risk a few rounds to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but my initial pricing reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere in the middle.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the still-high price and potentially nudge Bob to stretch his budget. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps me significantly above both Bob's initial offer and John's standing offer, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price and a full $100,000 higher than John's standing offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away. It's unlikely I'll be able to get much higher than this in a reasonable timeframe.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now gives me access to the funds quicker, which has its own value. 
 
It's a good offer and time to accept!"
