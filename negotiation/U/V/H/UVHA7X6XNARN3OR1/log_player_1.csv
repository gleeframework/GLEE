Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice gets significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer if Bob declines."
