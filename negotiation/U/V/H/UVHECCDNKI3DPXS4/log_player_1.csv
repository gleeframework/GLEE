Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies that the price is justified, not just an arbitrary number. 
* **Urgency:** By mentioning listing it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

While there's a chance Bob will reject the initial offer, Alice has a strong fallback option with John at $15,000. This strategy maximizes her potential profit while minimizing risk."
