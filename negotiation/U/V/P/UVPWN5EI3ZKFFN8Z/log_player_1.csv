Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it brings to the table."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,400,000, there's space to negotiate down towards $1,200,000 (your minimum) if necessary, while still aiming for a price that's very favorable to you.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to subtly reinforce its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is good, it's still a significant distance from my initial ask. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price and am willing to engage in further discussion to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I could be flexible if we can get closer to $1,375,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Demonstrates Flexibility:** By countering, we show Bob that we're willing to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Strategic Price Point:** The new price of $1,375,000 keeps us significantly above our minimum ($1,200,000) while still moving towards a potential agreement with Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""Would that work for you?"" encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and my budgetary constraints. I would like to counter your offer with $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a strong price.  Here's why it makes sense to accept:

* **Significant Profit:** This offer is well above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), securing a healthy profit.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk that Bob could walk away if I push too hard. It's better to secure a very good deal than to risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means I get the money sooner, which has its own value."
