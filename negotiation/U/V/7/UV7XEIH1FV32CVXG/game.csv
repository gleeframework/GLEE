"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is still a significant investment for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for a product of this value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. Given the product's value to you, I believe $1,200,000 is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
