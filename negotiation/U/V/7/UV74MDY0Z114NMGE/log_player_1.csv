**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been offering prices significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he is slowly increasing his offer, the pace of the negotiation suggests it's unlikely he'll reach a price I find acceptable within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees I get my minimum and avoids further time wasted negotiating with Bob."
