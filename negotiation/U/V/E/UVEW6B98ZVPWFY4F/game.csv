"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on purchasing the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me somewhat closer to my budget.  To be honest though, that's still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",925000.0,Alice,5,
