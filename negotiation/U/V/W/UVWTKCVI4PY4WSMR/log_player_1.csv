"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low and far from my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that price.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider, but I understand there's some room for negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be honest, $9,000 is the highest I'd be willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's still far from ideal. I'll try to guide him closer to my minimum, but I'm prepared to walk away.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the back and forth. I want to be fair, but $9,000 is still significantly less than what I'm willing to part with it for.  How about we compromise at $13,000 and call it a deal?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about selling, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me. I could maybe do $10,500, but that's really my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob is slowly getting there, and I need to decide if squeezing more out of him is worth potentially losing the sale.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a reasonable profit.
