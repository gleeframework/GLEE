"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider, but I understand there's some room for negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $15,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be honest, $9,000 is the highest I'd be willing to go.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the back and forth. I want to be fair, but $9,000 is still significantly less than what I'm willing to part with it for.  How about we compromise at $13,000 and call it a deal?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about selling, but $13,000 is still a stretch for me. I could maybe do $10,500, but that's really my limit.",10500.0,Bob,6,
