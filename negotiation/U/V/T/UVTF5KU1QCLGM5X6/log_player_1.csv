Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have another buyer (John) as a safety net.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation and might scare Bob off. Aim for a price that gives you a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:** The message is direct and positions the product as valuable.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $1,350,000 gives you a $150,000 profit margin while leaving Bob room to negotiate if he wants.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option) adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a negotiation strategy in mind.  You can always adjust your price slightly downward, but don't go below your minimum of $1,200,000."
