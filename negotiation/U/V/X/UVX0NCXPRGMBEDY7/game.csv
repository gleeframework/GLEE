"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer. Let's find common ground here.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I can consider purchasing the product for $10,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
