"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  $12,000 allows for potential counteroffers while still being above my minimum acceptable price. 

**Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:** I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, but there's a chance I could secure a better price with Bob if I continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer. Let's find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is Strategic:** I'm bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's, showing flexibility.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate my willingness to compromise while still highlighting the product's worth.
* **Focus on Finding Common Ground:**  This language creates a collaborative tone, making Bob more likely to engage. 

**Next Steps:** I'll monitor Bob's reaction and adapt my strategy based on his counteroffer.  I'm prepared to go lower if necessary, but I'll continue to push for a price closer to $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I can consider purchasing the product for $10,000. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $10,000 is only $5,000 below my minimum acceptable price, which is a significant risk to take.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Although Bob is at his limit, there's still potential for further negotiation in future rounds. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting offers. 

**Next Steps:** I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll still be prepared to continue negotiating with him for a higher price in subsequent rounds if the opportunity arises."
