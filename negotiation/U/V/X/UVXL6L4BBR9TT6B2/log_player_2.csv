"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that's highly valuable to me. I'm confident it would be equally beneficial to you.  While I can't disclose the exact details of the product without a non-disclosure agreement, I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth to me. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
