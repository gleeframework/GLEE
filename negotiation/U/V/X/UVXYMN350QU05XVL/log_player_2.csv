Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I'd like to know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

At $1,050,000, we're getting very close to Alice's likely bottom line.  Continuing to push could backfire and she might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price."
