"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I'd like to know if this is something you'd be willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  Could you do $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000, which is as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. If you're still interested, let me know, otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
