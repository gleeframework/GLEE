"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. I believe it's worth even more, but I want to give you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can get a better price from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to buy from John for $100."
