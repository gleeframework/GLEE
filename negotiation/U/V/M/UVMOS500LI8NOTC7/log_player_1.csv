Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,400,000 is too low for me. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum price of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it."
