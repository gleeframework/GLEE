"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
