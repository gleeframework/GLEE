"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is considerably higher than your initial offer. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a compromise, so I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute minimum I can accept considering the value this product delivers.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price, but it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.
* Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price you're willing to pay.
* John offers a price well within your budget.

While you could try one more counteroffer, the risk of losing the deal with John (and potentially ending up with no product) outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price from Alice."
