We're still a ways off from my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a bit closer to $100."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $97?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $90, $88 is still a good profit above my minimum. It's better to accept now than risk him going lower or the negotiation failing completely."
