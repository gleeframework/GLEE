"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above his budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $13,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and he's already made several counteroffers. It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge much further.  John is offering a much better price, and Bob can secure the product at a price that works for him."
