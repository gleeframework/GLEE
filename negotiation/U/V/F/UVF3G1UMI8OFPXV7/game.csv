"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering I'm still paying a significant premium over what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $12,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's still significantly higher than what it's worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
