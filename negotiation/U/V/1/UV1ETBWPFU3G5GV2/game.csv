"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its actual value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I value this product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
