"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but the product's intrinsic value to me is quite high.  I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects my best effort to find a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  However,  $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm willing to accept.  My final offer is $1,000,000. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000, which is still a significant discount from your initial offer. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
