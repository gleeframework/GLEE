"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it's important to start high to leave room for negotiation.  I want to see how interested Bob really is in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  $1,200,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is still too low, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding onto a good profit.  I'm hoping this will be the final counteroffer before we close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit more. We're very close, and I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm making one final counteroffer to Bob. This is close to his last offer, and I think it's a good compromise.  If he rejects this, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm not sure Bob is going to come up any higher. I'm happy with the $1,000,000 offer from John, so I'm going to take it and avoid further negotiation."
