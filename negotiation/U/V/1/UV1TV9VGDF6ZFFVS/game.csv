"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? This still gives you a great deal and ensures a fair return for me.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this a great deal. Let's finalize this and move forward!",1000000.0,Alice,5,
