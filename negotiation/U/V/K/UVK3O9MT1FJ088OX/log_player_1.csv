Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, considering its value to me is $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway between our offers at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $14,000 is a reasonable compromise. While I could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting the $14,000 ensures a good profit over my minimum and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations.
