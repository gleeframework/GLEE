,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, considering its value to me is $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet halfway between our offers at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, which is the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",14000.0,Bob,4,
