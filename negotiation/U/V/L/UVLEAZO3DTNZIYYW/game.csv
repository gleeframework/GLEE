"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for it.  Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $75 is still a bit low for me.  However, I'm willing to go down to $85.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
