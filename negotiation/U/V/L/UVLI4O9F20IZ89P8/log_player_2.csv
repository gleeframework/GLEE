"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you, and this offer reflects a fair price point for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Rejecting Alice's offer makes sense. You can get the product for $15,000 from John, which is cheaper than Alice's $14,500 offer."
