,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  I'm very interested in the product, but I need to make sure the price is right.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8500 is a good offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference at $9250? I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9250 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm very eager to purchase the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
