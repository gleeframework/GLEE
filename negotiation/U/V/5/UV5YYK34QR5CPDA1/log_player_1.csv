Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin than John's offer.
* **Establish Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning a public listing creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always lower the price slightly during the negotiation, but you don't want to start too low."
