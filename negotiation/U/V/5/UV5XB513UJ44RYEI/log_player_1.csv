"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High initial price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.
* **Reasoning:** I'm mentioning the product's value to me to subtly emphasize its worth.
* **Open ended question:** I'm not simply stating a price, but asking Bob for his thoughts to invite him into the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a higher price.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and shows that I'm not desperate to sell. This might make Bob more willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is closer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $100, which is halfway between my minimum value ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Reasoning:**  I emphasize the product's value to justify my price.
* **Closing statement:**  I reiterate my willingness to negotiate and leave the ball in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from that price. I'd be willing to pay $92 for the product, can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:** $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's still potential to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation dynamic and indicates that I'm not under pressure to sell at a lower price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, I can't go lower than $95. This is a fair price for the product's value.  I'm open to hearing your final offer, but I can't go lower than this."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair counteroffer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, I'm setting a firm lower limit to avoid being pushed too low.
* **Clear communication:**  I explicitly state that I'm open to Bob's final offer but I won't go lower than $95. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By being firm but open, I maintain control over the negotiation while giving Bob a chance to make a final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get it even lower. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product, can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Limited time and value:** We're in round 6, with only 4 rounds remaining. The negotiation has stalled, and Bob's offer hasn't reached my minimum value of $100. 
* **Secure alternative:**  I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who is willing to pay $100 for the product. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob risks getting stuck at a lower price or running out of time. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed $100 offer from John."
