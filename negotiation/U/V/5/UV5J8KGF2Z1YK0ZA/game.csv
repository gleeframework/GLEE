"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000, which still reflects the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you about your budget, but $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
