Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000, which still reflects the product's value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than his last offer, it's still below my minimum. I'll see if I can push him higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about your budget, but $1,100,000 still doesn't reflect the true worth of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
