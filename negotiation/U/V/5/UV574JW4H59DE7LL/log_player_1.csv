Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it gives us both a good margin to work with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the product's worth while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I need to hold out for a higher price.  $1,400,000 is still significantly below my minimum value.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,600,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it aligns closely with the product's value to me while respecting my financial limitations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what I could get from John right now.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as I'm unlikely to get a better price from him. I'm going to sell to John to secure the deal."
