"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $800,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $950,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet at this price. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other offers.",950000.0,Alice,5,
