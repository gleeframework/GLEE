"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of getting a good price while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can do better than that.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but I've lowered it slightly to acknowledge Bob's counteroffer.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is only slightly better than John's, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a genuine attempt to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher than $100.  Since that's the same price John is offering, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
