"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $97.50 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference again?  $101.25?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $100.50?",100.5,Bob,6,
