"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $120
* **Your Value:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

Since Alice's offer is lower than your maximum willingness to pay and John's price, it's beneficial to accept Alice's offer. You save $30 compared to buying from John."
