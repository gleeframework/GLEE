Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's worth trying to get more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal compared to my backup offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed to encourage discussion and potential counter-offers. This keeps the door open for a slightly higher price if Bob is hesitant.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept and avoid going to my backup buyer."
