"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15000 to us, but considering its value to you, we're willing to start negotiations at $12000. Let me know if this is within your budget and we can proceed from there.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. We appreciate your feedback and understand your perspective. To better align with your budget, we propose a counteroffer of $10500 for the product. This still reflects its high value, while making it more accessible to you. We hope this proposal works for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a fair price for both parties and would love to move forward with the purchase if we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
