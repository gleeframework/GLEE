Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the value and potentially highlighting some key features, you provide a reason for the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The tone is friendly and encourages Bob to respond, even if it's to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** While John offers a safety net, aiming higher with Bob is worthwhile. Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, you could still end up with a better deal than $12,000."
