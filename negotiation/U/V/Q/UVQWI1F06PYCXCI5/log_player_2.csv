"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that is very fair to both of us.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This gives you a significant return on your investment while still allowing me to earn a substantial profit.  Let me know your thoughts.
