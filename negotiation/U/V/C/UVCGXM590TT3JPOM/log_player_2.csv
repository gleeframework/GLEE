"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is significantly higher than your maximum price of $120.  It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's your maximum price.  It shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but also sets a clear boundary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that my initial price might have been a little high. How about we meet in the middle at $175? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum price of $120. I'm not willing to pay more than that. It's better to reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $120. It's my top price, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my maximum price of $120.  I'm showing that I'm firm in my offer, hoping that Alice will eventually come down to my price to avoid losing the sale altogether."
