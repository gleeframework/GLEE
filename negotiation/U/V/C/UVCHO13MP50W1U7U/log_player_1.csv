Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Could you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is tempting, it's below what I need to consider. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise and significantly higher than John's offer.  I'll accept his offer."
