"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable for you, for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While the price is higher than Alice's value, accepting the offer at $14,000 is still the best choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Saves Money:** Buying from Alice at $14,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to John's $15,000 price.
* **Stays Within Budget:** The offer is still under Bob's $15,000 maximum."
