""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,500,000 based on your estimations.  I've considered its worth to me, and to make this a win-win, I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?"",

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** By acknowledging that the product could be worth $1,500,000 to Bob, Alice establishes the potential value upfront.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  Offering the product for $1,200,000  creates a significant profit margin for Alice (a $400,000 gain) while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  While not explicitly stated, the fact that Alice has a backup offer from John adds an implicit sense of urgency for Bob to act."
