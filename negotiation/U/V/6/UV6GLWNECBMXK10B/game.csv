"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000, which I think is a fair and competitive offer.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a bit higher than the product is worth, and I'd like to try to meet in the middle.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. I believe this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $850000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle of that and your last offer.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay $850000, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $950000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $950000, which would be $900000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to revisit the $900000 price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $975000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $925000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to accept that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm counteroffering at $995000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs.",995000.0,Alice,9,
