"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000, but I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,650,000.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $1,650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little steep for me. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,350,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,550,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
