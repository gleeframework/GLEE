"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your company. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a better price or buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($650,000) than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate upward while still aiming for a price well below my $800,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Collaborative Tone:**  I want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. By using phrases like ""thanks for the offer"" and ""what do you think?"" I'm signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Justification:** While I didn't explicitly state a reason for my lower offer, implying a limited budget or alternative options can sometimes be helpful in negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Limit:** Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is closer to my budget, but it's still above the $800,000 I can get it for from John. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since this is still a significant profit margin for her.

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. To be honest, my budget is closer to $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Transparent:** I've decided to be transparent about my budget limit. This can sometimes speed up negotiations, as it shows I'm serious but also limited in what I can offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""I'm ready to close the deal today,"" I'm suggesting that if Alice accepts my offer, we can finalize the purchase immediately. This can be an incentive for her to accept.
* **Final Offer (for now):** While I haven't explicitly said this is my final offer, it's implied. Alice needs to decide if she'd rather make a deal now or risk losing the sale."
