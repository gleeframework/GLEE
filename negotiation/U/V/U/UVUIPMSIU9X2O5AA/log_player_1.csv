"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, while also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the product's value and believe it's worth more than $1,000,000 to Bob as well.  I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. I believe I can get a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but still aiming for a strong profit.  $1,250,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $1,100,000 is closer to my desired range, but I'm confident I can get a bit more. I'll reject his offer and counter with my own in the next round.  I'm determined to maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $1,150,000. It's a good compromise that still puts me closer to my desired profit margin.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than $1,000,000, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so low. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This time, I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,100,000.  We're getting close to a deal, and I'm confident that this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept.  I'm willing to take a small hit on my profit margin to close the deal, but I won't go lower than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm running out of time, and while $1,025,000 isn't ideal, it's still a profit.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to avoid risking selling to John for $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the next round, and I don't want to lose out on the opportunity to make a profit."
