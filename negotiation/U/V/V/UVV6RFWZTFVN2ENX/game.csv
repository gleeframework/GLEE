"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $130. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible!  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we settle on $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $125. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any lower. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",125.0,Alice,5,
