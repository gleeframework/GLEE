Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. While we could try to negotiate with Bob further, there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price. Accepting John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of drawn-out negotiations with Bob."
