"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $85,  but that's my final offer.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $85 is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $80.  You have the option to buy from John at your target price, so it makes the most financial sense to do so."
