{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate. It also highlights the value of the product to him, potentially incentivizing him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $10,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is higher than my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still leaves you a good deal at $4,000 under your estimated value.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
