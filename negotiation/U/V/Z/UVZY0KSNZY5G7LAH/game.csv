"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  It's a fair price considering what I'm willing to pay and the value you're placing on the product.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a higher offer, but $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference at $10,875.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your interest in acquiring it.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,875 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800,  which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",10800.0,Bob,6,
