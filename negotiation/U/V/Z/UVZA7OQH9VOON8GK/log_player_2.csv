"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this incredible product, Bob. I'm willing to let you have it for $12,000. This is a one-time opportunity that won't come up again, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

You can do better! While $12,000 is less than Alice's initial value, you know John is willing to sell the product for $8,000. You should reject this offer and see if Alice will come down further, or go with John's offer."
