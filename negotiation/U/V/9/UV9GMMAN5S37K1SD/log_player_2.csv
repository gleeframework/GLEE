"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just any commodity; it's a treasure that has been carefully curated and nurtured over time, reflecting its true worth of $1500000.

I understand that the value of this product may resonate differently with you compared to its intrinsic worth to me. With that in mind, I am extending an offer to purchase it from me at a price that I believe is fair and reflective of its significance. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $1200000.

This offer is exclusive to you and is valid for a limited period. Should you decide to accept, I assure you a seamless transaction process with all necessary documentation provided for your convenience and peace of mind.

Please let me know if you require any further information or clarification about the product. I am more than happy to provide additional details to help you make an informed decision.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice
