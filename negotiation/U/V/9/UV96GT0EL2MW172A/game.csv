"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the valuation.  While $1,900,000 represents the high end of its potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair balance considering its inherent worth and potential returns.  What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,700,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair price given its value and my potential profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
