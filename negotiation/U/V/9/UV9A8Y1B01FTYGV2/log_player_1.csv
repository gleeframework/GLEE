Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you're significantly above your minimum.
* **Create Urgency (Subtly):**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act, potentially making him more likely to accept a higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. If he's more easygoing, this offer could be ideal.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:** How important is it to secure the sale with Bob? If you're comfortable walking away and selling to John, you could start higher and be more assertive in your negotiation."
