"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects its value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Please consider this offer carefully.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
