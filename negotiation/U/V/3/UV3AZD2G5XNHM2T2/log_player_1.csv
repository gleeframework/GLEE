"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. Given its potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** We start with a very high initial offer ($2,300,000) to set an anchor. This is significantly above both our minimum price and Bob's perceived value. Anchoring can influence negotiations, even if the initial price is unrealistic.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses confident language (""valuable product,"" ""fair starting point"") to demonstrate the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Despite the high anchor, we signal willingness to negotiate with ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" leaving room for Bob's counteroffer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting high gives us the most room to negotiate down while still achieving a price well above our minimum.
2. **Gauge Bob's Position:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will provide valuable information about his willingness to pay and negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his initial perceived value ($800,000), it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate, and we know John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000. 

We'll reject Bob's offer in this round and present a counteroffer that moves the negotiation closer to a price point favorable for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge your offer, the product's value remains higher than what you've proposed.  I could consider parting with it for $2,100,000. This price reflects the true worth of what you're getting."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We lower our price by $200,000, showing Bob we are willing to negotiate. However, the concession is substantial enough to demonstrate that we are serious about a higher price point.
* **Value Reiteration:** We continue to emphasize the product's value (""true worth"") to counter Bob's perception and justify the high price. 
* **Midpoint Aim:** Our counteroffer aims to move the negotiation toward a midpoint between our starting point and his offer, hoping to land somewhere above our $1,500,000 minimum. 

This strategy maintains a strong position while encouraging Bob to continue negotiating toward a mutually acceptable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, accepting this offer represents a significant profit and avoids the risk of:

* **Bob Walking Away:**  There's no guarantee Bob will continue to increase his offer. He might hit his limit, and we'd be left with John's lower offer.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We only have 10 rounds, and prolonged negotiation might not lead to a significantly better outcome.

Accepting this offer secures a strong profit while ensuring a successful and timely deal."
