Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still trying to be reasonable.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than $1,100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John, and minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely."
