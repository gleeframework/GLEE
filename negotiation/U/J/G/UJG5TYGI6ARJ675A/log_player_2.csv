Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
At this point, Alice has come down to $105, which is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, and there's always a risk Alice will stop negotiating altogether.  It's best to accept the deal and secure the product at a good price."
