"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high.  There's room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $8,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,200?"",

This counter-offer attempts to establish a starting point closer to my target price while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $8,700? This is still a good price for you, given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'd consider accepting. It's worth pushing a little further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,450? "",
""product_price"": 8450
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By suggesting a middle ground, we signal to Alice that we're serious about finding a deal. 
* **Maintain a downward pressure:**  We're still pushing the price closer to our ideal range."
