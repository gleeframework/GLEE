"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you see in the product,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,
