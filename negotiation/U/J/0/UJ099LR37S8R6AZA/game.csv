"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about making a deal, and I may need to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,5,
