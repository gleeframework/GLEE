Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,500?

Round 6

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the negotiations are progressing slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach $12,000 before time runs out, and accepting anything less would be a loss. It's time to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
