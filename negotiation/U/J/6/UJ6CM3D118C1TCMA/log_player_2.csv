"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a fair price. Would you be interested in buying it for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $120 is still a significant markup from her $80 valuation, and you have some room to haggle before reaching John's $150 price."
