Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than her product valuation. There's a lot of room for negotiation here. I'll make a counteroffer to try and get closer to a fair price."

Alice is coming down, but slowly.  I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to budge a bit more. There's still a significant gap between her offer and both her valuation and John's price."

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and this price is close enough to my target range. It's not worth the risk of her backing out or my other option being unavailable if I push further."
