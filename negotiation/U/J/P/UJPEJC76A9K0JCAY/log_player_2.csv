"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  He has room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should start with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. He knows he can get the product for $15,000 elsewhere, so he has some room to maneuver."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer to $14,000. This is closer to Alice's last offer and shows he is serious about negotiating.  He knows he can buy from John for $15,000, so there's room for a deal that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's getting closer to his target price, but $16,000 is still higher than what he's willing to pay. He should keep negotiating to see if he can get a better price. He's still within his 10 rounds and has the option of buying from John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

Bob should increase his counteroffer again, but this time only by a small amount to $14,500. This shows that he's getting close to Alice's price, but is still determined to get a better deal. Since Alice is coming down in price, he knows there's a good chance she'll accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $15,800 is very close to his budget, he knows he can get the product for $15,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a better price. He has a few more rounds to work with, and he's already shown a willingness to pay close to his limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he should still try to negotiate. Offering $15,500 shows he's serious about buying from Alice but also that he's still looking for a better price.  He's one round away from having to buy from John, so this is his last chance to try and get a better deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. He has one round left, and Alice is still offering a price above his limit. While it's tempting to try one more counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and Bob could end up with no deal at all. Buying from John guarantees him the product for his target price."
