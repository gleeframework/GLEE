"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and expectations. Given its high value and the benefits it provides, we believe it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Considering the exceptional quality and unique features of this product, I am extending an exclusive offer to you. Would you be interested in acquiring it for $12,000? This price reflects the value we place on maintaining long-term relationships with our esteemed clients while ensuring a fair return on our investment. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to pay $2,000 more, even if Alice is trying to highlight the product's value. Your goal is to save money, and John's offer is the most financially sound option."
