``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This would be a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to at least get $13,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $13,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a good price.
* **Message:** The message is direct and assertive, acknowledging Bob's position but emphasizing my need to get at least $13,000. I also highlight the value of the product and the time invested in negotiation to justify my position.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** This message aims to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit below that. Would you be willing to consider $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:**  With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and ending up selling to John for $10,000 is too high. $12,500 is a reasonable price, considering my minimum value and the time invested in negotiation. 
* **Timing is crucial:**  The risk of going another round with Bob and having him reject my offer is too great at this stage.  

It's better to secure a deal with Bob now and avoid the potential for a lower price with John or the risk of no deal at all."
