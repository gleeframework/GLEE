Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the price at $950,000. This is a good balance between maximizing my profit and still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob. It avoids being too aggressive, as I still want him to consider the offer. 

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Potential for higher profit:**  Even though this price is less than my ""fallback"" price with John, it's still a significant profit for me.
* **Attractive to Bob:** While $950,000 is still a lot of money, it's less than what I would get from John, making it a more attractive deal for Bob. 
* **Minimizes risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum desired price."
