# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing further.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.
