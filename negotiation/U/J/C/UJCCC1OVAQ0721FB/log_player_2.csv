I am extending this opportunity to you to acquire it for $18000. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is too expensive for me, and I can get it from John for $12,000, which is a much better deal.
