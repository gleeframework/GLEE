Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you start the negotiation with Bob closer to that amount.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,450,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Sense of urgency:** By mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer"", you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to its value to him ($1,000,000)."
