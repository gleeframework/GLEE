"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  That gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on that.",9000.0,Bob,4,
