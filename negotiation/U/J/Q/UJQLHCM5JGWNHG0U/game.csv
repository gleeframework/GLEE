"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a compromise at $7,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $6,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $6,800. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",6800.0,Alice,5,
