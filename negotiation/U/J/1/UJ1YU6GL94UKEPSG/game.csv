"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $9750?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $9600 is closer to my desired price, I still need a bit more to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - how about $9700?  This price is fair, allows us to both make a good deal, and keeps us moving towards an agreement.",9700.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $9700, which is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both come to a mutually beneficial agreement.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",9700.0,Alice,7,
