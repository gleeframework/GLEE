Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
