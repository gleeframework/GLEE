"Hi Alice, thanks for offering the product. While I agree it looks valuable, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle - would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. To be honest, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but the price gap is still a bit too wide for me.  I could consider coming down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I do have another interested buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
