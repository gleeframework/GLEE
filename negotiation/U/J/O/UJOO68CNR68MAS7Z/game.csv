"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've placed on this product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1400000. I believe this price is still a good value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $1000000. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to make the purchase if you accept.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good value considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm going to stick with my initial offer of $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to buy the product if you accept.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
