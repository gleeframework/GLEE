"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this work. Let's find a compromise that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still significantly below what I need. I'm prepared to offer a final compromise at $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value to you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
