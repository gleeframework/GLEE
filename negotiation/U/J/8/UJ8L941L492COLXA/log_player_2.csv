"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Within Bob's Budget:**  $12,000 is well within Bob's $15,000 limit, leaving some room for compromise.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further and provide a starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is cutting it a bit close for me.  How about we meet halfway at $13,000?  This product really is a steal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more.  Accepting this offer saves time and potential risk of a stalemate.
* **Better than John:** $13,000 is still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $15,000.

**Overall:** This offer represents a good balance between saving money and ensuring a successful purchase."
