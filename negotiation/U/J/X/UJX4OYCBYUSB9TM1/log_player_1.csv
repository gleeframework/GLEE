Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant profit for me and still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, and I'm prepared to negotiate.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm aware of the fallback option of selling to John for $8,000, which provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
