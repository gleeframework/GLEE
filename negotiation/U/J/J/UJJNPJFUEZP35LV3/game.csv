"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay up to $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1075000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to me is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. After careful consideration, I am still unable to agree to a price higher than $1050000 for the product. I believe we are close enough in our valuation, and I would like to stick to that figure to ensure a fair deal for both parties.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
