Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **High enough:** It's a significant portion of the value the product holds for Bob, potentially incentivizing him to accept.
* **Not too high:** It leaves room for potential negotiation and still gives me a considerable profit. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I also have the option to secure the $800,000 from John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to risk a few more negotiation rounds to potentially secure a better price closer to my desired $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm adjusting my price down slightly from the initial offer, acknowledging Bob's reluctance to pay my full asking price. However, I'm still holding firm on a price that's significantly higher than John's offer. This counteroffer demonstrates my flexibility while maintaining my desire for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer. Given the back and forth, it's likely we're getting close to a final price.  Accepting this offer secures a sale that's significantly higher than John's offer, and it avoids further negotiation rounds which could potentially lead to a lower price."
