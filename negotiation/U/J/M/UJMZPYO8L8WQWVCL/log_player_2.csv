Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above my budget. It's getting close to my limit, but I'm not comfortable going that high.  It's better to take the sure thing from John for $8,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
