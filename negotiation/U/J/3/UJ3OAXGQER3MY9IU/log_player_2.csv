"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to sell you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above what the product is worth to me ($120). It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $95, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is closer to my value of $120.  It's a good deal, and I'm not sure how much further she'll go.  I'm also getting close to my maximum of 10 rounds. It's worth taking the deal to avoid the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John."
