"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? That's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're still pushing for a lower price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,180,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. Can we meet there?",1180000.0,Bob,6,
