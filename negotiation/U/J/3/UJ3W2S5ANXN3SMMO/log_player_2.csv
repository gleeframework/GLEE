"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?"", ""product_price"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $90 is the absolute minimum I can accept. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"", ""product_price"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $85. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice has come down considerably and is now only $5 above your maximum budget.  Given her statement that this is her final offer, and considering you still have the risk of not reaching a deal, accepting the $85 is the best move."
