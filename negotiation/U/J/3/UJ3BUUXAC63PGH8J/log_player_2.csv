Alice is still asking for too much.  I'll try another counteroffer, but if she doesn't budge much I'm going to have to consider buying from John."

Alice isn't budging much, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to go with John's offer. It's not the best price, but it's the most secure way to get the product."
