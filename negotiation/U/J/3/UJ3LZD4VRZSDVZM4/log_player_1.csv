"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is way too low for me. I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,125,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I'm getting closer to selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  To make this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
