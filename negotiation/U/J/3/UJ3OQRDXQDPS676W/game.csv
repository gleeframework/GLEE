"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. Let's try $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is getting close, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
