"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'll counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering you the product for $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I'll counter-offer again and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $11,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $11500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10750 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I've reached the point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $12,000.  Rather than continue negotiating and risk ending up with a lower price, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a sure thing, and I'm confident I'll get a better price from a future buyer."
