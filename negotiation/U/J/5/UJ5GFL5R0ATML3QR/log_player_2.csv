"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $900,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Buying from John is not a good option yet.**  John's price is your absolute maximum, so it's better to see if you can get a better deal from Alice first.

**Next Steps:**

You'll make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round, aiming to get the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate seriously while also showing that you value the product.
* **Strategic Midpoint:** $750,000 is roughly the midpoint between Alice's desired price ($800,000) and your maximum willingness to pay ($1,200,000). This creates a fair starting point for further bargaining.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Alice's Response:** See if Alice accepts your counteroffer or makes a counter-counteroffer. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate further:** If Alice rejects, be prepared to adjust your counteroffer based on her response. You have 8 rounds remaining to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is worse than her initial offer:**  Alice is asking for more than her initial price of $900,000.  This is a bad sign, and suggests she may be unwilling to negotiate seriously.
* **John is still a viable option:**  While John's price is high, it's still within your budget. You can afford to keep negotiating with Alice, but John remains a safe fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to be careful in your next counteroffer.  Alice has shown a willingness to move her price up, so you need to be firm but also avoid driving her away completely."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Alice's minimum:**  This offer matches Alice's stated minimum value for the product. It shows you understand her needs while still attempting to keep the price lower.
* **Testing the waters:**  Alice's previous increase in her offer suggests she might be willing to negotiate. This offer is a test to see if she's truly committed to her stated minimum or if she's willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Alice's Response:**  If Alice accepts this offer, you get a good deal.  If she rejects, you'll need to consider if her counteroffer is acceptable or if you should move towards buying from John.
* **Prepare for potential concessions:** If Alice rejects, you might need to adjust your offer slightly upwards. You still have time, but you want to be prepared for a potential compromise."
