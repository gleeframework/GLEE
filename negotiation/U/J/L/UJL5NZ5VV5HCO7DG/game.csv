"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However, $10500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm prepared to pay $9500, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
