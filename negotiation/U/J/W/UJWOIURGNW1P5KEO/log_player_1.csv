Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I value the product highly, which might make Bob more serious about buying it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I will reject this offer and counteroffer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility. However, it still reflects the product's value to me.  It's a compromise that could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$750,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now offering my minimum acceptable price. This is a strong signal that I'm serious about selling to Bob, but I won't go lower. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while, and while he's increased his offer, it's still not at a point where it's worth it for me.  John's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing that guaranteed sale. It's time to sell to John."
