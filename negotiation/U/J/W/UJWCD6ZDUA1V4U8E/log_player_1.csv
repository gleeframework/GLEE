Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to him, while still giving me a good profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer carefully and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation. I'll always have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if I'm not satisfied with Bob's offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I'll accept his offer to avoid further negotiations."
