"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I think it's a great deal for you, as I know it's quite valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within my budget, it's not the best deal. I'm willing to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to explore better options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $95 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a very fair price for this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my target price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price.  It's worth exploring if I can get it closer to $85. There are still 7 rounds left, so I'm not rushing to a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $90 is still a little high for me.  How about $87?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to purchase the item within my budget."", ""product_price"": 87}
