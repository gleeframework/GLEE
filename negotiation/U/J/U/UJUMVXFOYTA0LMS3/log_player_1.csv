{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a fair price considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $110?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $105 is a good deal.  It's still above the value I'd get from selling to John, and it seems like Bob is firm on his price.  It's time to finalize the sale."
