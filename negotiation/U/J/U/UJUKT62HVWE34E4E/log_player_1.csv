"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this price represents a fair and attractive proposition for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're beginning with a strong offer slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while establishing a firm stance.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, aiming to influence Bob's perception. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer acknowledges that it's a starting point, implicitly inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This price would be more in line with my budget and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to his perceived value than mine. While accepting would secure a profit, it's too early to settle. We have ample rounds to negotiate, and I have the security of John's offer. Rejecting now signals I'm aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 falls short of reflecting that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($25,000 instead of $50,000), indicating I'm getting closer to my bottom line. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again highlights the product's worth, aiming to gently steer Bob's perception away from his initial $1,000,000 valuation. 
* **Open for Continued Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging Bob to counter and hopefully bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,125,000. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,075,000. This price reflects my confidence in the product's value, but also my need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but I'm still in a strong position. Bob is consistently moving towards my price point, indicating he's motivated.  I'm confident I can still negotiate a better deal than $1,075,000 before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I respect your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close the gap – I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer, representing a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Finality:**  The message uses phrases like ""close the gap"" and ""fair and final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and suggest that this is my bottom line.
* **Significant Concession:** I'm making a more substantial concession of $25,000, demonstrating a strong willingness to close the deal.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** Despite the concession, I'm holding firm above the $1,100,000 mark, emphasizing that I'm not willing to go below a certain threshold.

By making a significant move and setting a firm tone, this offer encourages Bob to seriously consider accepting. It also prepares the ground for a potential shift in strategy in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $1,075,000, but I still have room to negotiate and time on my side. By rejecting again, I signal that I'm not giving in easily. It's a calculated risk, as Bob might not budge, but it keeps the door open for a higher offer. I'll use the next round to gauge his commitment and potentially adjust my strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've been very clear about the product's value. I'm willing to make one final move to show my commitment to getting this done. Let's settle at $1,090,000 – this is my absolute bottom line.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimatum Time:** I'm setting a firm boundary with ""one final move"" and ""absolute bottom line"" language. This creates a sense of urgency and signals I'm prepared to walk away.
* **Slight Concession, Strategic Positioning:** The $10,000 decrease is small, showing I'm not budging much. It keeps the price above $1,080,000, potentially leaving room for a final split down the middle if Bob counters.
* **Introducing Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob that I have a strong alternative in John and am not desperate to close the deal at any cost.

This is a high-pressure, high-reward play. It risks pushing Bob away, but it could finally break the stalemate and lead to a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to make one final move, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away. Bob countered my ""final offer"" with a lower price, signaling he's unlikely to move significantly closer to my target. Accepting his offer at $1,060,000 would be a $140,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,200,000.  

While there's a slim chance Bob could drastically improve his offer in the next two rounds, it's too risky. John's offer provides certainty and secures the best possible outcome in this situation."
