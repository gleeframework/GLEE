Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've set the initial price at $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves me with a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer and highlighting the value he'll receive.  
* **Strategy:**  I'm starting high, but I'm prepared to negotiate. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only commit to a maximum of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product.  I can try to negotiate a higher price.
* **John as leverage:**  Having John as a backup option gives me the power to walk away if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory point. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and attempt to bridge the gap between our desired prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have a budget in mind. While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,500.  This would still be a great price for you, given the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $11,500, which is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing the benefit of this price for him.
* **Strategy:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground that's attractive to Bob while still remaining profitable for me. 
* **Next Steps:** I'm prepared to further negotiate if necessary, but I have John as a fallback option if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still unable to go above $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is unwilling to budge from his $10,000 offer, and this is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation seems unlikely to produce a favorable outcome for me.
* **John is the better option:** Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a higher price, it's a risky gamble. John's offer is a sure thing, and I don't want to risk missing out on a guaranteed deal. 

Therefore, selling to John is the most rational and profitable choice in this scenario."
