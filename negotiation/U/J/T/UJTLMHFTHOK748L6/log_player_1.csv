Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum price because I know John is willing to pay that much. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I hope this will encourage him to accept, but I'm still willing to walk away if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to make one more counteroffer and if he doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

This is my final offer. It's still above my minimum price, but I'm willing to go down a bit more to try and secure a deal with Bob. If he rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he's not willing to meet my price. I've already made several concessions, and I don't want to continue this negotiation any further. John is a sure thing, and I'm happy to sell to him for my minimum price."
