"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's capabilities.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise. However, $812,500 is still a significant gap from what I consider fair for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I can offer it for $900,000. This is my final offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
