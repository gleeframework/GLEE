Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation of the product's capabilities."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Perhaps we can find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $812,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is strategically moving towards a middle ground, but we're still significantly below my minimum. It's too early to settle; I need to show I'm willing to walk away if necessary to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise. However, $812,500 is still a significant gap from what I consider fair for this product. To demonstrate my willingness to negotiate, I can offer it for $900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** I'm setting a firm tone by stating this is my final offer, introducing a sense of urgency. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($75,000 instead of $162,500), signaling I'm reaching my limit.
* **Pressure:** This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a price closer to my target or risk losing the deal entirely."
