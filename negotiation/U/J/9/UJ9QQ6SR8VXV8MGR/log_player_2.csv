"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is within your budget, it's still a significant price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $9,000 is still more than I want to pay. I'm going to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down. However,  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, I'm still not comfortable going lower than $8,900.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $8,900. This is only $100 more than my ideal price of $8,800. Considering that I have limited rounds, accepting her offer seems like the best option.  I would potentially lose $100 by going to John, and I can't be sure that I can negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds."
