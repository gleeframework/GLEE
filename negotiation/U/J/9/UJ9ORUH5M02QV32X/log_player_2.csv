"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as low a price as possible. $110 is still a bit too high for him, considering his maximum budget is $120. He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** Bob is starting with a significant counter-offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This shows Alice he is serious about buying but wants a good deal. 
* **Price point:** $95 is a good starting point as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation strategy:** Bob wants to keep the price as low as possible. While $102.5 is closer to his target, it's still above his ideal price point. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so Bob can likely get a lower price with another counter-offer.
* **Avoiding Jhon:** Buying from Jhon at this point would mean spending more than what Alice is now offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $102.50. Let's try $98.50. It's closer to what I can afford, and I'm sure this product will be worth it to me too."", ""product_price"": 98.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying within budget:** Bob is still trying to stay within his ideal price range while showing a willingness to compromise further.
* **Small increments:** The counter-offer is only $4 lower than Alice's last offer, demonstrating a gradual approach to closing the gap.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  The message emphasizes Bob's continued interest and belief in the product's value to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic."
