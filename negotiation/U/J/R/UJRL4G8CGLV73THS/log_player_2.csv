"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer is still too high. You can potentially negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $11,000, which is my previous offer, and we can consider it a final compromise. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

At this point, it's likely that Alice is firm on her price.  You can save $1,000 by accepting her offer, compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise that allows both of you to get what you want."
