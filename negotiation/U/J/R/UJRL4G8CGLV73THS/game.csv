"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,200, which is still a good deal for you, and closer to my minimum price.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $10,800? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,4,
