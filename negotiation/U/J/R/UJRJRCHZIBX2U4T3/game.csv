"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $65. How about we meet in the middle at $82? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'm ready to make the deal right now if you agree.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $85? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to sweeten the deal for you.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the effort you're putting in to find a price we can both agree on. To be honest, $85 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $78 - that's my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I completely understand, but I'll have to go with a different option.",78.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that $85 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $82.50? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal.",82.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. $80 is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I understand, but I'll have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,8,
