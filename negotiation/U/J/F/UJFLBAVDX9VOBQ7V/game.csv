"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm a bit surprised by the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  Let's find a compromise at $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $950,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can we meet in the middle?",975000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I value your continued interest in this product. While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still slightly below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to move forward.",1025000.0,Alice,5,,
