Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm a bit surprised by the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is too far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000.  Let's find a compromise at $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $950,000, so I'll offer $975,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $975,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your continued interest in this product. While I appreciate your offer, $975,000 is still slightly below my minimum.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $990,000, so I'll offer $995,000. I'm hoping we can finally find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, we're getting very close to my minimum price, and I'm starting to run out of time. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I can avoid the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer."
