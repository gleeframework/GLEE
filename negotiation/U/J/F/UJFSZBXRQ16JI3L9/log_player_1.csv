Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* It leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob.
* It's still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $1,500,000. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my profit while also considering the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I could accept this offer and make a profit, I can potentially do better by rejecting and counteroffering. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him I'm serious about getting a better price. It also creates a sense of urgency for him, as he risks losing the deal if he doesn't meet my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a compromise:

* It's higher than Bob's offer of $1,200,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* It's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000, showing I'm also willing to adjust my expectations.
* It's within my acceptable range, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to accept, while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I could accept and make a small profit,  it's not worth the continued negotiation. It's more beneficial to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 and secure a guaranteed sale. 

By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who seems unwilling to meet my minimum price. This ensures I get a guaranteed profit and avoids the potential for further delays or a stalemate in the negotiation."
