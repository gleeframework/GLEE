"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a decent offer, I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  It's worth trying to get closer to that value.  John is a solid backup, so there's no pressure to rush into a deal with Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth while still being attractive to you."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $800,000. I'll see if I can push Bob a little higher before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm  really trying to work with you here, but $750,000 is just too low. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This is my final offer before I have to seriously consider other options."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$775,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  With John as an option, I'm willing to keep pushing for a price closer to $800,000. There are still a few rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to sell at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already meeting you halfway. If you're serious about this, let's close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $795000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $795,000 is close to my minimum, I'm just $5,000 away from John's offer.  It's worth pushing for that last bit to see if Bob is willing to go higher.  We have two rounds left, so there's still time to see if we can get closer to my target."

Round 9
