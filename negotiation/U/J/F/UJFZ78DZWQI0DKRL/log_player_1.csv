``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but still lower than the product's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation, while still giving me a chance to get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my value for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This still allows you to get a great value, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
