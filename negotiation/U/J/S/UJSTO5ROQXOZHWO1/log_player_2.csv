Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $118 is still within your acceptable range of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up paying the full $120 to John. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with."
