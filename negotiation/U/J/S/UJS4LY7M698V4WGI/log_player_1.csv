Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,200,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.
