"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than $1,200,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still a little below where I need to be. How about $975,000? This is a small step closer to your offer, and it gives us both a good outcome. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $962,500. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",962500.0,Bob,6,
