"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000 at this point. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1200000 again, or I can offer you a compromise at $1100000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1050000. This is a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my limits. Let's finalize the deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let's try one more time to meet in the middle. I'll offer you $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this incredible product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1025000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975000, which is a fair compromise.  We're getting close to a deal, and I don't want to lose this opportunity.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of no return. I'll make one final offer: $1000000. This is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",1000000.0,Alice,9,
