"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1200000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the adjustment, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to reach a fair agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, so I'll counter with a price of $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $1025000, but I'm prepared to go up to $1000000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that this is the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that you're serious about the product. I'll counter with a price of $1075000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
