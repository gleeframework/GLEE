"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $100? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer if you don't want to go lower.",80.0,Bob,4,
