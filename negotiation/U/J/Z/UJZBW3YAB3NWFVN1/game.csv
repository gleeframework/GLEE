"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its worth no less than $15000 to me.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $16000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be careful with my finances. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $15800. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",15800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $15800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14900. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14900.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate all the concessions you've made, but $15100 is still a bit too high for me. I've been considering buying the product from John for $15000, and I'm starting to think that's the best option for me. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $14900. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",14900.0,Bob,10,
