"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000. This means she's still willing to make a profit, and there's likely room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that should balance our interests and allow us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target of $800,000. There's still potential for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget, while ensuring you still realize a good profit."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while also considering the value you're placing on the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $980,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still over Bob's target of $800,000.  At this point, Bob has reached his limit and is willing to accept a lower-value product from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice."
