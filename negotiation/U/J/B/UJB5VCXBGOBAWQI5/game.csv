"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $8,500.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $8,750.  I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset to my business, and I'm hopeful we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,200 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Let's meet in the middle again at $8,900.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a strong addition to my business.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",8900.0,Bob,6,
