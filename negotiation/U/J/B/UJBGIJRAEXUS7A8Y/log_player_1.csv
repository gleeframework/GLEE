Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob's perceived value is lower than yours, it's always best to start negotiations higher than their perceived value and lower than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without directly revealing your minimum. 
* **Targeting the Middle:** The offered price of $1,300,000 aims for a potential win-win. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but offers you a substantial profit over what John is offering.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a great deal at $1,300,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to negotiate down while staying above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer and sell it for your minimum acceptable price."
