"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum acceptable value. It also encourages Bob to engage by asking for his opinion. This sets the stage for potential counteroffers and allows you to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $15,000. It's better to reject his offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This still leaves room for negotiation but is closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to come down to $17000, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable value, it's still below the $15,000 you could get from John. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can squeeze out a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $14,500. This feels like a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to offer $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum, the offer is still below the $15,000 you can get from John.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum value."
