"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum, but it allows for potential compromise.
* **Open Communication:**  I'm inviting Bob to discuss the offer and potentially counter, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and the possibility of a higher offer from Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  Even if I don't reach my desired price with Bob, I have the security of John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a good compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing I'm committed to reaching a deal.
* **Remaining Above Minimum:**  $1,350,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell myself short.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching a decision, pushing for a conclusion to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my minimum.  
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** We've already been through several rounds of counteroffers, and further negotiation may not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only six rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of the negotiation collapsing.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, it's not a guarantee. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and minimizes potential delays."
