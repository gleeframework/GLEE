""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his perceived value leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob counters, it's unlikely he'll go much lower than $14,000, which is still a significant profit for you.  The guaranteed sale to John at $10,000 provides a safety net."
