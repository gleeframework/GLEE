"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $1000000? I believe this might bring us closer to finding a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your compromise. However, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1100000. This is my best offer, considering my financial situation. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
