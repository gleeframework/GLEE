"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to a more agreeable price. Would you consider selling the product for $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I see your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000. This still allows me to save some money while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise, but $775,000 still falls short of what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway once again and offer the product for $800,000. This is my final offer. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John at that price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
