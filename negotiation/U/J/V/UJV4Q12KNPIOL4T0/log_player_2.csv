Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the gesture, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final concession.  While we could try to push for a slightly better price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her refusing and the deal falling through. Accepting at $1,045,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of going to John and paying $1,200,000."
