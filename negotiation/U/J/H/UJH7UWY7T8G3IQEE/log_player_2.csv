"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This gives you a fair price and allows me to reach a more acceptable value for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I need to see at least $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

At this point, Alice has met your ideal price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal.  It's best to accept the offer now."
