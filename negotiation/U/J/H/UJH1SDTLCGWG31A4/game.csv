"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is a little too low for me. How about $115? That's still a good deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $112 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $113? I really think this product is worth it, and I'm confident we can make this work.",113.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $111? I'm really close to walking away and buying from John at $120.,111.0,Bob,6,
