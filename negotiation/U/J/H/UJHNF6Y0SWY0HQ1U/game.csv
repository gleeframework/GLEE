"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is way too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $120? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $100.  Let's meet in the middle.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $115? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really committed to getting this product, but my absolute maximum is $105. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
