"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her ($1,500,000), it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is always an option, but Bob should try to get a better deal from Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to his target price, Bob should continue negotiating to try and get it even lower. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is always a fallback option, but Bob should try to get a better price from Alice before resorting to that."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,320,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  It's more advantageous for Bob to accept John's offer and secure the product at his budget-friendly price of $1,200,000."
