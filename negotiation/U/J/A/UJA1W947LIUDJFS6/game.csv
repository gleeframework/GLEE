"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to offer $1250000. This is a fair price considering my budget, and it's a significant step towards reaching an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your target price, but $1350000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1300000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product, but I'm unable to go any higher.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
