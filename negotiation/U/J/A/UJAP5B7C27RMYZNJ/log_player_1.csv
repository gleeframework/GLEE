Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John), you can be a bit bolder with Bob. Aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not desperate, so project confidence. 
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  This implies that you've considered both sides, even though you're aiming high.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation is Dynamic:** Be prepared to adjust your price slightly if Bob counters. 
* **Don't Reveal Your Hand:** Never tell Bob about your deal with John.
* **Be Professional and Respectful:** Maintain a positive tone throughout the negotiation."
