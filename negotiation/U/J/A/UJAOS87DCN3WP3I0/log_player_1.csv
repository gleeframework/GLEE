Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so aiming high is ideal. However, being too greedy could lead to rejection. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Alice's minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,200,000) if Bob declines. This knowledge empowers Alice to aim higher with Bob."
