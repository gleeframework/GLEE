"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",820000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our conversation, I'm still holding out for a price that better reflects the true value of this product.  How about $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with your purchase.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not sure $850,000 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm committed to finding a deal, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference -  how about $837,500?  This is a fair price that gives both of us something to be happy with.  What do you say?",837500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $837,500. I'd like to get closer to my target price, so I'm willing to offer $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Bob,6,
