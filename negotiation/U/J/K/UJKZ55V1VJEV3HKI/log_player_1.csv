{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than what Bob believes the product is worth, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'm leaving room to potentially negotiate further if necessary.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $820,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our conversation, I'm still holding out for a price that better reflects the true value of this product.  How about $850,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with your purchase.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer.  This shows flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you value the product highly, but I'm still not sure $850,000 is the right price for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price or move on to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm committed to finding a deal, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference -  how about $837,500?  This is a fair price that gives both of us something to be happy with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 837500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $837,500. I'd like to get closer to my target price, so I'm willing to offer $810,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $810,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've already reached a point where it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000. Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price and risks losing John as a buyer entirely."
