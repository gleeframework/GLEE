"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,200,000. This is intentionally above Bob's perceived value of $800,000,  but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a middle ground. If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price. I still have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping the price from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm feeling the pressure to get a deal done, $850,000 is still too low for me.  I am confident that I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll counter-offer again and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still fair, considering Bob's perceived value of $800,000 and my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. This offer leaves room for some negotiation while still ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price. While I would like to close a deal with Bob, I don't want to compromise too much. I'm running out of rounds, and the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is becoming too high.  Therefore, I'm choosing to sell to John, ensuring I receive my minimum desired price of $1,000,000."
