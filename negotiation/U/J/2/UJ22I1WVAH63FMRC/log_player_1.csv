Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a price close to its value to me. However, I am hoping to keep my investment within a specific budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $1000000? I understand that might be below your initial asking price, but I believe this would be a mutually beneficial compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round.
