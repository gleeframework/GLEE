"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you is $1500000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a price close to its value to me. However, I am hoping to keep my investment within a specific budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to $1000000? I understand that might be below your initial asking price, but I believe this would be a mutually beneficial compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within a budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the value of the product to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, given my financial constraints, I'm unable to agree to $1250000. I believe we could reach a compromise closer to $1100000. I hope this suggestion will be acceptable and lead us towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
