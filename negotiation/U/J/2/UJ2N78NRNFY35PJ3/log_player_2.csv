"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can do better than $1,400,000, as John is selling the product for $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

Alice's offer is $1,325,000, which is still more than John's offer of $1,200,000. It's better to buy the product from John and save $125,000."
