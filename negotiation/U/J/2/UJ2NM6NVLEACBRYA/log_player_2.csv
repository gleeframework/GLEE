This offer reflects a fair price for both of us and gives us a solid starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of our costs and the value we place on this product, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. We hope this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price range, it's still above what I'm comfortable with. I want to save as much money as possible, so I'll continue to negotiate and try to get the price down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product.  This offer is a good compromise and ensures a successful deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. To move forward, we propose a price of $885,000. This price reflects our costs and the value we believe the product holds for you. We hope this aligns with your expectations and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is getting very close to my desired price range.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and we'll waste more time. Additionally, buying from John for $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive. Accepting this offer allows me to save money and close the deal."
