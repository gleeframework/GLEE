{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $999,999 is still very close to the $1,000,000 price from John.  There's potential to get a slightly better deal with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to start by making a significant counteroffer. $900,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. This will give Alice a clear indication that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice has come down a bit, but $950,000 is still too high. I'm going to try and push for a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $925,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down slowly. While $940,000 is closer to my target, I believe I can still get a better price.  We're halfway through the rounds, and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is getting closer to my target price. With only 3 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Accepting $935,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000."
