"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to send a clear message that you're looking for a price within a reasonable range. By rejecting this offer, you initiate the negotiation process and can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in a price closer to the $700,000 range. Let me know if that's something you can consider."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Starting significantly lower than your actual limit ($800,000) gives you room for negotiation while signaling you're serious about a good deal.
* **Anchoring:** By introducing a number significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, you attempt to anchor the negotiation around a more favorable price point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that this is a starting point, leaving room for Alice to counter and continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value I know this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down, the price is still significantly above your $800,000 limit. Accepting would mean overpaying substantially.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate indicates there might be flexibility. Continuing the negotiation allows you to potentially reach a more agreeable price.
* **Alternative Exists:** You have the option to buy from John at $800,000, giving you leverage and a fallback position if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. To be candid, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000 for this purchase. If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:**  You're now being upfront about your absolute maximum budget. This establishes a clear boundary and prevents wasted time if Alice is unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other options"" subtly implies you might walk away from the deal, encouraging Alice to consider your offer more seriously.
* **Final Offer:** Presenting your maximum budget as your counteroffer signals this is your best possible price. It leaves the ball in Alice's court to either accept a substantial profit or risk losing the sale."
