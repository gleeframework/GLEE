"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in a price closer to the $700,000 range. Let me know if that's something you can consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the value I know this product holds.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. To be candid, I'm working with a maximum of $800,000 for this purchase. If you're able to work within that range, I'm very interested. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
