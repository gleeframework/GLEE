"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $100 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $125 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and do $112?",112.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $112. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
