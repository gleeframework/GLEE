"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,050,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you countering, Bob. It shows you're serious. While $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider right now, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving closer to my price range, Alice.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. Could we settle on $1,075,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
