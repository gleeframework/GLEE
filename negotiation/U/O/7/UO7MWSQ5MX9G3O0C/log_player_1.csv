Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a higher price than John's offer.
* **High but Reasonable:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but the message aims to frame it as a ""great deal"" to pique his interest. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial situation or how much he might be willing to stretch his budget."
