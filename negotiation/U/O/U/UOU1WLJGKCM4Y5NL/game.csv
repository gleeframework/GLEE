"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1700000. It's still a fair price considering its potential, and it gives us both room to negotiate further. I'm confident this product will be a great asset for your business.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
