I'm starting with a high price to see if I can get close to my minimum. I know the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, so I'm pricing it higher to leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can adjust the price. I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John, willing to pay $15,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$12,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum of $15,000 before selling. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $14,000, which is still above my minimum. This should be a more reasonable offer for Bob, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$13,000 is close enough to my minimum, and I don't want to risk Bob walking away or spending too much time negotiating.  I'm happy to take the deal."
