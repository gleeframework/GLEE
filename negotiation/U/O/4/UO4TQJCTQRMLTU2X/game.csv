"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even more value for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, a price that reflects both our needs.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800,000 to $900,000. I hope we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too far below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit further to meet you halfway. I'd accept $1,050,000, reflecting a compromise on both sides. This price still gives me a decent return on my investment, while also allowing you to acquire a product that's worth $1,000,000 to your business.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair for both parties and aligns closely with the value I place on the product. I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
