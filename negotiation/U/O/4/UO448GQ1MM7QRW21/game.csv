"Alice, your initial price is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value and potential impact on your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
