"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is well over $8000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $9000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $7500?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. This is a very competitive price, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $8200 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm still very interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $7800.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while also allowing me to stay within my budget. I believe this is a fair offer for both of us.",7800.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $8000. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering you the product for $8100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $8100 is closer to where I want to be, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $7900, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's close this deal!",7900.0,Bob,6,
