"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $150? That's the absolute max I can do.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I've got to make a living, you know. I can do $165, and that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $157.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy now.",157.5,Bob,4,

"Alright Bob, I see you're a shrewd negotiator! I can do $162.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really appreciate the quality. Let's meet in the middle.",162.5,Alice,5,
