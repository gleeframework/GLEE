"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to meet your specific needs and offers exceptional value. Considering its quality and benefits, I propose a price of $95 for it. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its worth while allowing us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate but I can always get the product for $80 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($65) to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves room for me to increase my offer in later rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $75 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still higher than what I can get it from John. I'll reject this offer and propose something closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $75 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more affordable.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

I'm nudging the price closer to my target of $80,  trying to find a balance between saving money and potentially securing the deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback, I'm willing to offer the product at $72. This price still allows us to maintain a healthy profit margin while making the product more affordable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $72, which is a good deal compared to John's $80 price. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and I'm happy to save $8."
