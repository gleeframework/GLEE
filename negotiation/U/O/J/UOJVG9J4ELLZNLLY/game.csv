"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still leave us both with a good deal, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
