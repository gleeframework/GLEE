"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if it's a much better deal. How about $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  However, $650,000 is too far below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving some on the price, but $950,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could go up to $725,000 if you're serious about selling.",725000.0,Bob,4,
