# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get the ball rolling.

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price point, closer to  $700,000?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle on $800,000? That's a fair offer, and it allows me to get a good deal while ensuring you still make a profit."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a good price for you, but I'm not sure if it's enough for me to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $900,000. It's clear she's firm on that price point. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes no financial sense to continue negotiating with Alice.  You maximize your savings by taking John's offer."
