"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm confident we can make this work.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $125 is a little too low for me.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle at $135?  That's still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make this work.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about $130?  That's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to make a deal at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and we're getting closer.  $130 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.  Let's close this deal!",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're so close!  I'm really hoping we can make this work.  Would you be willing to come down to $128?  That's a very fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",128.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $128 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $130.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,7,
