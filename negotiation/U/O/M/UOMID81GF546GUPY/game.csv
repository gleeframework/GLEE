,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant and  $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,275,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but I can't go below $1,300,000 for this product. It's an exceptional offer for something of this value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
