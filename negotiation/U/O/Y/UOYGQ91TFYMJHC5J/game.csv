"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the competitive price, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $600,000 for the product?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  $700,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $650,000?  That would work much better for my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $680,000. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's meet in the middle again and see if we can come to an agreement.",680000.0,Alice,5,
