"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $102.50? That way we both get a good deal.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit above my budget with that price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.,105.0,Bob,4,
