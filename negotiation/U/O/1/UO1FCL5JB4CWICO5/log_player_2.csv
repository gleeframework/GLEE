Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this discussion. I understand where you're coming from with your budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be transparent, $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line for this product.  Considering its value and the effort that went into it, anything less wouldn't be fair to me. If you're able to meet me at that price point, I'm happy to close the deal today. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.

Alice has revealed her absolute bottom line is $1,200,000, which is far above your budget and what John is offering.  There's no point in continuing negotiations.  It's time to buy from John."
