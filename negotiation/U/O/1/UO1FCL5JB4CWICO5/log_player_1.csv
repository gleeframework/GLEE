"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm explicitly stating my willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. While it's a step up from his perceived value, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially with the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the benefits it offers. Could you consider something closer to $1,050,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing understanding for his position. 
* **Standing Firm (For Now):** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($50,000 instead of $150,000) to signal that I'm not going to drastically drop the price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to nudge Bob towards a higher offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While firm, my tone remains collaborative and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a significant way off from my $1,200,000 minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see Bob moving more towards my range. I'll use the next counteroffer to try and nudge him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to continue this discussion. I understand where you're coming from with your budget, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To be transparent, $1,200,000 is my absolute bottom line for this product.  Considering its value and the effort that went into it, anything less wouldn't be fair to me. If you're able to meet me at that price point, I'm happy to close the deal today. Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:** I'm being completely transparent with Bob about my minimum price. This builds trust and shows him I'm serious.
* **Firm but Fair:** I'm not budging on my minimum but am framing it as a necessity rather than an ultimatum.
* **Introducing Urgency:** By mentioning ""other options"" (John), I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive. 
* **Aiming for the Close:**  My goal with this counteroffer is to secure the $1,200,000. By laying out my position clearly, I'm hoping Bob will meet my price or present a strong counter-argument."
