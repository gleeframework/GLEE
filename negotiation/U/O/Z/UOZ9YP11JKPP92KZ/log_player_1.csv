Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. Let's say $120.  What do you think? "", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're still making a profit of $40.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob a sense of a good deal and makes him more likely to accept. 

Let me know if you want to adjust the offer based on how Bob responds!"
