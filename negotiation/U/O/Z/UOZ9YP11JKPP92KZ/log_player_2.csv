"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. Let's say $120.  What do you think?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While Alice's offer is below my maximum price, I suspect I can get it for less. Her message tries to inflate the perceived value, and I have a backup option with John."
