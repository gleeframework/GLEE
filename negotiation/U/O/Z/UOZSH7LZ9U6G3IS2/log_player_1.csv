Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,575,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from it. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,475,000 is a significant profit above your minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer entirely."
