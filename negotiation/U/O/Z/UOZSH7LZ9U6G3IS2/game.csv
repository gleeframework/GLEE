"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from it.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your interest and I'm motivated to make this work. How about we settle at $1,575,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true value of what's being offered.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,575,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the market value and the benefits I'll gain from it. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to stay within my budget.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
