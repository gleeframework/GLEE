"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit you greatly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still allows you to make a profit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a good profit for me and closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
