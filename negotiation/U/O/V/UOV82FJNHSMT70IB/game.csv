"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a fair deal. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10500. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer the product to you for $11200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",10800.0,Bob,6,
