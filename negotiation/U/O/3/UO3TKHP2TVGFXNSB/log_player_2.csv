"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you.  I know it's valued at $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very advantageous for both of us.  Consider this my best offer: $1,400,000.  This price ensures a solid profit for me while still leaving you with a substantial gain.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, it's still quite high. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal. You're willing to walk away and go to John if necessary, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
