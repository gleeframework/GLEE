# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,400,000. I believe this price point reflects the product's worth while still offering you significant value.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You're still better off rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price. If you're not able to get a price you're happy with, you can always buy from John."
