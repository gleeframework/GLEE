"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from $15,000, and I think $13,000 is a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at $13,000, I'm willing to make a deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
