"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price that reflects its value, but is also very competitive.  I'm confident it will be a great asset to you.  Let's discuss a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.
