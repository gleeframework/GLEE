"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  I believe this price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us, given the value I see in the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
