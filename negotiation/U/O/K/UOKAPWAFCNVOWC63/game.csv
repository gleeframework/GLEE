"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it can bring to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value this product holds for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad you're serious about the product. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair deal. My next offer is $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and my willingness to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product, while respecting your need for a reasonable profit.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $750,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to the maximum I'm willing to go. My next offer is $1,075,000. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  Let's make this simple. I'm willing to offer my final price of $780,000. It's a strong offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point of no return. My next offer is $1,050,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
