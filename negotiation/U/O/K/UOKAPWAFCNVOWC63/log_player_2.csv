Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point of no return. My next offer is $1,050,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's becoming clear that Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,050,000.  While she offered ""additional perks,"" it's impossible to know their value and they may not be worthwhile. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to take the guaranteed deal and avoid potentially wasting another round of negotiation."
