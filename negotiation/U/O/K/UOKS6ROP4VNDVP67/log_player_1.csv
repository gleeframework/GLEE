""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting high but slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum acceptable price.

This offer balances a strong opening price with the flexibility to negotiate, maximizing your potential profit."
