"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $14,000. I believe this product will be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price from Alice, as she values the product at $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is now within your budget ($15,000) and is closer to your desired price than John's offer.  Accepting this offer saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the potential savings are small, and accepting this offer minimizes risk and secures the product."
