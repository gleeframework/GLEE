{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss the price, showing flexibility and encouraging a back-and-forth.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even below his own perceived value of $8,000. Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me. 

Instead, I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price, aiming for a more reasonable compromise.  John is a strong safety net, giving me the leverage to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $6,000 is simply not enough for me. Considering its quality and value, I can't go lower than $10,000.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it's still a fair offer for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a strong position:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door entirely. Instead, I'm proposing a counteroffer that is still significantly higher than his initial offer but closer to his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's ""quality and value"" to justify my counteroffer.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm using language like ""significant discount"" and ""fair offer"" to frame my counteroffer as a compromise and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go lower than $10,000 because it's still above my minimum acceptable price and I have John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle on $7,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm aiming to maximize my profit and John's offer of $15,000 provides a significant safety net.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Negotiate further:** I can attempt to push for a higher price in the next round.
* **Maintain leverage:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, so I can hold firm in my negotiations.
* **Secure a better deal:**  There's a chance Bob will increase his offer or I might be able to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing the negotiation:** I'm still engaging with Bob to try and find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's current offer of $7,500. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still holding onto a substantial profit.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce the justification for my price.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I'm not settling for a loss.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing this offer as ""fair"" to encourage Bob's acceptance.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining my negotiation leverage, keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $9,000 is still pushing it. My absolute best offer is $8,000.  That's the most I'm willing to spend, and I think it's a very fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of further negotiation and potential stalemate isn't worth it.  

I've already reached a point where John's offer provides a much more favorable outcome. It's time to close the deal with John and secure a significant profit."
