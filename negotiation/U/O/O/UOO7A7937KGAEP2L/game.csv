"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify the price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,4,
