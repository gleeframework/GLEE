Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can justify the price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price before I lose more potential profit. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is a safer bet at this point."
