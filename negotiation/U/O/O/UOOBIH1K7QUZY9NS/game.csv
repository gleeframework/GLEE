"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering its value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm feeling confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $1,062,500.  It's a fair middle ground between our last two offers.",1062500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,062,500. I'll offer it to you for $1,070,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product.",1070000.0,Alice,5,
