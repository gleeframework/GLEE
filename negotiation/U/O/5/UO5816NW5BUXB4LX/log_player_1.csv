"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. I'm hoping he'll counter, and we can negotiate a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer you $95 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your price. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to offer $100 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum price of $100.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's risky.  If I reject his offer and he doesn't counter, I'll be forced to sell to John at the same price.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
