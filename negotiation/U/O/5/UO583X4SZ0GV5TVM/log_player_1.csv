Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to appeal to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle, which would still be a profit for me.

By starting high, I maximize my chances of securing a deal significantly above my minimum acceptable price."
