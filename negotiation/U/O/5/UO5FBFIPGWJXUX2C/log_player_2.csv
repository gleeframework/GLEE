"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $9500. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can still potentially get a better price by negotiating further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. While $9,500 is closer to my range, I'm aiming for something a bit lower.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the product price at $9000? This is a fair midpoint between our previous offers, allowing you to stay within your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go right now. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit from the sale."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and am willing to adjust our offer further. How about setting the product price at $8900? This is a step towards meeting your budget while still ensuring a decent return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is a very good price, Bob has already used 4 rounds of negotiation, and he can buy the product from John for $8,000. With the limited rounds available, the risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a worse offer is not worth the potential small savings.  He should secure the product from John and avoid further risk."
