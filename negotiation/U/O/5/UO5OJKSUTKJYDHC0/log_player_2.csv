"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $9,500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal value of $8,000. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal value of $8,000. Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility by dropping her price.  There's still room for further negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm prepared to offer $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can agree."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $9,250, this is still higher than Bob's ideal value of $8,000.  Bob has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has only one round left before having to buy from John at $10,000. It's worth taking one more risk to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal.  While $9,250 is tempting, it's still not quite in my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm not willing to go below $9,500, which is the minimum price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter with $9,125. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds remaining before having to buy from John at $10,000. While Alice's offer of $9,125 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal value, it's a better deal than buying from John. Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of not getting the product and losing the opportunity to buy it at a lower price.  Furthermore, Bob has already proven his willingness to negotiate, and further attempts may not yield significant price reductions."
