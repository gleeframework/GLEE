"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am thrilled to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offer leaves space for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, influencing Bob's perception.

By starting high, we aim to anchor the negotiation in our favor while gauging Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both our initial asking price and Bob's perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price. Selling to John for $800,000 is our backup option but not ideal at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By coming down to $1,000,000, we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the product's potential to remind Bob of its worth beyond his initial offer.
* **Seeking Compromise:** ""Meeting halfway"" suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating interest. However, the gap between his offer ($950,000) and our target (closer to $1,000,000) is still significant. We are willing to negotiate further but not at the cost of a substantial profit loss. We still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to come up to $975,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We hold firm on our price target but show flexibility by making a smaller concession ($25,000). 
* **Simplified Proposal:** By presenting a single price, we create a sense of urgency and encourage a decision from Bob.
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The tone remains confident, implying this is our best offer. We're getting closer to our walk-away point and need to gauge Bob's true willingness to purchase."
