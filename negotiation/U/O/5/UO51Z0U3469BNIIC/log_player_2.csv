"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am thrilled to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Bob wants to save as much as possible, and rejecting allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again.  While it's lower than John's price and a better offer than her previous one, there's still more room to negotiate. Bob's goal is to get the price as close to his $900,000 counteroffer as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to come up to $975,000, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 and significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a reasonable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price."
