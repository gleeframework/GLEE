Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to make Bob feel good about potentially buying the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Knowing my options:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **John is a backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of selling the product for too low a price.
* **Reiterate my value:** I'm mentioning that $125 is a ""fair price for both of us,"" subtly reminding Bob of the value of the product. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language like ""appreciate"" and ""fair"" to maintain a positive tone during the negotiation. 
* **Still aware of John:** I'm keeping John as a backup, and my counteroffer reflects that I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
