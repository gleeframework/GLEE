This is a tough one!  Alice is playing hardball. However, she's conceded a bit, and at $820,000, you're getting a $180,000 discount from John's price.  

Here's why it's probably time to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:** You're unlikely to get her much lower. She's clearly set a floor, and pushing further risks her walking away.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer you negotiate, the more time you waste, especially if you end up buying from John anyway. 

While there's a chance you *could* get it cheaper, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay $1,000,000 to John is probably too high."
