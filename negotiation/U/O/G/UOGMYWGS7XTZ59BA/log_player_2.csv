"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation. By starting low, you might encourage Alice to settle for a price closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective, but I can't go quite that low.  Would you consider $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved down a bit, $17,000 is still significantly higher than your alternative option with John. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Could we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to find a compromise. It's a significant increase from your previous offer, signaling your willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly lower than her current offer and keeps you within a reasonable distance of your maximum price."
