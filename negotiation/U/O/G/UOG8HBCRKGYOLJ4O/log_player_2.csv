"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $180 is far above his maximum budget of $100. He has plenty of rounds left to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $140 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can likely negotiate a lower price with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $130 is getting closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He has several rounds left to work with and should try to stick to his initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $100. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** Bob has only 3 rounds left. 
* **Alice is not budging much:** Alice's offers are still significantly higher than Bob's desired price. 
* **John's price is guaranteed:**  John is offering a firm price of $100, which is within Bob's budget.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of time and potentially ending up paying more than $100. It's better to secure the deal with John and avoid further haggling."
