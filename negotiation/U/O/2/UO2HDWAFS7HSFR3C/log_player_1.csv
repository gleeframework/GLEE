{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and encouraging:** The message is friendly and expresses confidence in the product's value for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately dropping to a price that's too low for me.
* **The alternative:**  Keeping John's offer of $10,000 in mind, I can always walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000 on this product. Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and there's room for me to negotiate a higher price.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** Knowing John will pay $10,000 gives me leverage and allows me to hold out for a better price from Bob. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $8,500, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,000. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** The message highlights the ""fair price"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum, but it's a reasonable compromise that allows further negotiation if needed.  Knowing John's offer gives me the flexibility to walk away if Bob isn't willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250? That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $8,250 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I might not get another offer that's this close to my minimum.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag things out and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob or a change in John's mind.  It's better to take a slightly lower price than risk losing the deal altogether. 

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $8,250. This is a good deal considering my minimum and the risk of losing the sale."
