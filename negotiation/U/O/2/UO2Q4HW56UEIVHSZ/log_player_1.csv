"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for both parties to build a positive negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Room for counteroffer:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, knowing we can negotiate further. 
* **Plan for John:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Time to counter:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but staying above Bob's offer.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a good deal compared to his estimated value of $8,000. 
* **Call to action:** I'm encouraging Bob to meet in the middle to close the deal.
* **Staying above minimum:** $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm  being cautious but also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and we are getting closer to a potential agreement.
* **Counteroffer is necessary:**  I need to counteroffer again to try to get a price closer to my target. 
* **John remains a backup:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit too low. Let's split the difference and settle at $8,250. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise further.
* **Emphasizing win-win:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to see the value in closing the deal.
* **Closing the gap:**  $8,250 is still above my minimum but significantly closer to Bob's offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 
* **Time pressure:**  While we have 10 rounds, I'm trying to close the deal sooner to avoid risks of further negotiations or Bob changing his mind."
