"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but $950,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $875,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to settle at $800,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to compromise, but $800,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,
