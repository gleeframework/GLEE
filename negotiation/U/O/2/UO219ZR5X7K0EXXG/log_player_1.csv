Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me. I'm aiming for a good profit, but also leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and adjust my price based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a good profit.  $16,000 is a fair compromise, and I think Bob might be willing to meet me there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear he's not going to meet me halfway. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation."
