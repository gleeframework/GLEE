Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that my initial price was a bit high for you.  However, $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $105 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $75? That feels like a fair price to me.

You have three options:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little bit.  How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob is now offering his maximum price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  There's little point in continuing the negotiation as it's unlikely Bob will go any higher. You're better off taking the guaranteed $120 from John."
