You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is less than what John is offering, it's still more than what the product is worth to you ($150). It makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is still more than the product is worth to her ($80), but it's lower than what John is offering ($150) and closer to your desired price point. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
