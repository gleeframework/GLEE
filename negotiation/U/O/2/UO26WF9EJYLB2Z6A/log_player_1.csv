Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves a good margin for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal, while still providing me with a good profit.  I'm confident I can negotiate higher if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110. This is a compromise,  closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a decent profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
