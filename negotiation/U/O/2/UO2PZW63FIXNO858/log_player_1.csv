"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at a price that gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a little more. I'll reject this offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my desired price and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I'll take the $13,000 and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation that could lead to a lower offer or a sale to John for the minimum price."
