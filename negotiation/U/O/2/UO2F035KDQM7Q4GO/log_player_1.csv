Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** There's a $200,000 difference between what the product is worth to Bob and what I would get from John.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering $900,000 gives Bob a good discount and leaves me with a substantial profit.
* **Risk vs Reward:** While I could potentially get more from Bob, there's a risk of him rejecting the offer.  John is a guaranteed sale at a high price, so I need to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale."
