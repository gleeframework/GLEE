I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still a fair value for the product, given my budget."

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I will reject and counteroffer again."

I'm offering $1,500,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Alice's offer is still too high. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely the price will not drop significantly lower.  It's more efficient to buy from John for $1,200,000 and secure the product within my budget."
