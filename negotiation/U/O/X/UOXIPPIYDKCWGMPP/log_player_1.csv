Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

```
Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $135 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to take a good deal now than risk losing him entirely.
