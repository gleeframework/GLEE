"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, I'm only willing to pay $75 for the product. If that works for you, let's make this happen. ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $82.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $82.50, but I think I can do a bit better. How about we go to $83? It's a small increase, but it's worth it for a great product like this.",83.0,Alice,5,
