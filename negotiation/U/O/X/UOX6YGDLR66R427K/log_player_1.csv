Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows us to both benefit from this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and any further negotiation significantly increases the risk of him walking away. Accepting his offer at $950,000 means losing out on a potential $50,000 profit. Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
