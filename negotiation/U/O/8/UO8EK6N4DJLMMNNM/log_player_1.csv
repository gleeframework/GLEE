Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, offering a slightly lower price to Bob has the potential to still earn more than my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $11,500 is a strong offer that's significantly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a quick sale.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays associated with finding another buyer, even if John is guaranteed.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
