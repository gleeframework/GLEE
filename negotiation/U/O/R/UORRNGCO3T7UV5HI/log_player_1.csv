While I could push for a higher price, Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground. Accepting his offer of $855,000 is a significant profit, and the risk of him walking away increases if I continue to negotiate. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to settle for John's $800,000."
