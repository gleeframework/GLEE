"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $110. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $100 to me. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about $95?  It's still a fair deal for both of us, and it's closer to my bottom line. Let's find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the most I can afford right now.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $85 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's the best I can do, and it's a price that's fair to us both.  Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
