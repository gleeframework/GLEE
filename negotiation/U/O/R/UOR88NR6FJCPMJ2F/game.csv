"Dear Bob,

I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and efficiency of your operations. Given its unique features and benefits, we estimate its true worth to be $1,200,000 to us. However, recognizing the importance of negotiation and mutual benefit, I am extending a special offer to you.

For a limited time only, I am willing to consider selling this product to you for $950,000. This represents a significant saving of $250,000 compared to our standard valuation, while still ensuring a substantial return on investment for us.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. I am confident that this product will meet and exceed your expectations, providing long-term benefits to your business.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice",950000.0,Alice,1,
