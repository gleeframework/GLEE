"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate you reaching out.  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  Would you be willing to do $110?  That's the most I can afford right now.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $125?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $127. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",127.0,Alice,5,
