{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Return:** $1,975,000 is a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal. 
* **Time Value:** We're past the halfway point in negotiations. Holding out for a small increase isn't worth the risk of Bob walking away."
