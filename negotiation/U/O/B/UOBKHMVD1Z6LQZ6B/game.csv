"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $125?  I'm really close to my limit, but I think this is a fair compromise.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $128? It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",128.0,Alice,5,
