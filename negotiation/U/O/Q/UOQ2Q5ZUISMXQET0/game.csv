"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in this product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to consider $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $92.50",92.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92.50 is still a little out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $90.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
