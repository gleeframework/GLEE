"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $875,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
