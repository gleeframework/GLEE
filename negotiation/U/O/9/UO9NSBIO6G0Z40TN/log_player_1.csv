{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. I'm willing to drop the price a bit if necessary, but I won't go below $150, as that's my minimum acceptable price. I'll also be monitoring how the negotiation unfolds and how Bob responds to determine my next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $100. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'll try to negotiate a little higher, but if things don't work out, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $150."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 105}
