"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $100. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome.",105.0,Alice,5,
