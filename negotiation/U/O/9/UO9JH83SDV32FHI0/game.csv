"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $100 to make it worth my while. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. How about we compromise at $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be overpaying for this product. I'm willing to make one last offer: $98. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. I really like the product, but I need to be smart about my budget.",98.0,Bob,6,
