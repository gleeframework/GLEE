"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a high price to maximize my potential profit, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Open-ended question:**  I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer is still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John right now would mean a loss compared to my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of this product to you. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but not going below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob again, hoping to encourage him to see the value in the price.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, so I'll offer $875000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited rounds:**  We are already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating.
* **Potential loss:**  If I keep rejecting offers and run out of rounds, I might be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a better deal than selling to John."
