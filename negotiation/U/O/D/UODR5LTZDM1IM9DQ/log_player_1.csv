Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,450,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making the price more palatable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers, encouraging Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This price would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding out for More:** While $1,300,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I believe I can get a higher offer from Bob, especially since he acknowledges the product's value and is motivated to buy.  
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John would be a guaranteed $1,200,000, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob for a potentially higher payout."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not going any lower.  This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a reasonable concession by lowering my price from $1,450,000 to $1,350,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and suggests a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential gain he'll receive from the purchase.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, adding some urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,325,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  Let's try to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $1,325,000 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Pushing for a Better Deal:** I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can secure a price closer to my target of $1,450,000.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  Selling to John would guarantee a decent profit, but I'm hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm only willing to go as low as $1,335,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my willingness to negotiate. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1335000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, dropping my offer from $1,350,000 to $1,335,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still want to get a price closer to my target.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness, suggesting that this price is a reasonable compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that I'm ready to close the deal, adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
