**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly very firm on her price, and we're getting dangerously close to John's offer.  Continuing the negotiation has a very low chance of saving us a significant amount of money, and it risks us ending up with no deal at all. Buying from John guarantees we get the product and stay within our budget."
