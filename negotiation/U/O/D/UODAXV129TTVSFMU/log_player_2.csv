"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth more to Alice than to Bob, so Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  It's too early to buy from John because there's room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high for Bob's budget. He's still willing to negotiate, and should continue to try to lower the price. It's too early to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $140 at this point. If we can meet in the middle, I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $152.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's $100 limit. At this point, Bob should cut his losses and buy from John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get the price down significantly enough to make it worthwhile."
