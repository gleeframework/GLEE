"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's more than the product's worth to you and you can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still above her value for the product. This shows I'm serious about buying, but also willing to negotiate.
* **Fairness:**  My offer is closer to the midpoint between Alice's value and my own.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Alice to counter, so we can work towards a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $1,075,000 is still too high.  I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit while ensuring a quick and efficient transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm sticking to my position of wanting a price closer to $950,000.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly higher price than my last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Efficiency:** Highlighting a quick deal can be appealing to Alice, as it avoids further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal on a product worth significantly more to you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, and $1,050,000 is within a reasonable range for me.  At this point, I don't want to risk further negotiation. 

* **Potential for Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** I've already gone through several rounds, and buying from Alice at this price saves time and effort. 

While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the potential risks outweigh the possible gains."
