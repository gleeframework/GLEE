"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to make a profit while ensuring you get a valuable product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's try $1,000,000. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable profit while ensuring a quick and efficient transaction. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal on a product worth significantly more to you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
