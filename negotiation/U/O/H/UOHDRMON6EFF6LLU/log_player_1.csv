Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. After considering the value of the product, I'm willing to sell it to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $900,000}

This is a competitive price, considering the product's value, and I'm hoping Bob will find it reasonable. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, but it's still a significant amount. Since I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $800,000, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer. I'll sell the product to Bob for $800,000.
