"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save even more. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product. This price still allows you to make a profit while giving me a significant saving. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1350000? It's a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to achieve a decent profit while still giving you a substantial discount. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
