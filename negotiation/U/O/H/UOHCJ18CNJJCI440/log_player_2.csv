"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This price represents a fair value for both of us, allowing me to achieve a profit while still offering you a considerable saving. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1350000? It's a good compromise for both of us, allowing me to achieve a decent profit while still giving you a substantial discount. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive:** $1,350,000 is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than his maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  Bob has already rejected Alice's initial offer and made a counteroffer. It's possible Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, or even decide to sell to someone else. 
* **The risk of going to John is high:**  Buying from John would cost Bob a significant amount more ($1,500,000 vs. $1,350,000). 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
