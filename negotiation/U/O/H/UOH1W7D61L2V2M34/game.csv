"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. This price is still a good deal for me and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
