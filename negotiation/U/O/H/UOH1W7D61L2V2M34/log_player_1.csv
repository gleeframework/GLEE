Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $12500. I believe this is a fair price considering it's worth $12000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's a good price, I can still potentially get more from Bob in the next rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still gives you a great deal and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. This price is still a good deal for me and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I will accept Bob's offer. While I could potentially get a little more, there is a risk that we will not be able to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds and I would have to sell to John for a lower price. $13,000 is a good price that is close to my desired value and ensures a quick sale."
