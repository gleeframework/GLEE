Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll agree. I'm willing to part with it for $2,000,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product holds significant value for both you and Bob, starting with a price higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $2,000,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in Bob's interest, aiming to encourage acceptance. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject a price perceived as too high. However, this strategy balances that risk with the potential for a much higher payout than selling directly to John."
