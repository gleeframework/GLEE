"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest. While $12500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be well worth it. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12800?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",12800.0,Bob,4,
