"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept the offer at the starting price.  Since your goal is to save money, it's best to try and negotiate with Alice first.  We can explore if she's willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer (50% lower than Alice's initial price) is a strong tactic.  It establishes your intent to negotiate aggressively and see if Alice is willing to play ball.  This is also a reasonable starting point considering your maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'd like to pay. I'll continue to try and negotiate a better price.  It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and I have several rounds left to explore that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also demonstrates I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. It's a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, she'll be more receptive to this offer."
