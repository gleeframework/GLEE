"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,100,000? This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise and hopefully, we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
