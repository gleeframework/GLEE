"Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. Let's split the difference - how about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know your thoughts.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $16,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable going down to $13,500.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $15,000? That's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm still not comfortable going lower than $15,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm not sure why you're so hesitant.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",15000.0,Alice,7,
