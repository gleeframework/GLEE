"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer, as I want to maximize my profit. However, I'm keeping it within a reasonable range that Bob might consider, considering the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $150, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit more to see if we can find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $150 I can get from John.  I'll reject this offer and see if we can reach a deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $145? It's a fair price, and we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm making a small concession here, but I'm still above my minimum price of $150. I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about $135? That's the lowest I can go, but I really think this product would be a great fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting close to my minimum price. It's not worth the risk of losing him as a buyer and potentially needing to start the negotiation process again with someone else. 

John is a sure thing for $150, which is above my minimum. Selling to John guarantees a secure profit, and it's better than the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
