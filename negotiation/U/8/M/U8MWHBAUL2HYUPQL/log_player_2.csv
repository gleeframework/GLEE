"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $10,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This tactic establishes our position and leaves room for negotiation.  We don't want to go too low and risk offending Alice, but this offer signals that we're serious about buying but looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to our desired price, but we're still above John's offer.  We need to push a little harder to see if we can get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",

}
```

We're inching closer to Alice's likely bottom line while still leaving room for a final compromise.  Expressing appreciation for the negotiation process can help maintain a positive relationship and potentially lead to a better outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer at $8,000. I'm willing to let it go for $8,200 to you, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but strategically it makes sense to accept.  Alice has revealed her bottom line and introduced competition. While we could push for $8,000, there's a real chance she'll walk away, forcing us to buy from John anyway. Accepting a slightly higher price ($8,200) guarantees we get the product and saves us the risk of losing it altogether."
