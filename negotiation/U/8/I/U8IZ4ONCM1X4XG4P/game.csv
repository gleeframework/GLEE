"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $5,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground here.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500.  Would that be feasible?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution we're both comfortable with.",8000.0,Alice,5,
