"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $12,500.  That's a fair compromise and gives me room to work with. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
