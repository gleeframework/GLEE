It's better to see if you can get a lower price from Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a lower offer of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and hopefully, it will encourage her to negotiate further."

$11,000 is still too high,  but it's closer to my target. I'll counter offer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
