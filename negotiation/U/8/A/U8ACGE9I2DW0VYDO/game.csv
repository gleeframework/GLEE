,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I can go up to $95. Let's meet in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we do $105?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to be reasonable here. $105 is still a bit too much.  How about we split the difference and do $100? That way we both walk away happy.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I can do $110 again, but that's as high as I'll go. Take it or leave it?",110.0,Alice,7,
