"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks great, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted rate.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,750? I'm eager to make this work.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go much lower. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great compromise considering the value this product will bring to your business.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,550 is still a bit too high for me. To be honest, I'm getting close to my limit. I can offer $10,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,
