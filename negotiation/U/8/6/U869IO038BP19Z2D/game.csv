"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for it.  This reflects the value it holds for me and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you and the value I'm placing on it.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there. How about $725,000?  It's a solid price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $775,000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $762,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",762500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $762,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $740,000? This is a fair offer that reflects the value I'm placing on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's make this happen!",740000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to reach an agreement on this. I'm willing to go to $745,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to consider other options.",745000.0,Bob,8,
