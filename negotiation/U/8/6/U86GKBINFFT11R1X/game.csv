"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1200000, but I'm willing to go up to $1250000 if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I'm not sure I can stretch any further. Can you consider meeting me at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1200000. Considering you're willing to go up to $1150000, I'm willing to meet you at $1225000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to keep the deal moving forward.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to see some movement from you. I'll meet you at $1200000, but I'm not going any lower. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm willing to consider it.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need you to meet me halfway from your last offer.
