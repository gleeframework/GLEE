Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting her offer.

**The Sweet Spot:** Alice needs to find a price that's significantly appealing to Bob (much higher than his perceived value of $1,000,000) while still maximizing her own profit.

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I want to make this a win-win. I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, suggesting Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly.
* **High but Negotiable:** Offering it at $1,400,000 leaves room for some negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing a substantial profit for Alice.
* **Win-Win Framing:** The message frames the deal as mutually beneficial, emphasizing that Alice is willing to make a deal.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, or he might be willing to walk away. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has the security of selling to John for her minimum desired price."
