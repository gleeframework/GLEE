"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to pay that much for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10500? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more than my minimum. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm still not comfortable with $9200, I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we settle on $9800? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",9800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9800. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9300. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",9300.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $9600 to make this happen.  It's a significant concession from my end, but I really want to make this deal work. Let me know if you're on board.",9600.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9600. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9200. I think this is the lowest I can go, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.",9200.0,Bob,8,
