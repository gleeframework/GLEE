"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can meet you at $13,000, but I'm willing to go up to $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $10,000, and it's still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to Bob. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and minimizes the risk of further negotiations."
