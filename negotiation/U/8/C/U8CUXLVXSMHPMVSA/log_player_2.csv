"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. I'm asking for $10000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in trying to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget.  $8000 is a little lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference at $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $9,000, which is still within your budget and a good compromise considering her initial offer was $10,000. It's a fair price to both of you, so accepting the offer is the best option. You get a slight discount, and Alice doesn't have to lower her price too much."
