"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering its true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering its true value to me is $800000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
