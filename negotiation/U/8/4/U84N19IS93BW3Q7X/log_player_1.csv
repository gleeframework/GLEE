Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value to see if Bob is interested.  I'll be ready to negotiate down if he's not willing to pay this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is a decent offer, I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $97.50? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the suggestion, but I would like to propose $95 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really enjoying our negotiation! I'm still willing to work with you. How about we settle on $96? It's a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 96} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad you're willing to compromise. Let's try $94 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get closer to my minimum value, the negotiation with Bob has gone on for a while and I'm concerned we might not reach an agreement.  John is offering a guaranteed price of $100, which is my minimum, so I'm going to take that deal."
