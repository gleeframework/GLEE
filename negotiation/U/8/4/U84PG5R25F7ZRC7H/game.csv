"Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market worth. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure if $20,000 is a fair price for me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $20,000 is already a competitive offer.  I could meet you halfway at $16,000. This offer stands as a compromise that reflects the product's worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I still think $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $14,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we meet in the middle again?",14000.0,Bob,4,
