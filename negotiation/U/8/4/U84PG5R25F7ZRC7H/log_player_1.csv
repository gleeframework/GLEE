Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I still think $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $14,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Can we meet in the middle again?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

While negotiating with Bob might lead to a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear that we're unlikely to reach a deal significantly above John's offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
