Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I was hoping we could come to an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. I'll counter his offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offering."

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather secure the sale now than risk losing the deal entirely with further negotiations."
