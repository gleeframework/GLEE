Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time"") and positions it as a small ""loss"" for you while still being a potential ""gain"" for Bob.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for your minimum acceptable price."
