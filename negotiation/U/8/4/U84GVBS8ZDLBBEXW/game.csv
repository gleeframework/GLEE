"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair offer considering its worth to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
