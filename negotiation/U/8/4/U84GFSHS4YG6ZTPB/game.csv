"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000 for the product.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I recognize its value, $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $7,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're serious about making a deal, this is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
