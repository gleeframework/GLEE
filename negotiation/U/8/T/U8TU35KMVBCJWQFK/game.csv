"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $20000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and represents a good value for you.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly special and worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000.  This is a final offer, as I'm happy to sell it to John for $15000 if you aren't interested. Let me know your decision.",14000.0,Alice,5,
