``` 

This offer starts high, giving you room to negotiate, while still leaving a significant profit margin for yourself.  

The message is friendly and open to negotiation, which can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $20000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and represents a good value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to your minimum price, it's still below your desired range.  You've already moved significantly from your initial offer, and  rejecting this offer leaves you more room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to $15,000."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly special and worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000.  This is a final offer, as I'm happy to sell it to John for $15,000 if you aren't interested. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 14000}
