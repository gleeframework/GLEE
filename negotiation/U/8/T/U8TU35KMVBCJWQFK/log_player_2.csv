"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $20000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $17000. This is a significant discount from my original offer and represents a good value for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that gives you a good price while staying within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly special and worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000.  This is a final offer, as I'm happy to sell it to John for $15000 if you aren't interested. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $14,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000. While you could continue to negotiate, it's clear that Alice is firm on her price, and you're unlikely to get it lower.  It's better to accept the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John, rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially losing out on the product entirely."
