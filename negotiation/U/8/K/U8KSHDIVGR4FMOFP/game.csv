,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $11,200, Bob. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to think about my minimum price. How about $11,700?",11700.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,200. I'm really close to walking away from this deal. I think we're at a stalemate. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $8,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",11200.0,Bob,10,
