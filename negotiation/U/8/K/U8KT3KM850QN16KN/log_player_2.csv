"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's a discount, it's still above your maximum value of $100.
* **Negotiation is worth trying:**  You can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **John is a fallback option:**  If negotiation with Alice fails, you can still buy the product from John."
