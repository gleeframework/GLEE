Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 (Bob's max) and $1,499,999 (just below your guaranteed price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's as close to Bob's maximum value as possible without going below your minimum.  A single take-it-or-leave-it offer can be risky, so it's often better to leave some room for negotiation.

**Offer**

Here's a possible offer you, as Alice, could send to Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Starting Point:** This starts the negotiation significantly above Bob's value but still leaves room for him to counter-offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests flexibility and a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this initial offer. Be prepared for him to counter-offer, and have a strategy in mind for how low you're willing to go before accepting John's offer."
