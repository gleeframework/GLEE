"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $15000. Considering its high quality and the benefits it brings, I believe this is an exceptional opportunity for you. I am offering it to you today at a special introductory price of $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to negotiate further. How about considering the product at a price of $13500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $13,500 is significantly better than the original $14,000 and much closer to Bob's target of $13,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** While Bob could try to push for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  She might reject the counteroffer, and the price could increase in subsequent rounds.
* **Time constraint:** With only 10 rounds, pushing for a lower price could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.

Accepting the offer at $13,500 is the best option in this round, balancing the need for a good price with the risk of further negotiation."
