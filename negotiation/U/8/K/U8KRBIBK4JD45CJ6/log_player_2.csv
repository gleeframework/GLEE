"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be of great value to you. My asking price is $1,750,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run. Please consider this offer carefully, as I'm also in discussions with another buyer who is very interested.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. You're much better off going with John's offer, even if it means potentially missing out on whatever benefits Alice is highlighting."
