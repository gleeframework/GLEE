"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning:  While Bob would prefer a lower price, $105 is still a good deal compared to John's $120 price. It's a reasonable compromise, and Bob is likely to get a good deal on the product."
