"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110, knowing it's likely Bob will reject this offer. This gives me room to negotiate down while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price to $105, still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and signals I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $92. While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I'm not confident I'll get a better offer in the next round. Additionally, with John as a backup option, I'm comfortable closing the deal here."
