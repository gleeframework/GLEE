"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $900,000 is significantly more than Alice's value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Better deal possible:** You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000, so you have leverage to try and get a better price from Alice.
* **Multiple rounds:** With 10 rounds, you have time to explore negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint approach:** This offer is right in the middle of Alice's value ($800,000) and your target price ($900,000). It's a fair starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By not offering the absolute minimum, you create space for Alice to counter-offer if she needs to.
* **Staying within your budget:** This offer is still comfortably within your $1,200,000 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is worse than before:**  $950,000 is actually higher than her first offer ($900,000), making it less appealing.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Even though Alice rejected your offer, it shows she's willing to negotiate. You still have 7 rounds to explore a better price.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:**  Accepting this offer would leave you with less room for profit and increase the risk of going over your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's value:** This offer is slightly higher than your previous offer but still leaves some room for Alice to counter-offer without going over her desired price.
* **Showing commitment to negotiation:** By making a counteroffer, you demonstrate that you're serious about buying the product and are willing to compromise.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:** Staying at your previous offer could lead to a deadlock.  Increasing the price slightly shows a willingness to move forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:** This offer is even higher than her previous offer, showing a lack of flexibility.
* **Time pressure is building:** We are now in the middle of the negotiation process, and the pressure to reach a deal is increasing. However, rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open.
* **John is still an option:** You can still buy the product from John for a higher price, giving you a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

It's important to try and reach a deal with Alice, but you need to be firm in your stance. You should try to send a counteroffer that is closer to your desired price, but also recognize that Alice may be unwilling to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This offer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still being within your budget.
* **Final Offer Stance:**  By phrasing this as a counteroffer, you are signalling that you are close to your limit, putting pressure on Alice to respond.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are approaching the halfway point in negotiations.  This offer allows you to gauge Alice's willingness to move before considering John.

**Next Steps:**

It's important to analyze Alice's response to this offer. If she rejects it, you may need to reconsider your strategy and potentially explore buying from John as a backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is unacceptable:** Alice's offer keeps escalating, exceeding your desired price and showing a lack of flexibility.  
* **Negotiation is at an impasse:**  We're in the middle of the negotiation and her offer is still far from your target. It's unlikely Alice will budge further. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only three rounds left, you are risking running out of time and still not securing a good deal.
* **John offers a safety net:**  John provides a guaranteed purchase option for $1,200,000, which is still within your budget.

**Conclusion:**

While you were hoping to secure a better price with Alice, it's becoming evident that a deal within your desired range is unlikely.  Therefore, buying from John is the most logical option to ensure you acquire the product without exceeding your budget."
