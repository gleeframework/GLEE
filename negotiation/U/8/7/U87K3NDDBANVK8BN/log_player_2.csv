"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. It's a significant discount from what I would normally sell it for, and it's a price that I'm confident is fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'll choose option 2, I'll reject Alice's offer. If I buy the product from Alice for $14,000, I'll be paying $2,000 more than I need to. I'll wait for John's offer.
