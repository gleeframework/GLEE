"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-time opportunity to get it at a price that's lower than its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to buy directly from John and save the money."
