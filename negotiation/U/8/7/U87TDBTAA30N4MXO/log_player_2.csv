You should reject Alice's offer and counteroffer.  $950,000 is still too high for you, and you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal considering its worth to you. This is my final offer before I pursue other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can try to push for a lower price, and if Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from John."
