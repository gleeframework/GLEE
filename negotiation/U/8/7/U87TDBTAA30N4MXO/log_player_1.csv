Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as fair, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open-ended:** I'm leaving room for Bob to respond, making the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step in the right direction, $850,000 is still far below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he acknowledges the product's value to him.
* **John as Leverage:**  The fact that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is significantly below the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal considering its worth to you. This is my final offer before I pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $950,000 to $900,000.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards acceptance.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.
* **Other Options:**  I'm subtly referencing John as a backup to maintain pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $900,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs, and I believe it's a good compromise for us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're at a stalemate.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is more than I'd get from Bob's current offer.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a higher price. Selling to John eliminates the risk of a lower offer or a failed negotiation.

It's time to take the guaranteed deal and move on."
