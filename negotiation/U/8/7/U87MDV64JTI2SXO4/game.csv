"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $8,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is unfortunately still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the lowest I can go.",8000.0,Alice,5,
