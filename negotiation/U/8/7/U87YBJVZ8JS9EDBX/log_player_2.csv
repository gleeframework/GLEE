"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe holds immense value for you, just like it does for me. This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and my offer to you is to purchase it at a special introductory price of $950,000. This represents an exclusive opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a discounted rate.

I understand that such a significant investment might require careful consideration. To ease your decision-making process, please note that if you decide not to proceed with this offer, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product at its full value of $1,000,000. However, I hope that by offering this special price, we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you have any questions about the product. I am here to provide you with all the information you need to make an informed decision.

Best regards,
Alice
