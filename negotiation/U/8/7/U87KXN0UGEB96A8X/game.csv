"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at 115? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 110 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach an agreement. How about we meet at 112? It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let's shake hands!",112.0,Alice,5,
