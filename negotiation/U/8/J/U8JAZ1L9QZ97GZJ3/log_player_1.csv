Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  I'm starting high ($950,000) to leave room for negotiation. This price is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it's still slightly less than my guaranteed offer from John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By phrasing the offer as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" I'm subtly implying that if Bob declines, he might miss out. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. My ultimate goal is to secure the highest possible price, even if it means eventually accepting a price closer to his perceived value."
