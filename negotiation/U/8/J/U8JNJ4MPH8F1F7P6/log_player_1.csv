Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider the product, but $1500000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for a product like this. Can you meet me in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $1,350,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything significantly less than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,400,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is reasonable and within a range I'm comfortable with.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000 and I'm confident I can't get a better price with the remaining rounds."
