Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me to accept.  While I understand your position, this product holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still above your target price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a lower price."
