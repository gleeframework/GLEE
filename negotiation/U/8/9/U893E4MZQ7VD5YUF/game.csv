"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I believe this reflects a fair price considering the value it brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
