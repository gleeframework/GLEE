""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a win-win situation:
    * Bob gets the product for $400,000 less than its worth to him.
    * You gain an additional $400,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning a ""strong offer lined up"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale, leveraging Bob's perceived value of the product."
