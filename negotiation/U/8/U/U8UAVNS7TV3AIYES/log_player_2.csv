Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above your ideal price. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my budget.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my preferred price point. I'll continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to my $10,500 counteroffer. There's still a good chance I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  This price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,750. This is a compromise that I hope we can both be satisfied with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,750, which is only $750 more than my preferred price of $10,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation. It's important to consider that I've already invested some time in this negotiation and might not get a better deal with John, considering his price is fixed."
