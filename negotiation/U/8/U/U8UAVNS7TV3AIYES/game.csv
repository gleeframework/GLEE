"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging my budget.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to consider a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  This price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,750. This is a compromise that I hope we can both be satisfied with.",10750.0,Alice,5,
