"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but leaves room for negotiation.  This initial offer is aimed at starting the conversation and exploring if there's potential for a deal.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $105 is a good offer, I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $110, which is still above my minimum of $120, but it's a step closer to Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $107.50 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $107.50 is a good offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $108.75. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```

I'm offering $108.75, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise, hopefully leading to a successful deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $108.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $106.25, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $106.25 is still below my minimum price of $120, and we're approaching the end of the negotiation rounds. At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John for $120, as it guarantees me my desired profit."
