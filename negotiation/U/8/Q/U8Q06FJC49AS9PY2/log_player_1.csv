Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he rejects, I'll need to gauge his interest level and decide whether to counteroffer or move on to John.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  If Bob counteroffers, I'll use his offer to assess his perceived value of the product and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. My goal will be to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open.
* **Selling to John:**  If the negotiation with Bob stalls or I don't believe I can get a higher price, I'll sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $8,000 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  
* **No room for improvement:** There's no realistic expectation that I can get a higher price in further negotiations.  
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting and counteroffering could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away, potentially leaving me with no sale.

**By accepting, I ensure a quick and profitable sale.**"
