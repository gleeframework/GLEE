"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Considering we're already at $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
