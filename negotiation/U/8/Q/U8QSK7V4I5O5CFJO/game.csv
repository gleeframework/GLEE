"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would significantly benefit your business. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,350,000.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential and benefits this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your desire to meet halfway, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $1,125,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end while hopefully still fitting within your budget.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1,050,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
