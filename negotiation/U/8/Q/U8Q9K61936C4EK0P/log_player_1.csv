Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Starting at $150 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob doesn't accept $150, this initial offer opens the door for negotiation. You can always lower the price slightly if he rejects the first offer, but you can't raise it."
