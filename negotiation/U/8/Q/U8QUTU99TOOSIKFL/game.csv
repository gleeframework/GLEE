"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and bring the price down to $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,200,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is significant. I can come down slightly to $1,175,000, but that's my best offer.  This is a fair price considering the return you'll see on your investment.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
