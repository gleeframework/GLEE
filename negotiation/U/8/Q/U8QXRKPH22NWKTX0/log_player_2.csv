{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $10,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
* **Strategy:**  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  
* I'm hoping this will incentivize Alice to negotiate further.
* I'm leaving room for potential compromise in the next rounds."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still get the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $9,500 is a good price, significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to my ideal price.
* **Strategy:** Accepting this offer means I've saved $500 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice walking away or getting a worse deal with John outweighs the potential savings."
