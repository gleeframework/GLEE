"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering your value is $10,000, and it saves me some money.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",11000.0,Alice,3,
