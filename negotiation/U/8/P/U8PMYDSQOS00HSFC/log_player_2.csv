"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is still a great deal for you, considering your value is $10,000, and it saves me some money.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a decent saving for Bob compared to John's price of $12,000.  Further negotiation may result in a slightly lower price, but it's likely to take more time and effort, potentially leading to a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without unnecessary risk or delay."
