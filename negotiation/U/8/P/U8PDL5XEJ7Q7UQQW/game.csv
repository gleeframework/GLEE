"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I'm confident in the value this product brings, and I can't go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a win-win for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,800 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $10,200?  I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the value you'll receive.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $10,200 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,900? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9900.0,Bob,6,
