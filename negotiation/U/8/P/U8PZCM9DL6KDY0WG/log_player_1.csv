"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer yet. It's still lower than my minimum, and I think I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with him.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet at $9,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow you to still get a good deal on the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8750? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price with a few more rounds of negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. However, $8,750 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $9,250 as a final compromise. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about buying it, I urge you to reconsider my offer."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $9250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $9000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a good deal than hold out for a perfect one and potentially lose out."
