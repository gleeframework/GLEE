"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, however.  How about $1,600,000? This price is still fair given the value of the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
