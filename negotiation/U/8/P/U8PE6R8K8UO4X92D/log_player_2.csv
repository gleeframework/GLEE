"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find this price fair. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense for Bob to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $10,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $10,500. Bob has the option of continuing to negotiate or buying from John for $10,000. Since John is willing to sell for the same price as Alice's latest counteroffer, it makes sense for Bob to buy from John.  There's no guarantee that Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the product to another buyer."
