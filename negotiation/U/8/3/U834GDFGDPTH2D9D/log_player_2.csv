"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has great value and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. 
* Buying from John right now is not the optimal choice as you could potentially get a better price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000 and closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,050,000.
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to further rounds, potentially increasing the price or taking too much time.
* Buying from John for $1,500,000 is not a better option at this point, as Alice's offer is significantly lower."
