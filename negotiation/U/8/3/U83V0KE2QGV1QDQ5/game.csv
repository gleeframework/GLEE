"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $700000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement and make this deal happen.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $650000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget while still respecting the value you see in it.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $650000. Considering the product's true value to you is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $725000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still seeking a more favorable price. After further reflection, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $675000 for the product. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial agreement.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $675000. Considering the product's true value to you is $800000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $720000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?",720000.0,Alice,5,

"I've considered your last offer, Alice, and while I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still not able to meet you at $720000. After careful thought, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $690000 for the product. I hope this proposal will help us reach a satisfactory conclusion.",690000.0,Bob,6,
