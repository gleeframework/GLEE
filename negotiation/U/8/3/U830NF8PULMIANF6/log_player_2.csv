"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so he's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's perceived value. This gives Bob a strong starting point for negotiation while leaving room for potential concessions in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially secure a better deal.  The risk of losing the deal to John is still present, but Bob has 7 rounds left to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that he's willing to negotiate but still values a lower price.  The offer is still below Alice's last offer, showing that Bob is willing to compromise but also hoping for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer, and it's getting closer to Bob's desired price range.  Continuing to reject and counteroffer carries the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's considerably lower than John's, saving him a significant amount of money."
