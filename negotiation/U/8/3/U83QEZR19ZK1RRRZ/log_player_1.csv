"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This allows for room to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with the price.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but staying above Bob's offer. I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm confident that we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept his offer. I believe we can reach a higher price with more negotiation.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'm confident we can reach a compromise that is fair to both of us.  The deal with John is always an option, but I'm still hoping to close this deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is getting close to Bob's valuation of the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can push for a higher price.  I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach a middle ground.  I've lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept the deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. I've negotiated as much as I can, and his offers are still far below my minimum.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
