"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that $8,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's the price I was originally thinking of.",10000.0,Alice,5,
