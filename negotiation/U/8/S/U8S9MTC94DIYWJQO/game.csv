"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit higher than you were hoping to pay. However, I'm still a bit above the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still a bit below my target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement here.",825000.0,Alice,5,
