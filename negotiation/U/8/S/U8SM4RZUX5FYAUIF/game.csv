"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $12000. How about we meet at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I'm still interested in the product, but $13500 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to meet you at $12500. Can you consider that?",12500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $14000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $11500. If not, I'll be forced to consider buying from John.",11500.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand your frustration, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to give me one more chance. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $14000, which is $12725. I hope this is a price we can both agree on.",12725.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $12725. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to walk away and buy from John.",12000.0,Bob,8,,
