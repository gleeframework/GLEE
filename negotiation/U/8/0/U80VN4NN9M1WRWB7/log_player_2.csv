"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** While $120 is less than your maximum, it's still a significant amount of money.
* **There's room for negotiation.** You know the product is worth $80 to Alice, so there's a potential for a much better deal.
* **Rejecting the offer gives you leverage.**  By rejecting, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price and encourage Alice to make a more attractive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows you're serious about buying but also willing to push for a better deal.
* **Focuses on value:** The message emphasizes your interest in the product and frames the price as a fair reflection of its value to you.
* **Sets the stage for continued negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer, you keep the negotiation alive and give Alice a chance to respond."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and I let it go for $110?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, you can still potentially get a better price.
* **You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate.** By rejecting her previous offer, you've shown that you're not afraid to walk away.
* **Time is on your side.** You have 7 rounds left, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. Continuing to negotiate could lead to a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:**  Offering $105 is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you're serious about buying but not rushing to accept.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** The message highlights a ""fair compromise,"" making it seem like you're finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Urgency without pressure:**  The ""let's make this deal happen"" line adds a slight sense of urgency without putting too much pressure on Alice."
