"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is too low.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $95, but I can't go any higher than that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $95 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference at $105. This would give you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. It's a fair price, and I need to stick to my budget.",100.0,Bob,6,
