"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the potential return on investment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering both our perspectives.  Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $1,400,000. This is a significant move from my last offer and demonstrates my sincere desire to reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
