,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $130 for the product, given its value to me. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $165 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm only willing to pay $145. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $155, but I'm still a little hesitant. I'm happy to pay $150. This is a good compromise, and it would allow you to make a fair profit while staying within my budget. What do you say?",150.0,Bob,6,
