"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 200} 
 
I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll have a better idea of his range and can adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$50 is far too low for me.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm still hoping to get a decent price from Bob, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $150 if negotiations break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it well above my minimum.  I'm hoping this is more attractive to Bob, but I'm ready to move on if he rejects again."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject and counter again. I'm hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}

I'm getting closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping that by offering a lower price, I can get Bob to agree. However, I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects."

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer just above my minimum.  If Bob rejects, I'm going to sell to John."
