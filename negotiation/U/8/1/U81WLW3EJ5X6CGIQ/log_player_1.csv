"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired $1,150,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving in too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer, or even a deal falling through.  Accepting $1,100,000 is a good outcome, and it's a safer bet than risking losing the deal entirely."
