# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice is not budging on her price, and $10,500 is still too high for Bob. It's best to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
