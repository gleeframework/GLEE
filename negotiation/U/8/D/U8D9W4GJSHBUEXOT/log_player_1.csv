Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This would give you a good profit while still being within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.
