{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident Bob will see the value in the product and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still lower than my preferred range. I believe there's more room for negotiation and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value I seek from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I ideally want, it's a reasonable compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price and closer to my desired price than what John is offering.  I'll accept this offer to close the deal and avoid further negotiations."
