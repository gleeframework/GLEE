"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique and exclusive item that I'm sure you'll find very appealing. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit above your budget, but $700,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I'm afraid I'm just not comfortable going that high.  My absolute best offer is $850,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I can offer you a 5% discount from my previous offer, which brings the price down to $855,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",855000.0,Alice,7,
