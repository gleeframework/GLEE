"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and understanding the value of this product. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still far beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I want to be transparent. I've received a compelling offer for this product from another buyer at a much higher price. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to acquire it. I'm willing to let go of it for $1,800,000, but this is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider the other offer on the table.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have another offer, but I'm still only comfortable with $800,000. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
