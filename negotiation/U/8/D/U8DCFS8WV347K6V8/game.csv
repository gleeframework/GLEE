"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get at least $1,500,000 for it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand this product holds significant value, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This feels like a fair price considering my budget. What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
