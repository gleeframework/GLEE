Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'm confident that I can get at least $1,000,000 from John if negotiations with Bob fail, so there's no risk of losing out.  We'll see if Bob is interested in making a deal at this price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my floor price, I'm not willing to accept it immediately.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  This should encourage Bob to come up a bit from his offer, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and while it's still less than I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
