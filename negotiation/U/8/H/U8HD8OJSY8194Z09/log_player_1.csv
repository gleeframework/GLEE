Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a price that is above my minimum value for the product but still potentially appealing to Bob as it's below his perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's closer to my initial offer than my own minimum.  Accepting his offer is the best option for maximizing my profit in this round."
