"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $95. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",95.0,Alice,5,
