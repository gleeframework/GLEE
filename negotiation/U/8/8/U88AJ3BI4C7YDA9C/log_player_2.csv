"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000.  I know it's a valuable asset for you, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for the same price Alice is offering, there is no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting the offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller with a better deal."
