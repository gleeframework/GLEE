Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, recognizing its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I can come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more in further rounds, Bob reaching $1,500,000 matches what John is offering. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation falling through, leaving me to take the guaranteed $1,500,000."
