Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for Counteroffers:**  $12,000 gives Bob some room to counteroffer without me having to immediately accept a deal that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Time Constraint:**  Mentioning the other buyer (John) subtly implies that I'm not desperate for a sale and have other options.  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I am willing to pay $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I can likely get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and countering. 
* **Time Constraint:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit, there's a chance I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Move:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards My Minimum:**  $11,500 is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and is closer to my desired minimum.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language like ""good deal"" to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Adding a Touch of Pressure:**  Implying that I'm not willing to go much lower creates a sense of urgency for Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try to negotiate a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and saves time compared to further negotiation.

**Next Move:** I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him for $11,000."
