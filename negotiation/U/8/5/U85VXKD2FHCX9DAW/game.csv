"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its potential. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,000,000.  This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and the long-term value it will bring to your operations.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a bit more within my budget. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is truly exceptional and I believe my initial offer accurately reflects that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,950,000. This is my best offer and represents a significant investment in your future success.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the price you're willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  I've tried to be flexible, but to be completely transparent, $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and bring the price down to $1,850,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a very fair offer considering the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
