""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its potential. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $2,000,000.  This takes into account the unique benefits it offers and the long-term value it will bring to your operations.  What are your thoughts?"",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's a bit more within my budget. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however, the value of this product is truly exceptional and I believe my initial offer accurately reflects that.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,950,000. This is my best offer and represents a significant investment in your future success."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the price you're willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a couple more rounds to see if I can bring him closer to $1,800,000.  However, if he doesn't move considerably in the next round, I will sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation.  I've tried to be flexible, but to be completely transparent, $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. I'm willing to make one final concession and bring the price down to $1,850,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a very fair offer considering the significant value this product will bring to your business.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $1,850,000 is still a bit above my budget.

I believe this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and the price you're willing to accept. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to move forward with the purchase.

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now only $50,000 away from my preferred price of $1,800,000. While I stated my last offer was final, accepting at $1,750,000 is still a significant profit, and further negotiation isn't worth the risk of losing the sale entirely."
