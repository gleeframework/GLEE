"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
