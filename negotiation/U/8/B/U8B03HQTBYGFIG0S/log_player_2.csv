"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit above your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to your ideal price.  Accepting this offer saves you money compared to buying from John."
