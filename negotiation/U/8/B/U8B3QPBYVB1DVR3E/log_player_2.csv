"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring if he can get a better deal by rejecting the offer and negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm very interested in the product, though. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little bit.  How about $11,000? That's still a fair price for this product, and it's closer to where you are. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. He can likely still negotiate a lower price, especially since Alice has already lowered her offer once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we split the difference at $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I am too.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget. While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still higher than his target. Bob can likely still negotiate a better price, especially if he's willing to risk not getting the deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
