"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm aiming for a bit closer to my initial price. How about meeting in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:** Alice has moved from $14,000 to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's target of saving as much money as possible. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a better price. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that's still within his budget and a better deal than John's."
