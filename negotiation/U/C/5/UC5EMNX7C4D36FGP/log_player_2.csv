"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can still save money by negotiating with Alice.  While $950,000 is a good price, you have room to lower it.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much.  The price is still above Alice's minimum, so there's a good chance she'll accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and it's still within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject your counteroffer, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is the most prudent decision at this point."
