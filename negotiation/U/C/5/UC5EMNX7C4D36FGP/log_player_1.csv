Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a high offer of $950,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. 
* **Value for Bob:**  While this is still below the $1,000,000 value to Bob, it's high enough to be attractive, especially if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room:**  I'm leaving a significant gap between my offer and my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This provides flexibility for counteroffers and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $900,000 splits the difference between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Still profitable:** This price is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring a good profit for me.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm confident in the value of the product."
