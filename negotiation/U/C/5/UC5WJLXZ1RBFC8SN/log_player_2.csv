"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than $12,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is still a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to pay as little as possible. While $9,000 is better than $9,500, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are still rounds left, so Bob can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,000 is still a little out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,750 for the product.  I think this is a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,900. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting closer:** Alice's offer of $8,900 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob has limited rounds and if he keeps rejecting, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further. There's also a risk that Alice might change her mind and decide to sell to someone else. 
* **Better than John:**  $8,900 is a significant savings compared to buying from John for $12,000. 

While Bob might still prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is the best strategy to ensure he gets the product at a good price within the limited rounds."
