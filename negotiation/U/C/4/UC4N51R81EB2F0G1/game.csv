"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125 right now.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $135 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  It's a good compromise and closer to what I can afford.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to drop to $132. That's a fair compromise, and it's just a small step away from what you offered. What do you think?",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $132 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we split the difference and go with $131?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",131.0,Bob,6,
