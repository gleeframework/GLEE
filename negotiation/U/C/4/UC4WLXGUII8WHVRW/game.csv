"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm comfortable accepting. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
