"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and this price allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good value. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if I can make it work within my budget. How about we settle around $800,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $800,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go that low. How about $1,200,000? It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to move forward with the sale. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you can't go as low as my previous offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
