"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit.  Let's make a deal!",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize the deal!",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth far more to your business in the long run. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
