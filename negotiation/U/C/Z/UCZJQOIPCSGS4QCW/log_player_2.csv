You can do better than $13,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:

You are still better off than buying from John, but you can likely negotiate a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'll meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final offer on that price point.
