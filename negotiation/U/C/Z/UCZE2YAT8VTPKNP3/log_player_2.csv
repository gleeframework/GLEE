```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than your preferred price point, but it's closer than before. Continuing to reject and counteroffer could potentially get you a better deal, especially since you have several rounds left. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a slightly lower price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $12,200 is her bottom line.  While it's still a bit more than your ideal price, it's a good deal considering:

* You're saving $2,800 compared to buying from John.
* You have a limited number of rounds remaining.
* There's a good chance Alice won't budge any further. 

It's a calculated risk, but accepting the offer is the most sensible option at this point."
