"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,425,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This seems like a fair compromise, given the value of the product.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
