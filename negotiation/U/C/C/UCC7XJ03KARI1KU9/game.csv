,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $120. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit out of my price range.  How about we try $75?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $140. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",140.0,Alice,5,
