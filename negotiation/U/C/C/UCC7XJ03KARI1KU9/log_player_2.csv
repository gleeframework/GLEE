Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $120. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $140. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly not budging much from her initial offer. She's more focused on her desired profit than finding a middle ground. At this point, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that's acceptable for you (under $80). It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $80."
