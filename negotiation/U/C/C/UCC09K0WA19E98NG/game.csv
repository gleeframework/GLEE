"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to walk away if this is not acceptable to you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
