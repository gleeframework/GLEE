"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I appreciate your perspective, that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I could consider a price of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. That said, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
