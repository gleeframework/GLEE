Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but leave yourself room to negotiate. Starting too close to Bob's valuation gives you less bargaining power.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique features and value in the market, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Confident:**  The message is direct and positions the product as valuable.
* **High Starting Point:** $1,400,000 is a strong opening within the ZOPA. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing it further"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This is just the first step.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  He might outright reject this offer, counter with a much lower price, or try to negotiate down. Your willingness to walk away (knowing you have John's offer) is your strongest tool."
