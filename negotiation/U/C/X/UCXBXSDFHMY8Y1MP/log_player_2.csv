"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal, allowing you to benefit significantly from its acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but not the best possible deal.**  You're still overpaying compared to Alice's own valuation of the product.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can try to counter-offer Alice with a lower price, aiming for a price closer to $800,000. 
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows for further negotiation.** You're not committing to buying from John just yet."
