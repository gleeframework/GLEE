Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before you have to sell to John.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob (saving him money compared to his perceived value) while maximizing your profit.  Going too close to $1,500,000 risks rejection, while lowballing leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly unique at a significant discount compared to its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting exclusivity adds perceived value and urgency.
* **Value-Based Pricing:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, justifying the price.
* **""Significant Discount"":** Framing the price as a discount makes it more psychologically appealing.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 saving while netting you a $350,000 profit over your fallback option.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style, you might adjust the price slightly."
