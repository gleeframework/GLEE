"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so there's room to lower the price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, I'm hoping to find a price point closer to $10,000 to make it a truly worthwhile investment for me. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a price point that works for you. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product at $10,500. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $11,500, which is still a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $15,000, so accepting the offer saves him $3,500 compared to buying from John. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer or increase her price.  Accepting the offer is a smart move to secure the product at a reasonable price."
