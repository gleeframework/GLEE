"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll take advantage of it.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",10800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10400.0,Alice,5,
