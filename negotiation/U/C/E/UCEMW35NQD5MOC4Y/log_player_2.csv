I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower than $10,400.  At this point, cutting my losses and buying from John for $10,000 is the most financially sound option."
