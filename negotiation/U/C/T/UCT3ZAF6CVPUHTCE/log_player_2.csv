"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $120 for you. Would you like to proceed with this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120.  This is a significant markup, and Bob should aim for a lower price.
* **Bob has room to negotiate:**  Bob has a maximum budget of $150, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **There are multiple rounds:** It's better to try and negotiate a lower price rather than accepting the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this point. Would you be open to $100? That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose we settle on $110 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer:**  Alice has lowered her price from $120 to $110, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **The price is within Bob's budget:**  $110 is still under Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **There's risk in continuing:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will continue to lower her price. She might even increase it, or the negotiation could drag on for multiple rounds.

While Bob could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal or having to pay more later outweighs the potential savings of a few dollars."
