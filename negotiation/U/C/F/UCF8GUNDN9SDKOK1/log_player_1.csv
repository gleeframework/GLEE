Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price given the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $1,400,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider it under one condition: [insert a potential concession from Bob, perhaps a shorter payment timeframe, an add-on service, or something else that adds value for you]. Would you be open to that?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a concession, but I'm not comfortable with that condition. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

At this point, Bob has met my fallback price, which is the same amount I can get from John. There's no guarantee of getting a better offer from Bob in further rounds, and risking losing both offers isn't worth it."
