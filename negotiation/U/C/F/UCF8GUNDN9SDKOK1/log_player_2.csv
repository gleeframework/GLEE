"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is much higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price given the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're suggesting is significantly below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject and counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,400,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider it under one condition: [insert a potential concession from Bob, perhaps a shorter payment timeframe, an add-on service, or something else that adds value for you]. Would you be open to that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $1,600,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a concession, but I'm not comfortable with that condition. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
