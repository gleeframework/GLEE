{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still gives me some room to negotiate if he rejects it. It's also lower than John's offer, ensuring I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000. While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm not willing to sacrifice so much profit. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about $9750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my desired price.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount, especially knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $12,000. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to push Bob a little closer to my desired price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, at $10,125.  This would allow us both to come to an agreement that is fair and mutually beneficial. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9900, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,900 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I can get from John.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $12,000 for a slightly higher offer from Bob. I'll sell the product to John."
