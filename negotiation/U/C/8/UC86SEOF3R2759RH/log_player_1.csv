Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message can build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Space for Counteroffer:**  The question ""What do you think?"" allows Bob to counter without feeling pressured. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While I could accept Bob's offer, I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to potentially secure a higher price. 

This decision allows me to maintain leverage and continue exploring options for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $110 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we split the difference at $120? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message can help maintain a good relationship with Bob during the negotiation.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us can make the offer more appealing. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. While a $5 difference may seem small, it's still a loss for me. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly better price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit of $150, which meets my minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation with Bob. 

This decision prioritizes the guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to go higher."
