{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. It leaves room for negotiation, and I can always walk away and sell to John if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! That's a nice product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,000?  This is a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down from my initial asking price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
