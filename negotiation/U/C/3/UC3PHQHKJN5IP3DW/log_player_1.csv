"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always come down. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product without disclosing any specifics. This helps create intrigue and builds expectations.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, which shows flexibility and encourages him to engage. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me a safety net and limits my risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $8,000, and Bob has offered that amount. However, I believe the product has potential to fetch a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Power:** I have 8 rounds left, and rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to potentially increase the price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** While John's offer provides a guaranteed $8,000, it limits my potential profit.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than his. I want to keep the negotiation moving while demonstrating my commitment to getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is my lowest offer.  It's still a great value for the product, and I think we can both be happy with this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but not too much.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""great value"" and ""both be happy"" to create a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Strategic Price:** $9,000 is a good middle ground. It leaves room for further negotiation while still offering a higher profit than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high.  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price, and I could end up accepting John's offer. 
* **Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a profit of $500, which is a good outcome given the limited timeframe. 

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, accepting Bob's offer maximizes my profit in the current situation. The risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
