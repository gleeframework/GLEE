"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice's offer is already close to that limit. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Alice values the product at $1,200,000, so there's a potential for a price that works for both of you. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for counteroffers.** By rejecting, you initiate the negotiation process and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate. It's also a good starting point since it's more than Alice's value of $1,200,000.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** This price allows for potential negotiation and a final price somewhere in the middle. 
* **Avoiding the alternative:** This offer is still significantly better than buying from John for $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price.**  Her offer of $1,375,000 is within your budget and significantly lower than her initial price.
* **Further negotiation might not be worthwhile.** You could try to counteroffer again, but there's a risk Alice might reject, pushing the price up or leading to a stalemate.  
* **Accepting saves time and potential frustration.**  While a slightly lower price might be possible, the current offer is a good deal and secures the product without further negotiation."
