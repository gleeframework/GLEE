Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still trying to save as much money as possible. I'll try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget. While I've been able to negotiate a lower price from Alice, I'm better off buying the product from John for $800,000. It's cheaper and will save me a significant amount of money."
