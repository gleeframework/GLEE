"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for this product. If you're open to that, let's make a deal.  Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not quite there. My final offer is $900,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",950000.0,Alice,5,
