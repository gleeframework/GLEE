"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1,500,000 to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $925,000? That's a pretty significant investment for me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the best compromise I can make, considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
