"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1400000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to consider it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1200000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
