I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a decent profit.  Let's see if Bob is willing to pay this price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm counteroffering at $110. It's still a good profit for me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a bit to reach an agreement with Bob. Hopefully, this price is attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80."
