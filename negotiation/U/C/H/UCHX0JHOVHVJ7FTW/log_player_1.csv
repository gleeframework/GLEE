Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value, I'm asking for $1,199,999. I believe this represents a fair price, especially considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price very close to your minimum ($1,199,999) sets a strong anchor. While it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, it gives you room to negotiate down slightly if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" aims to justify the high price and potentially sway Bob's perception of its worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject your initial price.  You have some leeway to negotiate down, but don't go below $1,200,000 as John provides a guaranteed sale at that price.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive relationship with Bob is important for future dealings, you might consider a slightly less aggressive opening price. However, remember you have a strong alternative buyer."
