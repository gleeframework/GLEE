Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum but still attractive to Bob. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation.  This strategy allows me to see how interested Bob is and if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. $11,000 is closer to my minimum than to Bob's maximum, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I'm also highlighting the benefit for both of us in a positive way."
