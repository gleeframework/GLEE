"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I'm confident it holds significant potential for you as well.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1500000.  This is a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still below what this product is truly worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1350000.  This reflects the value of the product and my desire to reach an agreement with you.  Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
