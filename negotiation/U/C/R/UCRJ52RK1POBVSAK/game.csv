"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a lower price, and I secure a good profit.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,050,000?  This price still gives you a significant discount and leaves room for profit. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to think about the value of the product and my budget. How about $950,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $950,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still above my minimum value and leaves room for you to make a good profit.  This is my final offer - what do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
