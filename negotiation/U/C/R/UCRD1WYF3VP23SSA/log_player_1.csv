Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob a price that's appealing.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to go significantly above that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $11,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so she doesn't need to go below that price. 

By starting at $11,000, Alice aims to:

1.  **Secure a quick sale:** Bob might take the deal immediately, netting Alice a good profit.
2.  **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If Bob counter-offers, Alice can gauge how much he's willing to pay and adjust accordingly."
