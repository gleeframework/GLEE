"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $16,000 to make it worth my while. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $14,500 to make this deal worthwhile. Can we meet in the middle again, but this time at $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,250 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy with the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the wire, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still above my budget. How about we settle on $12,500? This price is a good compromise for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm happy to sell you the product. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",13000.0,Alice,9,
