Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still net a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), providing room for negotiation.
    * Still a considerable discount from John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to engage in discussions. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price exceeding your minimum while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
