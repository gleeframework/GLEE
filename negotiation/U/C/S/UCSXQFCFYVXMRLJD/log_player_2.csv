"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $8,500. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $9,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still offering a good deal for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, I'm still hoping to get a lower price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Alice, as there are still rounds left and I haven't exhausted all my options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $8,750. This is a modest increase from my previous offer, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. I'm still aiming to get a price closer to my ideal target, but also need to be mindful of the limited rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still better than John's price, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get Alice to come down a bit further. It's still early in the negotiation process and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's latest offer of $9,600. This shows Alice I'm serious about reaching an agreement, but I'm also trying to close the gap and find a price we can both agree on.  We are getting close to the end of the rounds, and I need to be mindful of that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,650 is better than buying from John, but still not ideal. We're getting close to the end of the rounds, and I'm still hopeful to get a slightly better price. There's still a chance Alice may lower her offer, especially since I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  I'm also cautious about accepting an offer that's only marginally better than John's, as I might miss out on a better deal by making a hasty decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final attempt to negotiate a better price.  I'm increasing my offer to $9,200, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  However, I'm still trying to secure a lower price than Alice's latest offer of $9,650.  This is a high-stakes move as we only have two rounds left. If Alice rejects, I'll be forced to buy from John.  But, I'm hoping that my willingness to compromise will convince her to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left, it's unlikely I'll get Alice to agree to a price lower than her current offer of $9,700.  Since this is still better than John's $10,000, it's more logical to purchase from John to secure the product.  Although I'm paying a little more than I hoped, it's the most reasonable option given the limited time remaining and the likelihood Alice won't budge further."
