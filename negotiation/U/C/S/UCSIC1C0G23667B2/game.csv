"I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",150.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $130 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my final offer.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you won't regret buying it at this price.",140.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I'm really trying to work with you here, but $135 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $137.50.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll receive.",137.5,Alice,7,
