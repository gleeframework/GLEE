I'm starting with a price a little higher than my minimum, but I want to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 150}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $130 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $140, but that's my final offer.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you won't regret buying it at this price."", ""product_price"": 140}

I've reached a point where I'm concerned I won't be able to get a higher offer from Bob. It's getting close to my minimum, but I only have a couple of rounds left, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to close the deal. Since John is willing to pay my desired price, it's time to secure the sale with him."
