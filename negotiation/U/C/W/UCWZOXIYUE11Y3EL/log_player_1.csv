Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you at $7,800.  That's a very competitive offer, and I'm hopeful we can close this deal.

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point. It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk Bob not coming up to a satisfactory price within the remaining rounds."
