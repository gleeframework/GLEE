"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects its exceptional value, while also providing you with a significant return on your investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to her desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This would still give you a substantial profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
