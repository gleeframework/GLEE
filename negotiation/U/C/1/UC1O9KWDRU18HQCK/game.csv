"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to offer $11,000 for it. How does that sound?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects the value it will bring to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $14,000, which would be $13,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to my limit. How about we settle this right now at $12,500? ",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to make one last concession to get this sale done. I'll meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is a great price for a high-quality product like this, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",13500.0,Alice,7,
