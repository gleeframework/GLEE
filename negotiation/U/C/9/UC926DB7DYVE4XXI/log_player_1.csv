Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, and it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'll be keeping my minimum price in mind throughout the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $20,000. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still within a reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I believe it's a fair price that gives Bob a good deal while allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a good deal given the current negotiations.  I'm happy to close the deal and move on."
