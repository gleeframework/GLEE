Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:**  Starting at $1,000,000 gives me a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob. It's a starting point for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:**  $1,000,000 is still below the product's value to Bob ($800,000), so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **My Value:** This offer is above my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can be more assertive in negotiations without being desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is below his stated value, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Power:**  I have the upper hand. John's offer provides a strong safety net. 
* **Counteroffer:**  I can likely get a better price by countering Bob's offer. A counteroffer closer to $900,000 might be attractive to him while still giving me a good profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This offer splits the difference between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $750,000.
* **Significant Discount:**  I emphasize that this is a considerable discount from my initial price, implying I'm willing to negotiate but also not desperate. 
* **Fair Deal:**  Framing it as a fair deal for both parties could increase Bob's likelihood of acceptance.
* **John as Safety Net:**  I am still confident that if Bob rejects this counteroffer, I can sell to John and get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I can get a significantly better price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether and ensures I get a reasonable price.

**Overall, it's a calculated risk. I'm taking the offer because it's close to my minimum, and I believe it's the best option at this point.**"
