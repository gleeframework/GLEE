I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can push him higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell. I'm aiming for a middle ground that both of us can be happy with."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, we're running out of rounds and the risk of not closing the deal is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price, and I don't want to gamble with my minimum."
