"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there.  I can offer you $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. While I understand the value of the product,  I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000, but I need to make a profit, so I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
