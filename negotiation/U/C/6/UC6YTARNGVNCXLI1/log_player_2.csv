Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,075,000, but I need to make a profit, so I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still above my target price of $1,000,000, but it's closer than John's offer.  Since this is her final offer, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a lower price.  Accepting now allows me to buy the product for a price that's still within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
