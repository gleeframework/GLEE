Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. I hope Bob sees this as a fair price and is willing to move closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I'm going to take John's offer, which is a safe and reasonable price for the product."
