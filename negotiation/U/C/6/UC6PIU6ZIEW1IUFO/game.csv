"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your guns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
