While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $8,125 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Exceeds my minimum:**  It's more than the $8,000 I'm guaranteed from John.
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  He's signaled this is his limit, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainty that come with continued negotiation or switching to John."
