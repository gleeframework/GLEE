"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at $1,300,000. We understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and we aim to bridge the gap while maximizing our earnings. Let's discuss how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to him. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
