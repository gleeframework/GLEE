"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and attempt to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. While this is closer to my target price, I'm still aiming to save as much as possible. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get an even lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000. This is very close to my ideal price point of $1,050,000. It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate further and get a lower price.  It's much better to accept this offer and save $425,000 compared to buying from John."
