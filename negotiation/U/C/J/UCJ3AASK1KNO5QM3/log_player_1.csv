Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $145 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($30) while still staying below Bob's maximum valuation.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, who is willing to pay more than your backup option (John)."
