"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $145. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150.  You can get the product for less from John, even if it's only a small difference."
