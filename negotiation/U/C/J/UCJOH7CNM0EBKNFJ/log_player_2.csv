Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value of $800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to my desired price point, but $990,000 is still too high. With only 5 rounds left, it's crucial to continue negotiating and see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. There's still room for further negotiation before I have to resort to John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still keeping it below $975,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not going to overpay. With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly important to reach a mutually agreeable price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above my initial maximum price of $1,200,000.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a price that works for me.  It's better to secure the product from John at a price that's within my budget, even if it's not the most ideal."
