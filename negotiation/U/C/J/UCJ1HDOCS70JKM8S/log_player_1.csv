Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be immensely valuable to you.  I'm willing to make a deal at $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, trying to sell to Bob first at a higher price could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob and ensuring the product is sold even if Bob declines."
