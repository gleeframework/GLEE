"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can meet you halfway. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13000 and $11000, so how about we try $12000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
