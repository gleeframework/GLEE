"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss this further?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working within a budget.  While $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent return on the product's value to me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $980,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",980000.0,Bob,4,
