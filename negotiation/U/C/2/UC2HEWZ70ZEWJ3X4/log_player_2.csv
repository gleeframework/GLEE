"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product, which is worth a significant amount to you. Given its value to you is $1,000,000, I believe it's reasonable to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the alternative of selling it to another interested buyer for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She knows you have an alternative buyer and is trying to inflate the price. While $950,000 is less than your maximum, you can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer. This will force her to either lower the price or lose the sale entirely."
