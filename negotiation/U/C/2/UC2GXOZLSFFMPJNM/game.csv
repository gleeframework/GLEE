"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product. I think it could be a game-changer for you. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product is valuable, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understanding the value of this product. While your budget is understandable, $900,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  To make this work, I could come down to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, what do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to see this deal through.  While $1,050,000 is closer to your budget, it's a significant drop for me.  My best offer is $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair.  Let me know if it works for you.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
