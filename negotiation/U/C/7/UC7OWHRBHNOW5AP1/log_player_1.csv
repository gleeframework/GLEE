Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable value of $150.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the fact that I could sell it to John for the same amount."
