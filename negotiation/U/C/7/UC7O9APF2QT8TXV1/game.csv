"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to the value this product represents, I can't go below $1,650,000.  This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,650,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This represents a significant step towards meeting your needs, and I believe it's a fair price for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's try to bridge the gap.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
