Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're guaranteed to make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response, potentially achieving a price closer to your ideal.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if you feel the negotiation with Bob isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is still a profit for you, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to push for a slightly higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a price closer to your original offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and potentially gets you a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $12,500? That leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but are not ready to settle at Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Maintain profit:**  $12,500 is still above your minimum and potentially within Bob's range. 
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation open. 

This counteroffer positions you well for a potential agreement or further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12,500 is a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? That way, we can both be happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $12,250 is very close to your previous offer of $12,500.  It's a fair compromise that allows you to close the deal and get a good profit. 

While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  At this point, accepting his offer ensures a successful sale with a reasonable profit."
