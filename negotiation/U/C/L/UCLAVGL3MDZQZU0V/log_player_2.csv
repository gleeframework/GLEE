"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can then counteroffer and see if you can reach an agreement.  Buying from John is always an option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. This gives us room to negotiate.  If Alice is motivated to sell, she might be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my budget.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option if negotiations with Alice fail, but I'm hoping to get the product for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  $950,000 is still within my budget, and it's a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers.  This should hopefully encourage Alice to accept, but if not, I'm still prepared to walk away and buy from John."
