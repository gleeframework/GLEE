"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I really believe this product would be a great fit for my operations, but I have to be mindful of our budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 is too far below my asking price to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows us both to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within our budget constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
