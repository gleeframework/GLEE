"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $22,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has clearly stated his maximum price is $12,000. Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Accepting the $15,000 from John guarantees the best possible outcome at this point."
