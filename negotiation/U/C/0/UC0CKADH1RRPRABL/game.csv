"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in similar sales. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I can afford it. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and I'll meet you halfway from my original price of $1200000. I'm offering the product to you for $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in similar sales. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $975000. I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I can afford it. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
