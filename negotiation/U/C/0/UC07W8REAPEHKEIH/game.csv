"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one final offer, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,7,
