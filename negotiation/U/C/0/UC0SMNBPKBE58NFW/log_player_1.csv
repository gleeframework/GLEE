Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by expressing enthusiasm and highlighting the ""opportunity."" This frames the offer positively.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The phrase ""given its value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the product is worth a significant amount.
* **High but Negotiable:** Offering the product at $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it sets a strong anchor point. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends by asking for Bob's thoughts, encouraging a dialogue and potential counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making a deal with Bob more likely than selling to John for the minimum price.  If Bob negotiates down, there's still a good chance of securing a price significantly higher than $1,500,000."
