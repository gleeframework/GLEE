"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $9,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it at a lower price point. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to negotiate a lower price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,200. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",8200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,600?  I believe this price point reflects both the value and my budget.",7600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price point of $7,600. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I propose a price of $8,500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and your budget.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we are struggling to find a price that works for both of us.  To be upfront, I need to stay closer to $7,000.  Would you consider $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price point of $7,800. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, and I propose a price of $8,200. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to prioritize my own interests as well.",8200.0,Alice,7,
