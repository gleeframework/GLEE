"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $85 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $85 is higher than your maximum budget of $80 and higher than John's offer.  You should reject it and either try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
