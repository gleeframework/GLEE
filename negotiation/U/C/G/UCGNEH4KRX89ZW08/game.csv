"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price, perhaps around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm unable to go as low as $850,000.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 to facilitate the deal.  This still allows you a significant profit margin, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
