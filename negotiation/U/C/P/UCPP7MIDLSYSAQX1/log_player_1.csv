{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a starting point, as I want to maximize my earnings but also keep Bob engaged.  $13,000 is a good middle ground, leaving room for negotiation and ensuring a fair deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
