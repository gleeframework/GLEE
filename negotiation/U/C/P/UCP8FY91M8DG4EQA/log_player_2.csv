"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your original price. However,  I'm really looking to get this product for closer to $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
