Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,100 is close to what I'm willing to accept, I still think I can get a little bit more. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been looking into other options as well, and I think I can secure the product for $9,100 elsewhere. However, I would like to make a final counteroffer of $9,125. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.
