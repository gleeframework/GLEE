""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $800,000. Let me know if that works for you."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is far below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be honest, I'm starting to think this negotiation isn't going anywhere. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, this is your last chance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and it's unlikely she'll come down significantly from her $1,100,000 offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, we risk pushing her away completely.  Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees we stay within our budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
