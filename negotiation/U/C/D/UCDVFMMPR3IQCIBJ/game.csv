"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $800,000. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is far below the value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates how serious I am about acquiring this product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be honest, I'm starting to think this negotiation isn't going anywhere. However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll accept $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. If you're truly serious about acquiring this product, this is your last chance.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
