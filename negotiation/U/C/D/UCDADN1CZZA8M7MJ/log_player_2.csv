"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,350,000) is higher than your maximum price ($1,000,000) and what John offers.
* You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a lower price. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she'll come down to a more acceptable price or proceed with buying from John."
