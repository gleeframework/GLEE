"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is overpriced. We have plenty of room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give ourselves bargaining room. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is courteous but makes it clear we're looking for a substantial price reduction.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $100?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $100 is still above our target price. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate further and see if we can get closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer ($90) and her counteroffer ($100). This shows a willingness to compromise but keeps us moving towards our desired price range.
* **Limited Time:**  We still have several rounds left, but time is a factor. Offering a price slightly above our ideal target helps to speed up the negotiation process. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We continue to be polite and appreciative of Alice's time and willingness to negotiate."
