"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than what he'd pay John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,500 for the product. This aligns with its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10250? This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Savings:** Accepting Alice's offer at $10,250 saves Bob $1,750 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob could try to counter-offer again, there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate further. 
* **Value:** $10,250 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to his initial limit.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer seems like the most logical choice to maximize savings while securing the product."
