"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I can't go as low as $8,200. Would you consider $8,750? That's a significant compromise on my end and reflects the true value of this product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
