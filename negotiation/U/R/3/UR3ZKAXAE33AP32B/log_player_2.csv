"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price point. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal.  There's also the option of buying from John, but you want to see if you can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my own needs.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of $1,000,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  John's offer is still a viable option, but there's still room to potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as it's my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this, or we can consider alternative options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm confident that the product's value will be evident once you've had a chance to use it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While the negotiation is getting closer to your target price, you're running out of rounds.  It's time to lock in a guaranteed price with John.  You've shown Alice you're a serious buyer, and you may be able to revisit the deal with her later if you end up needing a similar product."
