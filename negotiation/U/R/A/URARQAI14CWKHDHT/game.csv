"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $1,050,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,100,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,050,000, so I'll offer $1,075,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
