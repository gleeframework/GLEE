"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your candor. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than similar items on the market due to [briefly mention a unique feature or benefit]. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,075,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
