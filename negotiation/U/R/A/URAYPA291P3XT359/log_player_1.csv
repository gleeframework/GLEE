I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower.  How about $1,250,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gives us room to work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  That's a solid price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
