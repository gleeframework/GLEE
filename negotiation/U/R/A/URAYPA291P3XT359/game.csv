"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a fair price that reflects the product's worth. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower.  How about $1,250,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gives us room to work with.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to negotiate a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  That's a solid price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,320,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
