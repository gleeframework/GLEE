"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but I can't go lower than $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, but I know the value this product holds. Would you consider $1,075,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
