Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob without me having to immediately drop to his valuation.
* **Motivating Bob:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000, which gives me a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** I can still negotiate with Bob and try to reach a higher price. 
* **John is a secure backup:** If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for a higher price.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price is still fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:**  I'm  meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $10,500, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Encouraging further negotiation:**  I'm using language that encourages Bob to come back with a counteroffer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $12,000.

I will make another counteroffer in the next round."
