,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $7500.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm happy to pay $8500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $9200, but that's as low as I can go. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.",9200.0,Alice,5,
