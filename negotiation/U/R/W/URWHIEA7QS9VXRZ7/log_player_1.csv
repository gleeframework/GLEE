"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible while still ensuring a significant profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to counter with a higher price, but I'll need to be careful not to scare him off completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from my initial offer to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a good profit.  $900,000 is a reasonable compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now within my acceptable range, and it's getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure the sale and avoid the risk of losing Bob as a buyer entirely."
