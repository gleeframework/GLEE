"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate down, but I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $8,000, and I know that Bob is willing to pay more. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, given your interest in the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's a bit lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, even though it's closer to my minimum price. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to come up a little higher. I'm still confident I can get a better price, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 just isn't quite enough for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,250?  I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between our current positions. I've come down a little further, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my target. Hopefully, this shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a solution that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my desired price and it's a good compromise. It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and it's a good outcome considering the negotiations."
