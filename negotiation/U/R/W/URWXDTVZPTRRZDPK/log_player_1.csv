Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. It's higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to sell for $8,000, I'm not going to accept his first offer. I want to see if I can get a slightly higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage Bob to come up a bit while still being a reasonable price for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'd rather sell to John for $8,000 than risk further negotiation with Bob."
