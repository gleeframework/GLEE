"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $120? That's still a great deal for this product!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but my maximum budget is $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a little over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $95 is still a little below what I'm hoping for. How about $105?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",105.0,Alice,7,
