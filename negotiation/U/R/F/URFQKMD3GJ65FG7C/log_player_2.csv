Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above his maximum budget.  He should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within his budget. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down. He's aiming to get a deal closer to his target price of $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still within Bob's budget and significantly lower than her initial offer. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ending up having to buy from John for $1,500,000 is high. Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is still advantageous for him."
