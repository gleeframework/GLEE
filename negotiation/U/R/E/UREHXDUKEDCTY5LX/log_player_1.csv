""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer while still staying above your minimum price.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

By offering the product at $925,000, Alice aims to capture a significant portion of the value it holds for Bob, while still ensuring a substantial profit above her minimum selling price."
