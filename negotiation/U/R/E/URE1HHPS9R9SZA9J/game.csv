"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $700,000? This would be a good deal for me while still giving you a significant return.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This price reflects the value of the product and is closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Alice,5,
