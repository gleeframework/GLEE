"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $150, but $120 is still a significant amount more than what the product is worth to you. 
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** You have room to bargain and potentially get a better price.  There's a chance you can convince Alice to lower the price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback.**  You have a backup option if negotiations fail, so there's no immediate urgency to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer ($120) but still leaves some room for potential negotiation.  You're aiming for a fair price that reflects the product's value to you and Alice.
* **A reasonable starting point:** This price is within your budget and offers a compromise between your desired price and Alice's offer. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** You're open to further negotiation if Alice rejects your counteroffer, but you're not willing to pay $120."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $130 is still more than you're willing to pay right now.
* **Negotiation is still worth trying.**  You're closer to your desired price, and there's still room for Alice to move.
* **Buying from John is a safety net.**  You have a backup option, so you can afford to be patient and try to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Alice's price ($130) but still lower than her offer.
* **Testing the waters:** This price is likely in the ""sweet spot"" where Alice might be willing to accept, especially if she's motivated to sell. 
* **Potential for a final deal:**  If this counteroffer is rejected, you might need to consider buying from John, as further negotiation could lead to a stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer, but still too high.**  You're approaching your maximum price point, and further negotiation is unlikely to get you a better deal.
* **Risk of a stalemate.** Alice might be unwilling to budge further, and you're at risk of getting stuck in a loop of counteroffers.
* **Buying from John is the best option.**  Since you have a reliable alternative with John, buying from him at $150 is the most sensible decision at this point. It ensures you get the product without further risk or delay."
