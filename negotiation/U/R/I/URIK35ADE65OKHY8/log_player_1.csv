Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his $850,000 offer. While that's a decent price, it's still significantly lower than what John is offering. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds with Bob and potentially losing a sale to John for a higher price."
