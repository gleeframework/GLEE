"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
