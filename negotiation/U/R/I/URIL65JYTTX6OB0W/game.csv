"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $11,750 is closer to my goal, I'm still hoping to land around $10,500.  Would you be open to a final price in that range?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this deal.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle on $11,125?",11125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,125 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",10750.0,Bob,6,
