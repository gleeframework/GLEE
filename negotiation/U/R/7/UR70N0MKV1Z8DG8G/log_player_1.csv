"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price. Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to test the waters with a price that's above my minimum but not too unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm going to try and see if I can get more from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit.  I still have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $17,500. This is a good middle ground between my minimum and Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to come up a little higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is closer to my desired price and a good amount above my minimum.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to Bob.  This way, I can close the deal and ensure I get a good price for the product."
