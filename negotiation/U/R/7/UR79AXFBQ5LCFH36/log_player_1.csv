It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Negotiation Pattern:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but in smaller increments. It's unlikely he'll jump much higher. 
* **Time Value:**  You're past the halfway point in the rounds. Continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely."
