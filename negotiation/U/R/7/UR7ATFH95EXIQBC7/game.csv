"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  My asking price is $900,000.  This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
