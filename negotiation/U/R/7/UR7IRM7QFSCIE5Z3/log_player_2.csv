Alice is clearly trying to come down to a price that works for you, while still maximizing her profit. At $765,000, you're getting a significant discount from her initial offer and are well below your $1,000,000 maximum. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make her less willing to work with you."
