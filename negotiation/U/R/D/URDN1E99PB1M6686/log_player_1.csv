"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counter with a lower price in the next round to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,100,000 is too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still a bit above my target price, and I believe I can get a slightly higher offer if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can do $1,200,000. Can you meet me at this price?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, I've already rejected his offer several times and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a sale at $1,200,000 than to risk losing the deal completely and having to sell to John for a significantly lower price."
