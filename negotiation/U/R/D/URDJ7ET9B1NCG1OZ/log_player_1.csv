Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product.  However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer because I know the product is worth more than $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but I'm still only comfortable with $16000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can agree on this. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a good deal, especially given the limited rounds. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale above my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
