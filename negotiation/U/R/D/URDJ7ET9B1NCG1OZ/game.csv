"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering the product.  However, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $15000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle?",18000.0,Alice,3,
