Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $120, our goal is to maximize profit.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price with John creates a sense of urgency and perceived value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested."
