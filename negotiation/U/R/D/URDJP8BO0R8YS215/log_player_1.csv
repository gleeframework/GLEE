I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum, and we're getting closer to a deal.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by being too stubborn."
