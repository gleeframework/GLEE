Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.

Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, as she has moved closer to his desired price. He can try to counteroffer again and potentially get the price even lower."

Bob should buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,075,000, and that price is still higher than what John is offering.  It's best for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John and save the additional $75,000."
