"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my original offer. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
