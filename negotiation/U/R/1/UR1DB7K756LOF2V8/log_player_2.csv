"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $140. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130 for this product. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer of $135 is well within that range.
* **Potential Savings:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject further counteroffers, potentially leading to buying from John at a higher price.
* **Time:**  Accepting now ensures a deal with Alice without further negotiation rounds."
