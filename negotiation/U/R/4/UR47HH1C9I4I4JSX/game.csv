"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,100,000.  I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit outside my budget.  I could make a move up to $725,000. Let me know what you think.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, the gap between our positions is still substantial. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position, but that final offer is still a stretch for me. To be honest, my absolute limit is $800,000.  If you're unable to meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
