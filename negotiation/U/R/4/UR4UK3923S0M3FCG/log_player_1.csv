"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still above Bob's offer. This shows good faith while demonstrating that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original asking price, Bob has increased his offer and it's only round 4.  Accepting this offer will ensure I get a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale completely if I continue to counteroffer."
