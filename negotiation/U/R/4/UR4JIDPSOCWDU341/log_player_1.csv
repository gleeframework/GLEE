Send your offer to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I could offer you $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This is a fair offer considering its value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While we could try to push for more, Bob offering $800,000 meets my minimum selling price and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to go with John's offer, which would net me the same amount."
