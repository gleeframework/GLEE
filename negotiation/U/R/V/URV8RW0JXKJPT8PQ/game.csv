"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1400000 is significantly lower than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go below $1700000.  This price still represents a great value for you, considering the potential benefits of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1600000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1600000 is still a bit too low for me.  To show you I'm serious about reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1650000. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let's finalize this agreement!",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1580000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I believe this is a fair compromise.",1580000.0,Bob,6,
