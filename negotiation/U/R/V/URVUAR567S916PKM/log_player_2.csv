It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can counteroffer Alice and see if she's willing to come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $11000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $15,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and saving $4,000 compared to buying from John."
