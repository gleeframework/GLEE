The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking for $100. This is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While John offers the product for $80, Alice's offer is only $5 more.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice and having to buy from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to get the product quickly and still be within your budget."
