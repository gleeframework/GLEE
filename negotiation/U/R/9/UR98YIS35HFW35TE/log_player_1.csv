Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This would still be a good profit for you, and it would allow me to make this purchase work.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
