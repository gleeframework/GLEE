"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. This would still be a good profit for you, and it would allow me to make this purchase work.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling the product for $750,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $800,000? This would give you a good profit, and it's the highest I can comfortably pay at this time.",800000.0,Bob,4,
