"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I'm confident it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its worth to you is $120, I propose we aim for a fair transaction. Would you be interested in purchasing the product for $110? This price reflects its value while allowing us both to benefit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
