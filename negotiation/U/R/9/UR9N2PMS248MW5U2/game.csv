"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $900000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $750000 for it.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there though.  How about $800000?  That's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",800000.0,Bob,4,
