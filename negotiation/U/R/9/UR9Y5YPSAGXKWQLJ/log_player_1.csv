Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1,000,000, and I believe it holds even greater value for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm aiming for a higher price, and $1,200,000 is still too low.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my original price, but still above Bob's offer.  This will keep the negotiations going while showing I'm flexible."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, keeping the price closer to my preferred range.  We're getting closer to a deal, so I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $1,180,000 is still too far below my valuation. How about we settle on $1,220,000? This price is a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1220000}

We're approaching the halfway point, and while I'm eager to make a deal, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to compromise a little further, but $1,150,000 is still too low.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and while Bob is getting closer, the price is still below my desired range.  With only a few rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't reach a mutually acceptable price.  To ensure I secure a minimum profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  This is the guaranteed minimum, and it's safer than risking a lower price or running out of rounds."
