"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $15,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $14,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's worth it to me at that price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate further, but $14,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle again - $14,750. It's a fair compromise and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",14750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - $14,375. Would you be willing to accept that price?",14375.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  we're getting closer!  $14,375 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and ensures a smooth transaction. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $14,500. I'm willing to go up to $14,250, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll make the deal.",14250.0,Bob,8,
