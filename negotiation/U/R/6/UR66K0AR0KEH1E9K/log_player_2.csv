"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product at a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $14,000 is close to my limit, there's room for negotiation. Alice clearly values the product lower, so I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. Could we settle on $13,000?  It's a small compromise for a product you'll greatly benefit from. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Reason: Alice is coming down, which is good.  While $13,000 is a decent price, I think there's still room to negotiate a little further down towards my $11,000 offer."
