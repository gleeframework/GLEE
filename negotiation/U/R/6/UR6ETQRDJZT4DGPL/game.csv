"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 right now.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I've done extensive research and analysis on this product, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This offer reflects its value while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
