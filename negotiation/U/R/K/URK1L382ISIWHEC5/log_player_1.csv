Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Bob's higher valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) or John's offer.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still keeping you well above your minimum.
* **Balance risk and reward:** While a higher initial offer might scare Bob away, a significantly lower offer risks leaving money on the table. This price aims to maximize your potential profit while still securing the sale. 

**Important Note:** This assumes a one-shot negotiation. If multiple rounds of offers are possible, the strategy might change."
