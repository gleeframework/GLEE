"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  He should proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm ready to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is closer to his budget than the previous offer, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He should proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,000, so I'll sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  Since Bob has the option to purchase the product from John for $8,000, he should choose this option.  It saves him $1,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
