"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $400,000. I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $550,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know what you think.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $450,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $500,000.
