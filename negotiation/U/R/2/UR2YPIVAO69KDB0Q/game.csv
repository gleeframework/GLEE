"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise between our initial offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. How about we try $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to make a concession, but I think $1200000 is the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I'm willing to make a further concession. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1050000 is the maximum I can go. Can we try that?",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the price I'd be willing to sell to John for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you halfway again, but I think $1150000 is the minimum I can accept. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll meet you halfway again, but I think $1225000 is the minimum I can accept. I'm not willing to go any lower than that, and I'm starting to think it's time for us to part ways. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",1225000.0,Alice,9,

I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1050000 is the maximum I can go. Unfortunately, I think we've reached a stalemate, and I'm not willing to go any higher.
