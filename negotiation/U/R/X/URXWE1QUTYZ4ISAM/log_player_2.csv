It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can get a better price than $1,100,000."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer of $950,000.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget. It's a good starting point to see if she's willing to negotiate."

Alice has moved a little closer to my price point, but I can still do better. I will counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is a good price for me.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price.  This is a good deal for me."
