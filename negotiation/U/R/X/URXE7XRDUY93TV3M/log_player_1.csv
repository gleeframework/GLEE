Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  This is a fair price considering its unique features and benefits.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downward if needed. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and create a sense of potential benefit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by explicitly stating that I'm open to discussing the price, letting Bob know that negotiation is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the unique features you mentioned, $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  There's no real benefit to rejecting his offer and counter-offering. I'm unlikely to get a higher price from Bob, and I risk losing the sale entirely.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Selling to John is an option, but it's not clear how long that opportunity will remain open. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum price."
