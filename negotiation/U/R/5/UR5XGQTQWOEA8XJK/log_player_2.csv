"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000. He has a safety net of $1,200,000 with John. There's room for negotiation to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is closer to Alice's desired price but still significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate.  It leaves room for further negotiation while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good price considering John's offer.  There is potential to negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting again and Bob ending up with John's higher price outweighs the potential savings."
