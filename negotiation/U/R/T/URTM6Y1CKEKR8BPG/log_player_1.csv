Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love!  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, hoping to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message doesn't state the price is ""final,"" leaving the door open for a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I can then assess if his counteroffer is reasonable, or if I should move on to John who will pay the minimum I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is the Minimum:**  Bob is offering $80, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product.
* **No Room for Higher Profit:**  There's no potential to earn more with further negotiation, as John is also willing to pay $80.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take time and effort, while accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at my minimum price.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It secures the sale without further negotiation and ensures I receive the minimum value I set for the product."
