"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. I'm offering you the product for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my absolute maximum is $9,000.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $13,000, which is $11,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal at $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm ready to make a deal at $10,000.  This is the absolute most I can offer.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more move. I'm going to meet you at $10,500, which is the closest I can get to my minimum price of $12,000 without going over. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,7,
