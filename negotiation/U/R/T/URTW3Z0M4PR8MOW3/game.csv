,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1000000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $950000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $950000. I'd be willing to meet you at $920000. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",920000.0,Bob,6,
