"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $11,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,200? Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $10,200 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not quite there. How about $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $10,250? I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Can you consider it?",10250.0,Bob,6,
