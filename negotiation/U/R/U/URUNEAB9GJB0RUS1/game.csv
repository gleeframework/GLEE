"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me and leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $850,000. Let's meet in the middle - how about $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $875,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $875,000, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make this a truly mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to pay $860,000. It's a small difference, but it's important to me to get the best value possible. Let's close this deal now and avoid further negotiation.",860000.0,Bob,6,
