"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not sure about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Can you meet me at that price?,9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $9500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not at the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",9750.0,Bob,6,
