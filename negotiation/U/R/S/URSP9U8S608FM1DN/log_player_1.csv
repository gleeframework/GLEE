"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still not quite at my desired price point, but I'm getting closer. I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still too low for me. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about making a deal with you."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're clearly motivated to sell, and I appreciate that.  Let's close the gap.  How about $1,000,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, but I'm running out of time, and I can't risk going further with the negotiations.  I'm confident John will purchase the product for the same amount,  so I'll sell to him to ensure a quick and secure deal."
