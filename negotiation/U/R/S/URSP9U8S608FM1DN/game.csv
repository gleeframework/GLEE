"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. I understand its worth to you and I'm confident it'll be a great investment.  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $975,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still too low for me. Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that shows I'm serious about making a deal with you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're clearly motivated to sell, and I appreciate that.  Let's close the gap.  How about $1,000,000?  That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
