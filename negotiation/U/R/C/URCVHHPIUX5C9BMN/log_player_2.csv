Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is still above my ideal price, it's within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a lower price.  I'm comfortable accepting this offer and avoiding the higher cost of buying from John."
