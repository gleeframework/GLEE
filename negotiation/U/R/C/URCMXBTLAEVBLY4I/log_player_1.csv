Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  A starting price of $16,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a profit above your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, you can always propose a lower price, moving closer to your minimum acceptable amount."
