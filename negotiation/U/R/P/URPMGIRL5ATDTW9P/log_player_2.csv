"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and it represents a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  Consider this a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. He can get the product from John for a lower price, saving $200,000."
