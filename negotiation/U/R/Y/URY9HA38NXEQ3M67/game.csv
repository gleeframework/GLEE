"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a better price for my product.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $112.50?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
