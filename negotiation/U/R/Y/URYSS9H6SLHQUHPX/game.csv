"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $15000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's try $14250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great value for the product.",14250.0,Alice,5,
