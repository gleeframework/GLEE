Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $13,000 is still below my minimum value. I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway, but still ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value. I believe this is a fair offer, and hopefully, Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my initial goal, it's above my minimum value and a reasonable compromise.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
