"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This should pique Bob's interest as it's below his value, but also shows I'm not giving it away. I'll gauge his response and adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to try and get more. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $10,500.  This shows flexibility, while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum. If he rejects this, I'm more likely to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John, but I want to see if we can bridge the gap first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price. However, with John's offer of $10,000 still on the table, it's a safer bet to sell to him. There's no guarantee that Bob will come back with a better offer, and I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed profit."
