{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, knowing this is likely a lowball offer.  Alice has a high value for the product and might be willing to negotiate. If she rejects, I can either try a slightly higher counteroffer or go directly to John for the product."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget of $800,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get the price closer to my target. There's a chance she might be willing to compromise further to avoid losing the deal entirely."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying below my maximum budget. This counteroffer is a compromise that could be appealing to Alice as she might be willing to accept a price closer to her desired value than my initial offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $950,000. If she rejects my next counteroffer, I'll consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time, showing that I'm getting closer to my limit.  The goal is to tempt Alice closer to my desired price point while leaving room for a final counteroffer if necessary. If she rejects, I will seriously consider buying from John."
