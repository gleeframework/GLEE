Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value.  I'll be prepared to counter any offers Bob might make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I want to sell, I can't accept such a significant loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm lowering the price to $1,250,000, still significantly higher than Bob's offer but a step towards finding a compromise. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering $1,100,000. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still not close enough to my minimum acceptable value. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations, and it seems like we're unlikely to reach an agreeable price. It's time to move on to a more promising opportunity with John."
