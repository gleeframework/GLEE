"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to counter with a price of $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice.  While your product is good, $1,300,000 is a bit too far from what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'd like to counter with a price of $1,250,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
