{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $100, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. It also shows you're confident in the value of the product, which can encourage Bob to take you seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price of $100.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing. I'll accept his offer."
