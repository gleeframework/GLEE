"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. However, I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in discussing the price? If not, don't worry; I have another potential buyer, John, who is ready to purchase it for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
