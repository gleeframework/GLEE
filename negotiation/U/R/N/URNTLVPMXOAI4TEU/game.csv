"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I'm confident that we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $860,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",880000.0,Alice,7,
