"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I'm confident that we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to spend no more than $800,000, and her initial price is $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in it.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high. You can likely squeeze out a bit more by continuing to negotiate.  Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, so you have leverage."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $860,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 860000}
