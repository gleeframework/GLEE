"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than that. Considering the value you've placed on it, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
