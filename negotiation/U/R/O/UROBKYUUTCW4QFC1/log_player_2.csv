"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept the first offer. By rejecting, you can potentially get a lower price from Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $137.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $150 to $137.50, which is a significant reduction.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will either hold firm or become less interested in selling to you. Accepting the offer saves you $12.50 compared to John's price and avoids further negotiation."
