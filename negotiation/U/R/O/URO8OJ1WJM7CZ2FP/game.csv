"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price is fair considering the product's worth to you and my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone.  Considering the product's value to me and our progress so far, I'm offering $900,000. This feels like a fair price that allows us both to come away happy. Let's make this deal happen!",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. My counteroffer is $925,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm hoping we can make this work.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $912,500. I truly believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's wrap this up!",912500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $912,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're getting close to a fair price. My counteroffer is $920,000 for the product. This is my final concession, and I hope we can agree on this price.",920000.0,Alice,7,
