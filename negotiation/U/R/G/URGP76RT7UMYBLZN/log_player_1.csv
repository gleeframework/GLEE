"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as fair, which could encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to get a price closer to my desired range. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a significant profit, and it's closer to the value I'm looking for. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is closer but still a touch high. What do you think about meeting in the middle at $775,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $775,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $812,500. This price is fair considering the value of the product to you, and it's still within my acceptable range. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $793,750 to get this deal done today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $793,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $793,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I need to be careful not to push him away completely. I need to find a balance between maximizing my profit and not risking losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're close to an agreement. I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's finalize this deal today."", ""product_price"": 800000}
