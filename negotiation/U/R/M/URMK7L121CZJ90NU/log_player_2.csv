"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's room for negotiation, and it's unlikely she'll take $10,000 right away.  We'll try to get the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This tactic:

* **Establishes our target:** We want to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** We expect Alice to counter, giving us space to move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  Her response will tell us how much she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is negotiating, but we're still above our target price. We're close to John's price, but we have rounds to spare. Let's see if we can nudge Alice a bit lower before taking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Creating urgency:**  By giving a specific number and calling it a ""fair deal,"" we subtly increase the pressure on Alice.
* **Keeping John in mind:** We're getting close to our walk-away point. If Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two, we'll likely go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:**  Her language (""This is the lowest I'm willing to go"") suggests she won't budge much further.
* **Minimal potential savings:** Even if we could negotiate Alice down a little, it's unlikely to be a significant amount below John's $10,000 offer.
* **Time is a factor:** We've used five rounds already. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks missing out on John's guaranteed price. 

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
