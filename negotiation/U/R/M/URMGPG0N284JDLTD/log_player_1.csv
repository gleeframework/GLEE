Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good opportunity to close the deal. Bob's offer matches my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing him by further negotiation. It's better to secure the sale now."
