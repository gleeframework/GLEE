"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $8,500? It's still a fair price for the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
