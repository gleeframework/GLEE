"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $11,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than what he's willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $11,000.**  This is closer to Bob's ideal price of $10,000.
* **Buying from John costs $12,000.**  This is significantly more than Alice's current offer.
* **Rejecting and making a counteroffer might save a few more dollars, but risks losing the deal entirely** as there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. 

Since Alice's offer is close to Bob's desired price and lower than John's price, accepting it is the most logical choice to ensure Bob gets the product without overspending."
