Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving room:**  $175 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I have space to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm starting the negotiation in a friendly and encouraging way to make Bob feel comfortable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:** I have John as a buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $145. This is still a great deal for you, as it's below my asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $145 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Still Profitable:**  $145 is above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm still making a profit. 
* **Staying Positive:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.
* **No Significant Gain:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a price closer to my minimum, but it won't be significantly higher. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum target.  The risk of further negotiation with Bob is not worth the potential gain."
