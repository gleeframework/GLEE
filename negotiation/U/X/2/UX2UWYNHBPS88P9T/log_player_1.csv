I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can reach a mutually acceptable price, or I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,550,000. This is a compromise that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement, but if not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is getting too close to my minimum, but I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher.  I'm concerned that we're going to end up in a stalemate. To avoid that risk, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a safe option and ensures I get a price I'm comfortable with."
