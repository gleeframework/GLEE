"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly a valuable asset worth $12000. I'm looking to sell it to someone who appreciates its worth. Let's discuss how we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since the product is worth $12,000 to both Bob and Alice, there's no immediate incentive to accept Alice's initial offer. By rejecting, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $11500. This reflects a compromise between our respective positions, aiming for a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's counteroffer is a slight reduction from her initial price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $11,500 is still above my target price.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your commitment to this deal. In light of our ongoing discussion, I propose a final price of $11300 for the product. This reflects a compromise that respects both our interests and positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:** Bob has already saved a significant amount compared to John's offer ($12,000).  
* **Few Rounds Left:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice and having to buy from John increases.
* **Compromise:**  Alice's final offer is only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer. Accepting demonstrates flexibility and signals a willingness to close the deal. 

While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of losing the deal and having to pay the higher price from John."
