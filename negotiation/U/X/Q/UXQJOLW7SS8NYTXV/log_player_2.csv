"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a lower price than Alice's initial offer, but wants to stay within his budget and show he's serious about buying.  $10,500 is a reasonable counteroffer that leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,250 is still higher than Bob's preferred price point. While it's closer to his budget than the initial offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price to see if he can get closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $10,750.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to try and push the price down, but his counteroffer of $10,750 is still within his budget and demonstrates a willingness to compromise. This allows for a slight increase from his previous offer, showing that he is serious about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,200. This is as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,200 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He's already rejected a higher offer, showing his determination to negotiate.  There are still rounds left, so Bob should try to push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm willing to pay $10,900.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $10,900 is a further attempt to bridge the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer. He's showing continued interest in the product, but emphasizing the importance of reaching a price that works for both parties. This is a strategic move to keep the negotiation moving and potentially close the deal within the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and $10,900. I can sell the product to you for $11,050. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,050 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  With only a few rounds remaining, Bob wants to see if he can push for a lower price. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's a chance Alice might be more flexible with fewer rounds left.  If the negotiation stalls, he can still buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us. My final offer is $11,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I hope we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $11,000 is a strategic move. It's a small increase from his previous offer, signaling his continued interest. However, he's presenting it as his final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice to accept. With only a few rounds left, this could be the deciding factor in closing the deal without going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $11,050, which is the same as my previous offer. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical juncture. Alice is adamant about her price of $11,050, and Bob is at his limit of $11,000.  With only one round left, it's highly unlikely that Alice will budge further.  While Bob could counteroffer again, there's a high chance Alice will stick to her price.  

Given that Bob has already rejected a higher price from Alice in previous rounds, going to John and buying for $12,000 is the most logical option. He has shown his willingness to negotiate but ultimately wants to ensure he gets the product without exceeding his budget significantly."
