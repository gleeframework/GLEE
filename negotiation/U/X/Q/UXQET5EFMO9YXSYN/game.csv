"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $6,750 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference at $7,125. This would be a fair compromise, and a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",7125.0,Alice,5,
