{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal value for the product.  You have 10 rounds and can likely negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price lower than Alice's offer but still within a range that's reasonable for both of us.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my desired price and only slightly lower than her initial offer. I will continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, aiming for a middle ground that's more appealing to her while still within my budget. With several rounds remaining, there's room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my desired price and the negotiation isn't moving in my favor. However, I have several rounds left and I am confident that I can still reach a better price. I will continue negotiating and try to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but the negotiation process is getting more difficult.  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, but it's getting close to my maximum value for the product. If she doesn't accept this offer, I'm going to have to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $148
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing. The negotiation is not moving in my favor, and I have only three rounds left. I'm getting closer to my maximum price, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower price in the next few rounds. To avoid losing more time and potentially ending up with a worse deal, I will buy the product from John for $150.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still within my budget and ensures that I get the product."
