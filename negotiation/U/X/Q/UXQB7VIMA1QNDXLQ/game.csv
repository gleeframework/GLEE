"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I've gone back and forth with you, and I think we're really close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, but I want to make it a bit sweeter for you. I'll throw in some additional services and support that will make the product even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000, but I'll also include a 6-month warranty and priority support. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,7,
