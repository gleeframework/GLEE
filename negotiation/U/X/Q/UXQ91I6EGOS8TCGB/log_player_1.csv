Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he can bring the price down a little. 
* **Justification:**  While I haven't explicitly stated why my price is higher than Bob's perceived value, the phrase ""given its value"" hints at additional benefits or reasons why my price is justified. 
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning I'll list the product publicly, I subtly remind Bob he's not the only potential buyer, creating a sense of urgency. However, I avoid overtly pressuring him.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts the $15,000 offer.
2. **Open Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down towards his $12,000 valuation while staying above my minimum.
3. **Secure a Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I have John as a guaranteed backup at $12,000."
