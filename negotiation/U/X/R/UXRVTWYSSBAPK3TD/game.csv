"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
