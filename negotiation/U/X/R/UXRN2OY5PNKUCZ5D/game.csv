"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. Let's meet closer to the middle; how about $1,900,000? I believe this price reflects the true potential and returns you'll gain from it.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,500,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
