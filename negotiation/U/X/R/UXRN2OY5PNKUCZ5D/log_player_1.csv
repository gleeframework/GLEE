Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1,500,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate him higher, and waiting carries the risk he might lower his offer.  It's time to close the deal."
