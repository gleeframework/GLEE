"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  This offer is above my minimum value, and I believe it's within a range that Bob might consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's lower than what I initially offered.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,125,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still represents a good profit for me. I believe this price is within a reasonable range and could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit further in the next round.  There's still a chance to get a better price than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still within a range that provides a decent profit for me.  I believe this offer is close enough to Bob's last offer that it could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  At this point, I'm not confident that I can push Bob to a price that would be significantly better than what John is offering. To avoid risking a deal falling through completely, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
