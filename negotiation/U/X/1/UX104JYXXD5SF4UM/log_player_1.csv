{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your potential profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** You're getting $20 more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so he'll still get a good deal and likely accept.
* **It minimizes risk:** While you could try for a higher price, there's always a chance Bob might reject it. This offer is safe, guaranteeing you a profit and avoiding the need to sell to John."
