"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value it holds for me and the price I'm willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
