"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me at this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a good price, it's a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This allows for a fair deal for both of us and ensures I can continue to offer this exceptional product to others.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $850,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $850,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $880,000 to make this deal worthwhile. This is a fair price considering the significant value this product will bring to your business. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that $880,000 is a bit higher than I'd like, but I'm still interested in the product. Can you consider $860,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I value our ongoing discussions. While your offer of $860,000 is tempting, I need a price that better reflects the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $870,000. This price acknowledges your budget constraints while still ensuring a reasonable return for me. Let's finalize this deal at this price, I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",870000.0,Alice,7,
