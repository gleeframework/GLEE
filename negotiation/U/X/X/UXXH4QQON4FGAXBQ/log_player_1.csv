{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $8,000 minimum, so you're already in a good position.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** The price is lower than what Bob is willing to pay, increasing the chances of him accepting.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can adjust the price down if Bob counteroffers, or up if he's willing to pay more. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired price. You're aiming for as much as possible, and there's room to negotiate further.  

Let's see if you can get closer to your target by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $9,250? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain your position:** You're not accepting Bob's low offer, showing you're serious about getting a good price.
* **Meet halfway:** You're proposing a compromise, indicating you're willing to negotiate.
* **Stay above your minimum:**  $9,250 is still above your $8,000 floor, ensuring you make a profit. 

Let's see if this counteroffer will work."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $8,000. Would you consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still below your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer. Accepting this offer will allow you to secure a higher price than you could get from John, and it's likely you won't be able to get much more from Bob without risking him walking away completely."
