"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This is still more than you're willing to pay ($10,000 is your maximum).
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to buy from John for $10,000.** This is your maximum price, so you're guaranteed to get the product.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can still buy the product while staying within your budget."
