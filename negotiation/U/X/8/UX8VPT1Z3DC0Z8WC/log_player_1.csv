"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $180, knowing the product is worth less to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully allows me to secure a price closer to my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, this will be enough to get a deal done before I need to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on this deal.  I'll accept his offer."
