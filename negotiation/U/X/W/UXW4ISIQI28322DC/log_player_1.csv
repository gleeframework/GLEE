Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,250,000 is outside my budget. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

However, the value this product brings to the table, especially for a business like yours, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering the potential return on your investment."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,850,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

We're still significantly below my bottom line, and I need to push him further. It's too early to settle for his offer when I have John as a backup."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your firm stance, but I need you to understand this product's potential for your business.  It's not just about the value today, but the future growth it can unlock. I'm open to finding a middle ground, so I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I hear your enthusiasm for the product's future potential, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer.  If we can't find common ground at this price, I'll have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob is unlikely to move much further, and I'm running the risk of him walking away entirely.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer for $1,500,000."
