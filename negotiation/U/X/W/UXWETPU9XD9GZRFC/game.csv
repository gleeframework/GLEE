"Hey Alice, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget, I'm not quite ready to go down to $8,500. How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you coming down on your price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,750.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  That's a good compromise and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $8,250 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's compromise. How about we meet at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I wouldn't have to lower my price any further. ",8500.0,Alice,5,
