Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you (the minimum you'd sell for) and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Aiming for $2,000,000 gives you a significant potential profit margin.
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so you can afford to be firm in your negotiations with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with negotiation. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial proposal. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to lower your price to secure the deal."
