"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've put a lot of time and effort into, and I'm confident it could be a real asset for your business. I'm asking for $17,500 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss it further.",17500.0,Alice,1,
