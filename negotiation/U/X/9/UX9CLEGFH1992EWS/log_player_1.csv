Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,450,000. I believe this price is more in line with the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking below the product's value to you.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll significantly increase his offer. John provides a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
