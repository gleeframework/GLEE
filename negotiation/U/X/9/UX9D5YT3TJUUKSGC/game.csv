"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to move a little closer to your price, how about $760,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I see the value in the product.",760000.0,Bob,6,
