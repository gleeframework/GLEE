"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which is a steal for what it's worth!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is far too high. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is significantly higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $85 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?

``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $100 is cutting it really close to my bottom line. I'm willing to go down to $125, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is tempting, I'm still determined to save as much as possible. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $120.  This is already a significant discount, and I need to cover my costs. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $120 is still above my target price. With only 3 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price. I'm better off buying the product from John for $80, as it's within my budget and a much better deal."
