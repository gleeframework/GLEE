"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll be forced to purchase from John.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time.",110.0,Alice,5,
