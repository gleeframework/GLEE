Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! How about $1,200,000? It's my minimum price, and I believe the product's value justifies it.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but this is my final offer before I consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
