"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle one last time at $10,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
