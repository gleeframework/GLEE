Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Attractive to Bob:** $12,000 is still a decent price for Bob, as he values the product at $8,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** It gives you space to counter if Bob makes a lower offer. 
* **Option to go to John:** If Bob rejects, you can always turn to John and get your minimum value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I want for the product.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $9,500? It's a bit closer to your original offer, but still within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer before I decide to go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle one last time at $10,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a good investment for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
