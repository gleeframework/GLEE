Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $135? That's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down to $135, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum price of $150.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm confident that John will buy the product for $150.  It's not worth risking a lower price with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
