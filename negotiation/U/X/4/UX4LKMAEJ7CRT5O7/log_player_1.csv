I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves some room for negotiation. I believe there is a chance that Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it's likely he values the product more than $8,000. If he doesn't, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price."
