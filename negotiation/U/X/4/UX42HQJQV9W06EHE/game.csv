"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This price is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the value of this product, $900000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $875000. I'm willing to meet you at $885000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",885000.0,Alice,5,
