{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me a chance to see if he's truly interested and willing to pay more than his initial assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's clear Bob isn't willing to go higher. Rather than continue to negotiate and risk losing even more time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
