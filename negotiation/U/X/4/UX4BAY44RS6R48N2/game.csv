"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",95.0,Alice,3,
