"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be extremely valuable to you. I understand its worth to you is substantial, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  I'm asking for $1,150,000. This gives you a significant margin for profit while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
