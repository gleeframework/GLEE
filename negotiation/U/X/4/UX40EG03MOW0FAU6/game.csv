,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I'm happy to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $87.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $90. Would you be willing to go up to $89? It's a small step for you, and it would mean a lot to me.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87.50 and $89, which would be $88.25. Would you be willing to accept that?",88.25,Bob,6,
