"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20,000. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, as it's still a valuable asset to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $16,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you a price of $14,000, which is closer to your original offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product has. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's work towards a deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer you a price of $18,000, which is closer to my initial offer. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",18000.0,Alice,7,
