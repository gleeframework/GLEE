Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile at a price of $2,000,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer of $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price.  
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to hearing Bob's thoughts, suggesting a willingness to negotiate if needed.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer and that you have time for potential negotiation. 
* If you need a quick sale or are concerned about Bob rejecting the offer outright, a lower initial price might be more strategic."
