Round 5
Alice's offer:

``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While I might be able to get the price a little lower, $975,000 is a good deal and it's better to secure the product now rather than risk the negotiation going south in later rounds."
