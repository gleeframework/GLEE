This offer is a starting point. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm open to negotiation if Bob is willing to make a counteroffer.  I'll be watching for his response closely and will decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $800000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value."

Bob's offer:

I'm still holding out for a price closer to my target. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, the price gap is still too significant for me to accept his offer.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  It's better to have a certain profit than to risk a lower sale with Bob."
