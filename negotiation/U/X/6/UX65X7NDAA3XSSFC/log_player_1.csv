Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  $10,800 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me. How about $11,200?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 11200}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $11,200. How about $10,900? That's my best offer so far.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my goal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I still think we can do better. How about $10,600? I'm willing to meet you halfway.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600

This is getting frustrating.  Bob is not budging much, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a price that's worth my time.  I'm going to sell to John.  At least I'll get my minimum price and move on."
