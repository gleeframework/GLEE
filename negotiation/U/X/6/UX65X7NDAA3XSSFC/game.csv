"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,800 is a bit too low for me. How about $11,200?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $11,200. How about $10,900? That's my best offer so far.",10900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my goal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
