Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how much he values the product and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's less risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
