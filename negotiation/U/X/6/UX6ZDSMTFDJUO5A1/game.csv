"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested! While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $9,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",9750.0,Alice,5,
