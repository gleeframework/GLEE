Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $11,250?"", ""product_price"": 11250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering we both want to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $9,500.  Selling to John for $10,000 ensures a quick and guaranteed profit without further negotiation risk."
