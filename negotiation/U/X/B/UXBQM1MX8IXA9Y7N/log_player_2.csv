"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm offering it at $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's unlikely she'll come down to my desired price in just 10 rounds, especially since she values the product at $10,000.  Therefore, it's better to reject the offer and see if we can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,500. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  While I'm willing to pay up to $8,000, I'm starting a little higher to leave room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting my interest in the product to encourage her to consider my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a middle ground.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, $11,250 is still above my budget. It's better to continue negotiating and see if we can find a price closer to my target.  I'm confident that by offering a lower counteroffer, I can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $9,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering we both want to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,500, which is a good compromise from my initial offer of $8,500. This demonstrates my seriousness in buying the product while still staying within my budget. I'm also trying to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness by emphasizing the compromise I'm making."
