"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also allowing me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns about budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $975000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $975000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $825000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,6,
