"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to make a fair offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1100000? It's a compromise that I think we can both live with.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay.  Let's meet in the middle at $1050000. I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $1080000? It's still a compromise, but it's getting closer to where I need to be.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
