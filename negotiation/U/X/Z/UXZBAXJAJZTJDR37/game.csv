"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $2000000.

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget, and $2000000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits the product can bring to my business. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1500000 is a significant amount, I believe the product's potential value justifies a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price reflects the unique capabilities and benefits the product offers, and I'm confident it will prove to be a valuable investment for you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
