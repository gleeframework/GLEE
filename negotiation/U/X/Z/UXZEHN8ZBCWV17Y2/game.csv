"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away happy.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's be reasonable here - I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this.  I'm willing to drop my price one last time to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. If you're serious about buying, I'm sure we can agree on this. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, which is a fair price for me. Can we agree on that?",9800.0,Bob,8,
