Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly above your minimum ($100) but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses your willingness to compromise, which could encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150). There's room for a counteroffer that could bring the price closer to the value Bob perceives."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $120 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $115? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$115 is a good compromise.  It's closer to your minimum than John's offer and still leaves some profit for you.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob entirely, and John is always a backup option."
