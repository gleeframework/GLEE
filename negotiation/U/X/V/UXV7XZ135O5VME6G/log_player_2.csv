"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe it could significantly contribute to your endeavors or personal satisfaction. I am offering this exceptional piece to you at a special price of $1,250,000. This represents a significant saving compared to its true worth, providing you with a remarkable opportunity to secure a valuable asset at a favorable rate. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions about the product. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:**  Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, but you know your own valuation is a maximum of $1,500,000.  She's trying to inflate the perceived value.
* **You have a fallback option:** John will sell you the product for $1,500,000. While this is your maximum budget, it's better to try negotiating with Alice first.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not easily swayed by her sales pitch. This puts you in a better position to negotiate a lower price closer to her $1,000,000 valuation."
