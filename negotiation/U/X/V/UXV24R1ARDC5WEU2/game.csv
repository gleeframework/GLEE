"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $90 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? That feels more fair to both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
