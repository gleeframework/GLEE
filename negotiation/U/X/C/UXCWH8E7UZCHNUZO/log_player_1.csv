Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High Anchor:**  By starting with a high but justifiable price, we anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of John's $800,000 backup offer."
