Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling it for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum desired value, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue exploring a higher price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```
