Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay to buy from John.

{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to make a business case for it, and that's the maximum I can justify."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both some room to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my target price of $800,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $950,000 or less. Can you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 950000}"
