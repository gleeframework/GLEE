Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is more than your $120 minimum, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so he has room to negotiate a lower price. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and I'm still making a profit. It's better to accept his offer now than risk him walking away and selling to someone else or spending more time negotiating."
