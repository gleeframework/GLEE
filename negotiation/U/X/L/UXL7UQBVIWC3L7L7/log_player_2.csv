{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is getting closer to my ideal price. At this point, it's getting risky to continue negotiating as there are only a few rounds left. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
