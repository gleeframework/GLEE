"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower.  You have room to negotiate, and the goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $75?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $82 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price of $75. I'm willing to go a little higher, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target. There's still room to negotiate, and I want to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $78?  That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 78}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can do $80, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to pay closer to my initial target of $75, Alice has come down to $80, which is within my budget of $120.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal, and ultimately, I'm comfortable with the $80 price. It's a good deal, and I don't want to miss out on the product."
