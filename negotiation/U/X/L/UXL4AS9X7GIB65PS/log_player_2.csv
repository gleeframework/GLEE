"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this price reflects the value it brings to you, considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, you can still potentially save money by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing its value to me. However,  I'm aiming to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to let it go for $85? "", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I would like to propose an alternative. How about we meet in the middle at $90 for the product? This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  Accepting the offer at $90 saves you $10 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and you ultimately having to pay John $100 outweighs the potential of saving a few more dollars."
