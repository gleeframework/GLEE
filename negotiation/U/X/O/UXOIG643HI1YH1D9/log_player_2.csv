"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  A price of $9,000 is still too high.
* **There are 9 more rounds.**  This gives Bob ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's best to explore all options with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:** A significant counteroffer shows Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Midpoint approach:** $8,500 is halfway between Alice's offer of $9,000 and Bob's maximum of $10,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Alice some space to compromise while still allowing Bob to potentially save a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer.**  She's trying to push Bob back up in price.
* **There are still 7 rounds left.**  Bob should not give in to this pressure yet. 
* **The goal is to get as close to $8,000 as possible.**  This means Bob needs to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental counteroffer:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing flexibility but not caving to Alice's pressure.
* **Moving closer to Alice's potential acceptance point:** This counteroffer is closer to Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000) while still leaving room for her to meet Bob halfway. 
* **Maintaining negotiation momentum:**  Bob is staying active and showing Alice he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is again increasing her price.**  She's testing Bob's limits, but he should not give in.
* **Time is still on Bob's side.**  He has 5 rounds left to negotiate.
* **The target price is getting closer.**  $9,300 is just $1,300 above Bob's ideal price.  He's in a good position to push for a lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant increase:** Bob is inching closer to Alice's potential acceptance point, demonstrating flexibility without compromising too much.
* **Playing the waiting game:** Alice is likely getting more anxious as time runs out. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on her.
* **Preparing for a potential deal:** If Alice rejects this offer, she will likely make a counteroffer closer to Bob's desired price in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is continuing to increase her price.** This is a sign she might be feeling pressure as the rounds dwindle. 
* **The goal is still to save as much money as possible.**  $9,400 is a long way from Bob's desired price.
* **Three rounds left.** This is still enough time for Bob to negotiate a better deal.  He's in a good position to push for a lower offer and potentially close a deal near his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant increase:**  Bob is making a larger jump this time. This is a calculated risk, but with only three rounds left, he needs to show urgency.
* **Testing Alice's limits:**  This counteroffer is close to Alice's last offer.  If she rejects, she's very likely to make a concession in the next round. 
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:** If Alice accepts, Bob gets a good price. If she rejects, he has two more rounds to close the deal at a price closer to his desired target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Bob is determined to get a better price.
* **This is the penultimate round.** The pressure is on Alice to accept a lower offer.
* **Bob still has an option to buy from John.** This gives him leverage to push for a lower price from Alice in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  Bob needs to make a decisive counteroffer in this final round.
* **Small increase:**  This is a modest increase from Bob's last offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Pushing Alice to accept:**  She has two choices: accept and sell the product, or risk losing the deal entirely.  Alice has been increasing her price, and the pressure to sell is mounting.  

**Outcome:**

* If Alice accepts this offer, Bob gets a good price and saves money. 
* If Alice rejects, Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000.  While this is higher than Bob's ideal price, it's still within his budget and ensures he gets the product."
