"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $9,200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",9200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to me. While I'm interested, $9,200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $8,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. It's a great product, and I think it's worth it. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,200. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $9,200 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which would be $9,000. This is my final offer on that range. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,900. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9100.0,Alice,7,
