Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offers keep declining, and it seems unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable value. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $120, ensuring a guaranteed profit."
