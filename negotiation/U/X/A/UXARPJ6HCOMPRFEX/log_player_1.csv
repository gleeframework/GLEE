{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. I think it's worth $120, but I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This way I can potentially secure a good deal, while also showing flexibility. If he rejects, I can adjust the price down slightly if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I think I can find something similar for a bit less. How about if I offered $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to sell to John for $120, I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $110?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
