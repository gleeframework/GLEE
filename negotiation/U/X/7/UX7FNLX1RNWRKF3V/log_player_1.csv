{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm willing to negotiate, which encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive message is more likely to get a response and make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  That's my absolute max. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Even though Bob claims it's his ""absolute max"", there's a good chance he's willing to pay more, especially if I counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone makes the negotiation feel less confrontational."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  I really think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, it's still below it.
* **Possibility of better deal:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance I can get him to pay closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is safe:**  If I can't reach an agreement with Bob, I can always sell to John for $120, guaranteeing a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and encouraging Bob to agree by saying he'll be ""happy"" with the product."
