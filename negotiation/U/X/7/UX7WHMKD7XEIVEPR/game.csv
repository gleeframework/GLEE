"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly above what you offered, but it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a good compromise, considering we're both looking for a deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.  This price still offers you a good deal, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
