"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While your offer is closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is still significantly above what you offered, but it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still too high. We should keep trying to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a good compromise, considering we're both looking for a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue negotiating.  However, $900,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which reflects a significant concession on my part.  This price still offers you a good deal, while allowing me to achieve a reasonable outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're getting closer, but Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer a final price of $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. If you're willing to accept this, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
