"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still leaves me with a substantial profit. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer. While $925,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,4,
