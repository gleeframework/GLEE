{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $140 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $155.  This would still allow me to make a profit while ensuring you get a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 155} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $145? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $145 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, it makes more sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
