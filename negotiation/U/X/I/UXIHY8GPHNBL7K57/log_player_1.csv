"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** This opening price provides enough flexibility to negotiate and potentially find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **More negotiation potential:** I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $10,000, I'm aiming for a higher price and believe I can achieve it with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,500 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting that this price allows for a ""win-win"" scenario. 
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than he's offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're getting closer, and I believe I can push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm not desperate to sell and can use John's offer as a fallback if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is my final offer before I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my final offer before considering other options, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value to make him more likely to accept."
