"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $14,000, which I believe is fair considering its worth. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,500 is simply too low.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $12,000? That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",11500.0,Alice,5,
