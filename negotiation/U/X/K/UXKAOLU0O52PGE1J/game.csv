"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000.  This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a way to make this work!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",10750.0,Bob,4,
