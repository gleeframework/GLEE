{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,500 is better than my minimum, I think I can get closer to my target price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000.  This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $10,750 is a good price, considering my minimum and the fact that I have a backup offer from John. It's worth closing the deal now and securing a profit."
