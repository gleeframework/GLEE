"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $11,500 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I'm serious about buying, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $10,500 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Be polite and express interest:**  Bob remains interested but sets his price point clearly. 
* **Highlight your budget:**  Mentioning a budget emphasizes Bob's financial limitations, making the offer seem more genuine."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $11,000.  This still leaves room for you to get a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's find a way to make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the option open to try and get the price lower.  Since Bob can still buy the product from John for $12,000, there's no immediate urgency to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  That's a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show progress:** Bob acknowledges Alice's compromise and demonstrates that he's taking her offers seriously.
* **Split the difference:** Offering a middle ground is a common negotiation tactic that can signal a willingness to find a solution. 
* **Reinforce commitment:** Stating he's ready to finalize the purchase adds a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept."
