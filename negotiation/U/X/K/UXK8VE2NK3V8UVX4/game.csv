"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item that will bring you significant benefits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's still a good deal for you compared to its worth to you of $12,000.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value the product holds for me.  Let's try to close the deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $15,500. This is a good compromise, considering the value it brings to you and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you for less than its minimum value to me.",15500.0,Alice,5,
