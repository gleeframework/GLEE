{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Offering $12,000 gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures you're making a profit while leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling, but not desperate.

Remember, the key is to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is more than Bob's initial value, it's still below your minimum. You have room to negotiate and can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting his offer allows you to send a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11250}
