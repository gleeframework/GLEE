"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. Would you like to make an offer for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  It makes sense to reject and start the negotiation process by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While it's a step in the right direction, Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still outside my price range. I'm happy to go up to $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Bob is in a good position, as he can always buy from John for $8,000.  It makes sense to continue negotiating and try to push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise and allows you to make a decent profit. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to look elsewhere for the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While the negotiation is getting closer, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to come down further. With only 3 rounds remaining, Bob is better off buying the product from John at the guaranteed price of $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget."
