"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've got to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $135, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're getting a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to come down to $130, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so think carefully before making your next move.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $130, so I'll make a counteroffer of $127.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",127.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we've been dancing around this price for a while, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $127.50, but I'd like to throw in an extra incentive to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total value you'll get is $147.50. Is that a deal you can live with?",127.5,Alice,7,
