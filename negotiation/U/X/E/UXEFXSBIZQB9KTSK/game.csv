"Bob, I have a unique product I believe you would find valuable. Given its potential and the market, I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects its worth and the potential benefits you could realize.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits you mentioned.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer,  $1200000 doesn't fully reflect the unique value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This price still reflects the product's worth and the potential benefits you can reap.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1200000, which is the price I was willing to pay in my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
