Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $10,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer it below that price for him to even consider it.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering it at $9,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still giving Alice a significant profit. 
* **Backup Option:** Alice has the security of John's offer, ensuring she won't be forced to accept anything below $10,000."
