Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum value of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I could keep negotiating, Bob has now offered my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from him in the next round, and there's always the risk that he'll walk away.  It's better to secure the deal now and avoid potential future complications."
