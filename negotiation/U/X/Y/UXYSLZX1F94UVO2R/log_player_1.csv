"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, even considering the significant profit you stand to make."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,800,000 vs. $800,000) and our own minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""significant profit"" potential for Bob, aiming to justify the high initial price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting high, we establish a strong position and give ourselves leverage in subsequent rounds. Even if Bob rejects the offer, we can gradually lower the price while still aiming for a price above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, considering my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate.  We're in round 2 of 10, and Bob's counter shows a willingness to move significantly from his initial valuation.  We'll aim to bring the price closer to $1,500,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market.  However, the value of this product truly is unique.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're lowering our price by $200,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to negotiate. This is a significant drop, but we're still aiming high. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We're continuing to reinforce the product's value and potential profitability for Bob. By tying the price to his return on investment, we're strengthening our position.
* **Leaving Room:**  While we've made a concession, we're still leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered Alice's latest offer, and while it's an improvement, I still feel there's room for negotiation given my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this figure is closer to what we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating strong interest. However, we're still significantly above our minimum selling price. We'll hold firm for now to gauge his willingness to move closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's find a way to get this done.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  I believe this reflects the true value while acknowledging your position."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're making a smaller concession this round ($50,000), signaling that we're getting closer to our desired price point. This offer is slightly above the midpoint between his offer ($1,400,000) and our previous ask ($1,600,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By saying ""Let's find a way to get this done,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency without seeming desperate. 
* **Final Stretch:** With five rounds remaining, we're positioning ourselves for a final push towards our target price. We want to see if Bob is willing to bridge the remaining gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Achieved:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets our goal of exceeding our minimum price ($1,000,000) and securing a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Success:**  We've successfully negotiated Bob up from his initial offer of $1,200,000, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy.
* **Minimal Risk:** Accepting now eliminates the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds or of the negotiation reaching an impasse."
