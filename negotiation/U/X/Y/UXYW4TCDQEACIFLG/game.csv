"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're looking to stay within a budget of $80, but I'm afraid I can't go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $100, which is the lowest I can go.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $80. Could we possibly find a middle ground?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, I've already adjusted my price to $100, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, though - I'll include a complimentary accessory that's normally worth $20. This is the best I can do, so I hope you'll consider it.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget and offering the bonus accessory. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $80. I wonder if there's any way we could reach an agreement that would allow me to purchase the product while staying true to my budget.",80.0,Bob,6,
