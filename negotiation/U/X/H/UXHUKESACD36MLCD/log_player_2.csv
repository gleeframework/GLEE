"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above your desired price point of $8,000. You should try to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $11,000, but it still leaves room for some negotiation. You're aiming for a price that's closer to your $8,000 target, but still potentially attractive to Alice, as it's more than half-way to her desired price of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than your desired price, but it's a reasonable compromise. It's likely that further negotiation might only lead to a small price reduction, and you risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the product to another buyer."
