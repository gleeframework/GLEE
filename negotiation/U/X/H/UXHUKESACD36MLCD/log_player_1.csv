Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 but still allows me to earn a decent profit. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $9,000. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than the $11,000 I initially offered. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's initial counteroffer was significantly lower."
