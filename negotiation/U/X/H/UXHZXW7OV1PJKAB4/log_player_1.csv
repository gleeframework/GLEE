This offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  It signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but I also value the product highly."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below what I want for the product. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point with another counteroffer."
