"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,
