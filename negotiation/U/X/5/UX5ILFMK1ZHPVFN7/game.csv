"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,800. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to push the price down, but $9,800 is simply not acceptable. I'm willing to meet you halfway again - how about $10,400? This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to close this deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,300.  This is a fair price, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal.",10300.0,Alice,7,
