"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit outside my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet halfway again and try $12,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a compromise from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already willing to sell it to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $13,500 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  Let's get this done.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $12,750, which is a good compromise from both of our last offers. Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.",12750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,750. I'm willing to meet you at $13,200, which is a small increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",13200.0,Alice,9,
