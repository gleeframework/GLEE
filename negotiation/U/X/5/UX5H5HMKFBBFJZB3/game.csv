"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a good offer, it's unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway, I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but that's the highest I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",13500.0,Bob,4,
