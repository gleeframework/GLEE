"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you believe the product is worth a lot, but I'm still not convinced that $1,325,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
