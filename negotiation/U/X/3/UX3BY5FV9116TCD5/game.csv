"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $100. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers, say $80? That feels like a fair price to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to go a bit lower, though. How about $90? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",90.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to budge a little. Would you consider $85? That's the highest I can go.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $92? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",92.0,Alice,7,
