"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay a maximum of $100, and her offer is $95.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can try to get a better price. 
* **John is a backup option.** Knowing you can buy from John for $100 gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  By dropping the price to $85, you show Alice you're serious about getting a deal, but you're still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Be polite and encouraging:** A friendly tone keeps the negotiation going smoothly.
* **Focus on the value:**  You're emphasizing the value of the product to you, not just trying to squeeze the lowest price.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  $85 is still a profitable deal for Alice, as she values the product at $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's closer to your ideal price, $90 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further.
* **John remains a viable option.** The fact that you can buy from John for $100 provides you with a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $85.  Would you be willing to come down to $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintain your position:**  You've already shown Alice you're serious about getting a good deal.  You're not backing down from your original offer.
* **Offer a compromise:**  $87.50 is a midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating willingness to find common ground. 
* **Emphasize fairness:**  By suggesting it's ""fair for both of us,"" you're trying to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  This counteroffer is likely to be acceptable to Alice, but if she rejects it, you still have more rounds to continue the negotiation."
