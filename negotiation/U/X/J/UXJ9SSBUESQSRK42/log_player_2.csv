"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $180. This is far above Bob's limit. Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

While Alice's offer is lower than her original price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower.  It's worth exploring if he can get closer to his desired price with another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to let this product go for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell it to you for $145, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's still a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.

Bob has already offered his maximum price, and Alice has countered with a price higher than his budget. At this point, it is more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $120. This ensures that he gets the product within his budget without further negotiation."
