You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You have no information about the value of the product to Alice, so you cannot determine if Alice's offer is a good deal or not.  Since you're willing to pay $12,000 from John, there's no reason to risk negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the product for your maximum price."
