"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer while ensuring I don't give it away too cheaply."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering $95, which is still above Bob's value but closer to his offer. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my goal of getting as close to $120 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $90? That would be a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to go down to $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

I'm offering $92, which is a compromise but still above my minimum. I'm aiming for a quick close as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $92 is a bit high. Can you try to meet me at $88? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a bit closer to my minimum price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle for $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a willingness to compromise and could potentially lead to a quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $90 is a bit high. Can you try to meet me at $87? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Bob has consistently refused to budge on his price. While I could continue trying to negotiate with him, it's becoming increasingly clear that we won't reach a mutually acceptable price. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids further time wasted in negotiations."
