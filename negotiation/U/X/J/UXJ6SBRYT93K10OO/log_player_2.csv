"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a great deal, but there's always the potential to get it even lower. Since I have 10 rounds, I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to start by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This will show her that I'm serious about negotiating, and hopefully open up room for a compromise.  $50 is a decent starting point, but I'm prepared to go even lower if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $60 is a significant improvement from her first offer and is within my budget.  While I could potentially negotiate lower, there's a risk that she'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up paying more.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and securing the product for a good price."
