"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer sets a strong baseline and allows me to see how much value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm reducing my offer by $200,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. $950,000 is a significant profit and close enough to my desired price. I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
