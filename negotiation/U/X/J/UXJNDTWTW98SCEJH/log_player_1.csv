"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm asking $120 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90, as I mentioned in my previous message. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I can come down a bit from my initial price. How about $105?  That's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $105 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $97.50 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still within the negotiation and haven't reached my desired price yet. I'm going to see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $102.50. This is a good deal for both of us, and it's still a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think $102.50 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $99. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $99. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $99
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is $99, which is just below my minimum value of $100, but it's still a good deal considering we have only four rounds left. It's also likely that we won't get a better offer in the next round. I'm going to accept the offer."
