Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $9000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
