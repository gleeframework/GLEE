"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $1200000 is still quite a bit below what I believe the product is worth.  To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
