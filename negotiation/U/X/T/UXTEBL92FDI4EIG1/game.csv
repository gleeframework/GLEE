"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me. Let me know if you're open to that.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your perspective, but this product is truly valuable and holds significant worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $1,200,000? This reflects a compromise on both our parts, and ensures a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
