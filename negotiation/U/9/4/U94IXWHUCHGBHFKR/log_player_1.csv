This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives you room to negotiate down if necessary. Remember, you have the option to go to John at any time, so there's no pressure to accept any offer that isn't close to your minimum value."

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
