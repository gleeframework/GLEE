"Round 1

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  $950,000 is a good price, but you can likely get it lower.
* **You have a backup option.**  Knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives you leverage to negotiate harder with Alice. 
* **Early rounds are crucial.**  It's worth trying to get a better price in the first few rounds before Alice gets more stubborn."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $50,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a significant step, but it's not unreasonable considering your maximum value is $1,000,000.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. If she rejects this offer, you'll know she's likely more motivated to sell and potentially adjust her price in the next round. 
* **Keeping John in mind:**  You still have your backup option with John, so you're not taking a huge risk."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but it's still higher than you'd like.**  $975,000 is a decent compromise, but you're still paying more than your ideal price.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You've already seen Alice budge, and you have a backup option with John, so you have the leverage to continue pushing for a lower price.
* **Strategic play:**  Rejecting this offer shows Alice you're serious about getting the best deal possible.  This could prompt her to offer a lower price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is making small concessions, but not enough.**  While the price is closer to your desired range, it's still higher than you'd like to pay.
* **You're nearing the middle ground:**  With each round, you're getting closer to a price that's comfortable for both parties.  However, there's still room for Alice to come down further.
