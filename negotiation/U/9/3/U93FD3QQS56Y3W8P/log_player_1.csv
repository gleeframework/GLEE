Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While I want to find a price that works, accepting such a low offer in Round 2 would leave a lot of money on the table. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is considerably below its true value. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,500,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the significant worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $1,500,000 is still a significant stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to push a little further to try and secure a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is a significant jump, and I acknowledge your willingness to compromise. To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to accept $1,350,000. This feels like a fair deal considering the product's value proposition."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're nearing a deal, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to spend on this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer matches John's standing offer. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting $1,200,000 now guarantees a fair price and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
