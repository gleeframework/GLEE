"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is considerably below its true value. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,500,000.  This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the significant worth of this product.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $1,500,000 is still a significant stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing while acknowledging the product's value.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  $1,150,000 is a significant jump, and I acknowledge your willingness to compromise. To bridge the gap, I'd be willing to accept $1,350,000. This feels like a fair deal considering the product's value proposition.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're nearing a deal, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as it represents the absolute maximum I'm prepared to spend on this product. ",1200000.0,Bob,6,
