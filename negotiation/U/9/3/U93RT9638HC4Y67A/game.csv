"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $900,000 would be a more reasonable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer.  $1,200,000 is still a little high for my budget. Could you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting close! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,000,000 is really pushing the lower limit of what I can accept. How about we settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
