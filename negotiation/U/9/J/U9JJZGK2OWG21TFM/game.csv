"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fairer point to continue the conversation.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting a good balance between its value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've been flexible, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  So, I'm willing to make one more move: $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair given the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are close and I do believe this product would be beneficial for me. However, $1,250,000 is pushing my absolute limit. I can offer you $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant investment for me, and I hope you see it as a sign of my genuine interest in this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
