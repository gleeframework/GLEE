"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Alice starts high to establish a strong negotiating position. Offering a price significantly above both her minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Alice's openness to discussion. 
* **Gauging interest:** This first offer is a way to gauge Bob's level of interest and get him invested in the negotiation process. 
 
Alice understands she has the fallback option of John ($1,200,000) but aims to maximize her profit with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While his counteroffer was expected, accepting would mean a substantial loss for Alice. She knows she has a backup offer from John at $1,200,000, but it's still early in the negotiation. 

Alice will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to steer the negotiation closer to her desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fairer point to continue the conversation."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Bridge:** Alice acknowledges Bob's counteroffer to maintain a positive atmosphere but firmly reiterates that his price is too low. 
* **Justify the Value:** She emphasizes the product's inherent worth to justify her higher price.
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** Alice makes a substantial reduction from her initial offer ($1,600,000 to $1,400,000) to show flexibility and encourage Bob's engagement. However, she remains well above both her minimum and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Call to Action:**  She frames the new price as a starting point for further discussion, encouraging Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting a good balance between its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, $900,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Alice needs to signal that she's willing to walk away if a fair price isn't reached. However, there's still room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer. 

Alice will continue the negotiation, but her next counteroffer will need to be firm to guide Bob closer to her target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've been flexible, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  So, I'm willing to make one more move: $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair given the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Alice makes it clear that she has alternative options and is not willing to negotiate endlessly. She uses a firm yet respectful tone to convey the seriousness of her position.
* **Justification and Transparency:** She justifies her position by mentioning the other buyer, adding credibility to her stance without revealing the specific amount. 
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By explicitly stating this is her final offer, Alice introduces a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make his decision.
* **Slight Concession with Strategic Positioning:**  The offer of $1,250,000 is a slight concession from her previous offer but still positions her above her absolute minimum, leaving room for a potential small win for Bob if he accepts.

This approach aims to either bring Bob closer to Alice's acceptable range or prompt him to reveal his final decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are close and I do believe this product would be beneficial for me. However, $1,250,000 is pushing my absolute limit. I can offer you $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant investment for me, and I hope you see it as a sign of my genuine interest in this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing commitment and has increased his offer, his ""final"" offer of $975,000 is still significantly below Alice's minimum of $1,200,000.  

Here's why selling to John is the best option now:

* **Time:**  There are only a few rounds left. Continuing the negotiation with Bob might not yield a significant increase in his offer, especially since he stated it as his final one.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000. Accepting Bob's offer means a loss of $225,000 compared to John's deal.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob might be unwilling to budge further, particularly after stating his ""final"" offer.

While there's a slight chance Bob might reconsider, the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John outweighs the potential for a marginally better deal with Bob."
