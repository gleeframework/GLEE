Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its value. How about we consider $1,400,000? This feels like a fairer point to continue the conversation.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've been flexible, but we're still quite far apart.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  So, I'm willing to make one more move: $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's more than fair given the product's value.
