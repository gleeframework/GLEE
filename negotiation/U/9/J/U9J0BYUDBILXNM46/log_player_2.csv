"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  Since his maximum budget is $12,000, there's room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Since Bob has a budget of $12,000, he can afford to continue negotiating. There's still potential for a better deal.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $10,750.  This is closer to my budget, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $10,875?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $10,875.  This price is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and is lower than the $11,000 Alice offered in the previous round.  It is also a significant improvement over Bob's initial counteroffer of $10,500. 

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to get an even lower price, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers or that the negotiation will drag on.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision, as it secures a good deal within Bob's budget."
