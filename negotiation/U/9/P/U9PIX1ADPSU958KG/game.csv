"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a good price, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for it. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I think the product is worth it, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle. How about we try $130 again?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would you be willing to meet me at $125 again? I'm willing to make a final offer, and if you can't accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",125.0,Bob,6,
