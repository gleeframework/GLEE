Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is top-of-the-line, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $19,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $19,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Explanation: While I could push for more, accepting $19,000 is a good deal at this point. It's significantly more than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob seems firm on his valuation. It's better to secure a solid profit now than risk him walking away in later rounds."
