"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $20000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8000.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
