Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a price slightly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,""  you create a sense of urgency and subtly imply the product is worth the asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is suggestive, not demanding.  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product at a price he might find acceptable.  If he rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John at your minimum price."
