This offer starts with a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring that you're still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
