"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profits. 
* **Attractive but Not Outrageous:** $1,200,000 is significantly less than the product's worth to Bob, making it a potentially appealing offer.
* **Open Communication:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aiming Higher:**  While $1,000,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation is Key:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob again to justify the price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** By suggesting a compromise, I'm keeping the negotiation open and allowing for potential further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's find common ground and get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm not yet at the point where I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a deal and am willing to continue negotiating.
* **Exploring Higher Offers:** There's still potential for Bob to come closer to my desired price range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, but I believe there's a higher chance of securing a better deal with Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm continuing to offer a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's latest offer and my previous one.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using positive language like ""happy"" and ""fair"" to create a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm hinting at the possibility of a deal getting closer by saying ""Let's get this done."""
