"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial asking price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's find common ground and get this done.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $1,050,000 is a good offer, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
