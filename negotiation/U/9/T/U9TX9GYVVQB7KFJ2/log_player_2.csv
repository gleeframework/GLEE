"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,500. I know it's a great deal for you, as you've expressed it's worth that much to you.  This price allows me to get a bit more than what I would get from another buyer, but it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice's offer is not outrageous, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since he can get the product from John for $15,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the better choice."
