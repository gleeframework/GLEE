"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product. However, $1,150,000 is a bit high for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value this product brings warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000.  This offer reflects a balance between its worth and my desire to see it in your capable hands.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good value for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
