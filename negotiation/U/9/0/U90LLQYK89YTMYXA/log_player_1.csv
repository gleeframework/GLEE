Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. After evaluating its potential value to my business, I am proposing a purchase price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your specific needs. I'm confident it can dramatically impact your operations, and I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer reflecting its worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. While I recognize the product's potential benefits, I am unable to meet the price you've offered. I would like to propose a price of $1,650,000, which I believe strikes a balance between the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is now getting closer to our minimum acceptable price. We are still in a strong position to negotiate as we have John as a backup option.  We'll counter-offer again to try and push the price higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, your understanding of the product's value is getting closer.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to consider $1,800,000. This price reflects the significant ROI you'll see from implementing this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's potential impact on our business, I would like to propose a final price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While we could likely push Bob a bit further, accepting $1,750,000 is a significant gain over John's offer of $1,500,000. It represents a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
