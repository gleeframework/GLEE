Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd love!  I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is above your minimum but leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also shows that you value Bob as a potential buyer and are willing to work with him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  It's worth exploring if you can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise and is very close to your desired price. It's a good deal for you and likely the best you can get from Bob.  It's also higher than the $80 you'd get from John, making this the optimal choice."
