"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and also establishes a starting point for the conversation.  I'm confident that Bob will counter-offer, giving us a chance to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $105, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target, but closer to Bob's offer this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering the price to $100, my absolute minimum, to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but won't go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not convinced Bob will budge much further.  I've already reached my minimum price and the negotiation is getting tense.  Selling to John for $100 is the safest option, guaranteeing I reach my minimum.  I'll avoid further negotiation and go with the certainty of John's deal."
