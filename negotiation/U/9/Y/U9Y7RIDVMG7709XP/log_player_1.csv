Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need a price that works for me. How about $750,000?  This is a fair offer considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still significantly below both our desired price and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $850,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
