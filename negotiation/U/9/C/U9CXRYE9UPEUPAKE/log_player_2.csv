"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1400000.  This price allows you a significant margin while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject the offer. If I buy from Alice at $1,400,000, I will make a profit of $100,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,400,000). However, if I reject the offer and buy from John at $1,500,000, I will make a profit of $0 ($1,500,000 - $1,500,000). Since $0 is greater than $100,000, it is better for me to reject the offer and buy from John.
