Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's in great condition and you know it's worth a lot to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a positive tone, highlighting the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to pay more than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is more than Bob initially valued the product, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me the opportunity to counter with a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $105 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $102.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $102.5 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing the sale entirely. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting a lower offer or losing the sale to another buyer."
