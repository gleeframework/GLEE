"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my price range. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll reconsider.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $8,500, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9,800. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,800 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can reach a deal here.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I can offer it to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not interested, I'm happy to discuss further, but I'm not willing to go lower.",10000.0,Alice,7,
