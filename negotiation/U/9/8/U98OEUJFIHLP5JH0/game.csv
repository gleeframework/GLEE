"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and more than my minimum. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $850,000 for the product? I hope this proposal works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not there yet. How about $950,000? This would still be a significant savings for you compared to what the product is worth to you, and I would be happy to close the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
