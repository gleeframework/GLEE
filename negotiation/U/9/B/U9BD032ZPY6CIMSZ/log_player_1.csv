Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000.  This is a great opportunity to acquire it at a price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Knowing Bob's valuation is $12,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the higher end.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the higher price without explicitly revealing your minimum. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he's completely turned off, you haven't lost anything, as John provides a safety net. If Bob counter-offers, you can negotiate down towards your minimum while still aiming for the best possible deal."
