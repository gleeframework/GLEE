Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a profit for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Why not other prices?**

* **$120 or higher:**  Bob is unlikely to accept a price equal to or higher than what the product is worth to him.
* **$100:** This is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, but Alice has a guaranteed offer of $120 from John, so this would be selling at a loss. 
* **Prices between $101-$118:** While these prices could potentially result in a sale, they leave potential profit on the table."
