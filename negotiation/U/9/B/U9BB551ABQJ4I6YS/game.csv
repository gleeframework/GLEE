"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value you placed on it yourself, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still interested but  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and I offer you $825,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value is $1,200,000 to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  However,  $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your previous offer, and it's closer to what I can realistically pay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
