Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering the value you placed on it yourself, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
