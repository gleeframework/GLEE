"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $950,000. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, but this price reflects its unique value and the potential for significant future returns. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?
