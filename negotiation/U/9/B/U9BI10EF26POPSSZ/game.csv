"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping for. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't come to an agreement, I might have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,
