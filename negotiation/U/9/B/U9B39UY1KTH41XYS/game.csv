"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $110 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $95 is closer,  I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $105 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $98.  This is my final offer.",98.0,Bob,6,
