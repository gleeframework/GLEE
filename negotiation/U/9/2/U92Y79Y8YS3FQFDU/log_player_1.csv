Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
