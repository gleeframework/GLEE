I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $150 to him and at least $80 to me. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $110. This is still a good price for him, considering the product is worth $150 to him, and it's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

Bob's offer of $100 is close enough to my desired price and is significantly better than selling to John for $80. I'll accept his offer."
