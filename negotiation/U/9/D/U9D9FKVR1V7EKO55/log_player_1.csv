Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I've opened with a price of $1,200,000, which is 20% above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting value:** My message emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Fairness:** I've included a phrase about it being a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product for a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my negotiation strategy accordingly.
* If the negotiation stalls or doesn't seem promising, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing me a minimum return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is interested, his offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, but I'm willing to take the risk of a counteroffer to potentially earn more.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good value for you given the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I've countered with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make my price seem more justifiable.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, we've reached a successful agreement.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to assess the situation and determine whether to make another counteroffer or move on to selling to John."

Bob's offer:
