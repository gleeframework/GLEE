"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good value for you given the product's potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking for a price that works for you, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. Can we make a deal at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
