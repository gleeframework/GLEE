The product is worth no more than $80 to me, so I cannot accept Alice's offer of $180.  I will reject and see if I can negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is still above my budget. I've made several counteroffers, but she hasn't been willing to negotiate down to a reasonable price.  To avoid further haggling, I'll purchase the product from John for $80."
