"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to. While I appreciate your offer, $90 is unfortunately not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $105?  This would still be a good deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. $100 is a bit closer, but I still need to make a profit.  How about $110?  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer waiting. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another buyer waiting, but I'm not willing to go above $100. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you reconsider and meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,6,
