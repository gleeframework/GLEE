"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of the product, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often involves starting with a lower offer than your true goal. This gives you room to move up and still reach a price that works for you.
* **Significantly Below Alice's Offer:** This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating and not just accepting her initial price.
* **Still Above Your Walk-Away Price:** Even if Alice accepts this offer, you're getting a great deal compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $975,000 is still significantly above your target price and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still seven rounds left, indicating there's likely room for further negotiation. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, you're signaling to Alice that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This might encourage her to make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  You're holding firm at your walk-away price, making it clear that this is the best you're willing to do. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating it's your final offer, you add a level of urgency and encourage Alice to make a decision.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Psychology:** This framing can be persuasive, even though it's based on your target price, not the actual midpoint of your offers. 

Now, it's up to Alice. She might accept your offer, counter with a price closer to yours, or hold firm. You've put yourself in a good position by setting a clear limit while still leaving room for a potential deal."
