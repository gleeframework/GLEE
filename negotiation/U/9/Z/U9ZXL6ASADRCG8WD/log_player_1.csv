This offer is a starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob's likely to counteroffer, and I'll be ready to negotiate further based on his response.  The goal is to get as close to $1,500,000 as possible without risking the deal by pushing too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept,  I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

I'm raising the price slightly from my previous offer.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a price closer to my value, but it's still a reasonable compromise.  I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While I'd like more, there's a risk that he'll walk away completely if I continue to push.  It's better to secure a deal at $1,350,000, rather than potentially lose the deal and end up with just $1,200,000 from John."
