"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This sets a strong starting point and allows for potential negotiation. I'm aware that this is a significant amount, but it's important to aim high initially to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is getting closer to my desired price point.  While I'd ideally get more, accepting this offer is a good compromise.  It's  above my minimum and I'm running out of rounds to negotiate further."
