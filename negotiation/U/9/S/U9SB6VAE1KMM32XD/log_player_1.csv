``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, leaving room for negotiation but still demonstrating the value I place on the product.  I'll be watching Bob's reaction closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it still keeps the price above my minimum and shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I won't go any lower. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum. I'm not willing to go lower than that, and I don't want to keep haggling.  John is a sure thing, so I'm going to sell to him."
