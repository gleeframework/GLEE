"Alice, thanks for the offer. $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $9,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps us close to my budget.",10500.0,Bob,4,
