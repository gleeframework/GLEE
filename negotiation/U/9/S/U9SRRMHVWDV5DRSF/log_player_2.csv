Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,250, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice's offer is only $250 away from John's price.  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential saving isn't worth the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing.  It's a good deal!"
