"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. How about we start at $700,000 and see where we go from there?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'll meet you halfway between $820,000 and $760,000, so I'll offer $890,000. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
