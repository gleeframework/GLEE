{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also giving Bob a reason to accept by emphasizing the value of the product. 

I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm willing to negotiate a bit to get the best possible price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by reducing my price from $12,000 to $11,500.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal. However, I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept any offer below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've reached a point where I'm confident that I can get a better price from John.  I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000 and move on."
