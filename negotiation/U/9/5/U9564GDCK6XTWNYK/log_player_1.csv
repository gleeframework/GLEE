Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $140 is above your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It's important to communicate clearly and make your offer easy to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still a profit for Alice, it's only slightly above her minimum.  By rejecting Bob's offer, Alice can:

* **Potentially get a better price:** She can counteroffer and try to get closer to her desired price of $140.
* **Assess Bob's commitment:**  Bob's willingness to counteroffer shows he's interested. Seeing how far he's willing to go can help Alice determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $135. How about $132? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit:**  $132 is still a good profit for Alice, exceeding her minimum of $120.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Alice could try to push for $135 again, there's a risk Bob will walk away.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on and consume more time and energy.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale with a decent profit."
