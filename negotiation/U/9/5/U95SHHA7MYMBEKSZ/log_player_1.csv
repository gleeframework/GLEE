Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also below my minimum value, giving me room to negotiate down if needed.  I'll be ready to counter if Bob rejects and will monitor the situation to see if I need to switch to John if it seems negotiations with Bob will stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I need to get closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer to try and get closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer but is a step closer to my desired price point. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
