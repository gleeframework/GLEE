I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to engage in negotiations, and I can potentially earn more than the $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise given Bob's low offer. I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to agree to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to try one more time with a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping that Bob is close enough to my desired price that he'll accept.  If he rejects this offer, I'll go with John and sell for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum requirements.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000."
