"I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,92.0
"I can see you're a serious buyer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go.",92.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $88. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $88 and $92, so how about $90? I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal",90.0,Alice,5,,
