"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also being reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to save some more, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $795,000 is a good deal considering your $1,500,000 maximum."
