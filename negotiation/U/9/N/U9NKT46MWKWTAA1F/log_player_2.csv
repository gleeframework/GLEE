(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  You want to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
``` 

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $4,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still leaves room for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $5,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite high.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. I'm hoping we can settle somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down a bit, and while I'd prefer a lower price,  $5,200 is a good deal compared to what John is offering. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential for failure."
