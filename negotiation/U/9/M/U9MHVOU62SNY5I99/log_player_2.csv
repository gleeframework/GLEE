"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $135.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a decent price, you can likely get it for cheaper. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you consider $125? "", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than $135, it's still above your target of $120.  You're still aiming to save as much as possible and can likely push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to try and get closer to your target price."
