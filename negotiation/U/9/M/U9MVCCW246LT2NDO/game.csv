"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $170 is quite a drop.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $125?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $125 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate further.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse. I value this product and can't go as low as $80.  My final offer is $110. This is a very fair price, take it or leave it. ",110.0,Alice,5,
