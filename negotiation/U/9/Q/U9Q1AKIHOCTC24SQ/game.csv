"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about we try $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it offers. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,800 is still a little too low for me. Considering the value of this product and the benefits it can bring, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",10200.0,Alice,7,
