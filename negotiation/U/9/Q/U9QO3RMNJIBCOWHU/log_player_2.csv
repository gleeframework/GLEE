"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $900,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to spend closer to $800,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what he can get from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
