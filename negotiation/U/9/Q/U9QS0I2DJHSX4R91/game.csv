"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective,  $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  It's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your new price of $1,400,000.
