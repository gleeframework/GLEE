Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $1,400,000, I have room to negotiate down if Bob counters with a lower price, while still ensuring I get a good deal. 
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I can always choose to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my preferred target. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I believe I can still get a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range, potentially leading to a better outcome.
* **Avoiding ""Selling Low"":** Selling for $1,350,000 would be a good deal for Bob, but I want to maximize my profit if possible.

**Next Round Strategy:**

I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, perhaps $1,400,000.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective,  $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  It's a fair offer that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a better price for myself.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I am not dropping my price significantly, showing that I'm not desperate to sell. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  The message highlights the benefit for both of us, which could encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Preparing for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.  I'm keeping my options open while still trying to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your new price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,375,000. This price still allows me to consider the product valuable while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 below my previous counteroffer. This is a small enough difference that it's not worth risking further negotiation.
* **Risk of Loss:**  If I reject Bob's offer and he walks away, I might be forced to sell to John for $1,500,000. This is a worse outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiating further might take more time, and I'm not sure if I can get a significantly better price.  The time spent negotiating could be better used elsewhere.

**Conclusion:**  While $1,375,000 is not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that secures a sale and avoids the risk of getting a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
