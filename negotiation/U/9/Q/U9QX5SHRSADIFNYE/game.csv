"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, though.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I have another option for a similar product at that price. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $1300000 is closer, but still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1100000.  This represents a significant compromise from my original offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
