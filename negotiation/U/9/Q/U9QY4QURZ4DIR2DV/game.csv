"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value to you and the value to me. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering the value to both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,150,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $1,140,000. This is the best I can do.
