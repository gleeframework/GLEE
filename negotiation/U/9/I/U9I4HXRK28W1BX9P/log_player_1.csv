``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$16,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing number for Bob, while still being reasonably close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum value and is significantly higher than what John is offering. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
