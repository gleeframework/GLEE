It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to an initial price.  A counteroffer gives you a chance to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is well below her initial offer but still leaves room for further bargaining if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hoping to get it lower.  I'll try another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the last round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying, but still keeping it below her current offer. This should keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming down in price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price. This is likely my final counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, but I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  Buying from John ensures I get the product for a price I'm comfortable with."
