"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down to $700,000. I'm ready to make a deal, but I can't go that high. I'm willing to pay $600,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering our initial discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $650,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial interest. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",650000.0,Alice,3,
