Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. Let me know your thoughts â€“ this offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I have another interested buyer."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes your potential profit.
* **Value Justification:** While the price is high, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's value to Bob (""exceed your expectations"") might make him more amenable. 
* **Deadline Pressure:**  Adding a deadline creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Subtly mentioning John ensures Bob knows you're not desperate and have other options, strengthening your position. 

**Important:** This is just one approach. You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
