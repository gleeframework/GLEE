"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
