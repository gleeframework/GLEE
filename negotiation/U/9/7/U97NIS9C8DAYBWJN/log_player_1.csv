Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, giving Alice leverage in the negotiation.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially avoid missing out."
