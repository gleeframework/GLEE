"Alice,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget limitations.  While $800,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is still below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'm offering a price of $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal if you're open to it.",950000.0,Alice,5,
