"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me right now.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. I think this represents a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I can feel it.  I'm willing to stretch my budget further and offer you $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, so I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and my previous offer, which would be $912,500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",912500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to meet you at $906,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",906000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $906,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'll meet you at $915,000. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",915000.0,Alice,9,
