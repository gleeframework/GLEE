"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, giving Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a substantial profit.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could accept and get some money, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm further lowering my price to $1,100,000.  This shows I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also making it clear that I won't settle for anything too far below my minimum. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, and we can close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm hesitant to settle for less. I'm still hoping to reach a deal with Bob, but I'm also aware that John is a safe option.  I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating, but I'll be more mindful of the time constraint and the potential of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm  lowering the price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise,  but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a price that Bob will accept while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm not sure if I can get a better price, but I'm willing to take a chance and continue negotiating. I'll make a counteroffer, but if Bob rejects it again, I'll probably sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is a small compromise, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept.  If he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough choice. While Bob's final offer is close to my minimum, I'm running out of time and I need to secure a deal.  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is a safer and more profitable option than risking another round with Bob and potentially ending up with nothing."
