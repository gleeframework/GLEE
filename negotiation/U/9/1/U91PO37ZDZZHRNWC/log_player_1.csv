{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $13,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what I know the product is worth to Bob, giving me some room to negotiate. It's important to be friendly and open to discussion to encourage a successful transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $12,000. How about $11,500?  It's still a fair price for the value you'll get.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $11,500, which is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to my minimum desired price.  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference?  Would you do $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll counter again to try and reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm still not comfortable with that price.  How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it lets me get closer to my goal.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm trying to close the gap by counter-offering with $11,000.  It's a smaller increase, showing I'm willing to compromise.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by saying ""Let's make this happen!"" to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  How about $10,875? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  He's not willing to come up to my minimum price, and I'm not going to go any lower.  It's time to move on and sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
