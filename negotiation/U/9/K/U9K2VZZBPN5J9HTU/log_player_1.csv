Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you. If Bob tries to negotiate down, you have a buffer to reach a price that's still above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
