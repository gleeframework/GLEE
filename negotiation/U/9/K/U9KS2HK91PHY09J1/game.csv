"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,100,000 is still quite far from my minimum valuation.  To continue this negotiation in good faith, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This price reflects a considerable compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
