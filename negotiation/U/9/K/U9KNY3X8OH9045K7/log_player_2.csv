"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($11,000 vs. $12,000).**  You can do better. 
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can potentially get a lower price from Alice.

**Next steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice, trying to get a price closer to your desired range."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than your asking price, and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you even more than your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your desired price.**  You want to pay as close to $9,500 as possible.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can likely get Alice to come down a bit more.

**Next steps:**  You should counter Alice's offer again, aiming for a price closer to your target of $9,500."
