"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than your asking price, and still leaves you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you even more than your initial assessment. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to me.  Let's finalize the deal at this price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
