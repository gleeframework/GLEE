"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend no more than $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  Bob should try to get closer to his target price of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Although Alice has come down to $9,200, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's target price, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
