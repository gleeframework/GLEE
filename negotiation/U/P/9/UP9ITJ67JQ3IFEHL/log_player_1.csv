Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product to me first.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that makes staying in the negotiation worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a significant profit compared to Bob's current offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the sure thing."
