"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob.  It's above his maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before potentially settling with John."
