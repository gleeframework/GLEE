"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it has significant value and could benefit you greatly. Considering its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential for your business.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our back and forth here, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me to accept. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
