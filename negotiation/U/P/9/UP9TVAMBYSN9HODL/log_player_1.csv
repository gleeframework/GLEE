Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is a significant amount above Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for profit:**  Even at this price, I'm still making a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John at $12,000 and having no room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By starting high, I create an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a more favorable price for me. 

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer. I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers and my assessment of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I'd prefer to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now make a counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his willingness to negotiate and my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm now offering a price of $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Testing the Waters:** By lowering the price, I'm gauging Bob's true willingness to pay. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer accordingly. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm not giving away too much. Selling to John for $12,000 is still a viable option if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I will analyze whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John for $12,000."
