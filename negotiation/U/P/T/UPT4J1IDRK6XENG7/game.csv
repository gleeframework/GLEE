,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a great deal for both of us!",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $86.  What do you think?",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $86 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $88? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not comfortable with $88. How about we settle at $87? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it.",87.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $87. How about we meet at $89? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",89.0,Alice,7,
