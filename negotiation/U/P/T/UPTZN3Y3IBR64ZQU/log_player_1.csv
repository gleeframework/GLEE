Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name] for a price of $1,750,000. This is a significant investment, but I believe the value it offers will be substantial for you.  I understand this might be a higher price than you initially anticipated, but I'm confident you'll see the potential for substantial returns. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The price:**  I've set the price at $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my ""fallback"" price of $1,500,000 (from John). 
* **The message:** The message is designed to:
    * **Highlight the value to Bob:**  Emphasizing the potential for returns will make the price seem less daunting.
    * **Be open to negotiation:**  The wording suggests a willingness to discuss the price if Bob is hesitant.
    * **Create urgency:**  While not explicitly stating a deadline, the phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" implies that the offer might not be open-ended. 

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing profit:**  There's a good chance Bob will accept the offer, as it's still below his estimated value.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Even if Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale to John, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  The message opens the door for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are many other ways to approach this situation depending on your risk tolerance and the specific nature of the product."
