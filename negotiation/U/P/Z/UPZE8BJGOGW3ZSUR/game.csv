"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
