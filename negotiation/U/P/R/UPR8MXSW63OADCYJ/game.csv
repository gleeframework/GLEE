"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to offer $85.  Let me know if that works for you.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $90.  This is a good compromise and allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,4,
