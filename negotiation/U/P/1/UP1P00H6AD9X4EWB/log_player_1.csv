Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will find this price attractive, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to him.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, hoping to meet him halfway.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and still provides a good profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's latest offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and prevents me from needing to sell to John at a lower price."
