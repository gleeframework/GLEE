"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, given its value to you. I'm confident it will be a very profitable investment for your business. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, given its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a fair profit for me. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
