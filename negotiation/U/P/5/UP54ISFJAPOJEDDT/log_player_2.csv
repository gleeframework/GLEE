Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, $75 is still a bit lower than my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $85 for the product. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

It's unlikely Alice will go below $85, and your goal is to save as much as possible. John offers a guaranteed price of $80, making it the best option now."
