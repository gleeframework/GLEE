Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know you'll find it valuable, and this is a price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but not unrealistically so leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secured with a guaranteed $8,000 from John. This allows for bolder negotiation."
