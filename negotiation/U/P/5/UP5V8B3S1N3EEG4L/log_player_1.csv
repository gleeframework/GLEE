Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You still have room to negotiate down if needed, and it's significantly better than selling to John at your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This helps keep the negotiation efficient. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $950000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, and I believe I have some leverage with John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $980,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's split the difference and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 980000}
