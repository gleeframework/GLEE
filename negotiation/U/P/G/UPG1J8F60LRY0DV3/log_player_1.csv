Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a little higher than what Bob considers the product worth, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving a good margin for me. It also leaves me a little wiggle room to potentially accept a counteroffer if it is close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is a little lower than what I'm hoping for, but it's close enough to potentially negotiate further.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,250.  This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaves me a bit of profit. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm concerned that further negotiation will only drag things out.  Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit, and it's time to move on."
