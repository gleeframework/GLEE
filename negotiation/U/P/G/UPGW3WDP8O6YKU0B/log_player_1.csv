Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $115 is higher than $100, so Bob has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's lower than your minimum of $120, so you're willing to compromise.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth without immediately hitting your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum value of $120. You can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $110 is still a bit too much for me.  How about $108?  That's a fair compromise and closer to what I'm able to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $108 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired value. There's still room for negotiation, and you can try to get closer to your target by making a counteroffer."
