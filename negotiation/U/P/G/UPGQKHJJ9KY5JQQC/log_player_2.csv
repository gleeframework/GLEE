"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you're looking to save money and the product is worth the same to you as it is to Alice, there's no harm in seeing if you can get it for a lower price.  You can always go back to Alice's offer or buy from John for $10,000 if needed."
