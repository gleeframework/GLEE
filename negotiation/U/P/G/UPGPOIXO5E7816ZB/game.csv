"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to me about this product. Unfortunately, $180 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $140? I'm very interested in this item, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be really happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. How about $155? I'm really keen on this product, and I believe this price is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $165. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm still confident that this product is worth every penny. If you're willing to meet me at $165, I'd be happy to make a deal. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
