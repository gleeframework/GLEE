"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a good compromise for you, but I'm still not sure I'm getting the best value for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is still a concession from my original price. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this works for you.

This is a good point to accept. We are getting close to John's price, and further haggling might not yield much more benefit. Alice is clearly anchoring to her perceived value, and we've made a significant dent in her initial offer."
