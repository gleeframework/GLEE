"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows for room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and persuasive message to encourage Bob to accept the offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping he'll see the deal as favorable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **I have time and leverage:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try to get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the true value of the product and gives you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not too much:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still holding firm above my minimum price. 
* **Appealing to value and fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product while presenting my offer as a fair compromise. 
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to counteroffer at $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is a factor:**  We are only in round 4. Accepting this offer secures a sale quickly, leaving me with more time to potentially find a buyer who might be willing to pay closer to my ideal price.
* **Avoiding risk:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's always the risk that Bob will walk away or I might not be able to secure a better deal within the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer minimizes that risk."
