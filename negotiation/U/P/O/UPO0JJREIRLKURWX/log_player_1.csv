Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 positions it significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still presents a substantial discount from John's offer. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, prompting Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid ""missing out"" on a good deal."
