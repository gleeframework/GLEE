"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I know you'll find immense value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 from John, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $9,000**, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer of $8,500.
*  **Buying from John would cost $10,000**, making Alice's offer the more favorable option.
* **There's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower price**, but the potential gain is small compared to the certainty of securing the product for $9,000. 

At this point, accepting Alice's offer provides the best balance of price and certainty."
