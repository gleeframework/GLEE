"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer will allow you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, but that's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer, it's still not a good deal for you.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again gives you a chance to push for a price closer to your limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,250,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $1100000 is a good step, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's getting closer, it's not a good deal for you.  Instead of continuing to negotiate with Alice, it makes more sense to buy the product from John at your budget limit of $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product without exceeding your budget."
