"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $1750000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1000000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, but that's the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  $1100000 is a good step, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
