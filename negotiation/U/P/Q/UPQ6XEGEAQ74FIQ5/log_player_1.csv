Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives me a bit of wiggle room for negotiation, while still being a good starting point for a potential sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm offering a price of $155. This is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price but reflects my willingness to compromise to secure a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at $145, which is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's likely that further negotiation will not result in a significantly higher offer. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle for John's offer of $150."
