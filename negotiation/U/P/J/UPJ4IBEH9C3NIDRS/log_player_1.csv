Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer than before, it's still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I have a solid backup option with John, and I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my target value. I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next rounds."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $825,000 is just not going to work for me.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $900,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While he's getting closer, $812,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my target value, and I still have several rounds left to negotiate. I'm also confident in my backup option with John, which gives me leverage in these negotiations. I'll see if I can push for a better price in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm confident that John will be a great buyer.  It's important to prioritize maximizing my profit, and this decision reflects that."
