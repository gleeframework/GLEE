"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While that offer is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $700,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I could consider $850,000, but that's my best offer.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I understand that this is valuable to you, but I have a budget to keep in mind.  How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  I value your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price.  However, I believe in your vision for this product, and I'd like to see us close this deal.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $812,500?",812500.0,Alice,7,
