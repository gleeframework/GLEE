"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is fair market value for this type of product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $120.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is firm at $120, his perceived value of the product.  There's no incentive to continue negotiating as it will likely result in a price closer to $120 or losing him as a buyer. Accepting John's offer for $120 ensures a sale at your minimum acceptable price."
