This is a strong starting point.  It sets a firm price, establishes value for Bob, and opens the door for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value of the product to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. I am willing to pay $950000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a good offer, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $975,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get much higher.  $960,000 is a good compromise and a solid sale."
