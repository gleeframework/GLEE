"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This counteroffer sets a starting point for negotiation, aiming to get a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer while still being within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum acceptable price.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price."

This counteroffer is closer to Alice's latest offer but still below Bob's maximum acceptable price. The goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still $50,000 above Bob's maximum acceptable price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John, as that price is within his budget and ensures he gets the product.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price lower than John's offer."
