{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,800,000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This takes into account its unique value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, I believe the product is worth pushing for a higher price with Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be firm on this product's value.  $1,500,000 is my final offer.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm holding firm at $1,500,000. This is a strong signal to Bob that I'm serious about this price being my limit, while still leaving room for a potentially larger profit than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob is unlikely to move much beyond $1,300,000. Accepting this offer secures a $300,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer. It's time to close the deal."
