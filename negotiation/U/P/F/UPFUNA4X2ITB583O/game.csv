"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,800,000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,600,000? This takes into account its unique value while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be firm on this product's value.  $1,500,000 is my final offer.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
