"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and I need to make sure it fits within it. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I'm open to one final counteroffer. ",1350000.0,Alice,5,
