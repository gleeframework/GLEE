"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit high, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your suggestion. However, I am looking to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with the $8,000 offer from Bob, I believe I can potentially do better.  There are still 9 rounds to go, giving me time to negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit higher than $8,000.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,500?  This still gives you a great deal, and helps me get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $8,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as I'm still below my ideal price. However,  I've already rejected Bob's offer twice, and with only 6 rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to John or not reaching a higher price with Bob is becoming significant.  I'm happy to take the $8,000 and avoid further negotiation risk."
