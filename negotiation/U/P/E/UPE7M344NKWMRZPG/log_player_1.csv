This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. This approach allows for negotiation and potential for a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $800,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, but it's still below it.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal.  I'll sell the product to John for $800,000."
