"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being a fair deal for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers.  You can save a considerable amount of money ($4,500) by going with John."
