"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you this product that I know is highly valuable to you. While I can't disclose the exact details of the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000, which is a significant discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  While Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, you know it's only worth $1,200,000 to you.  
* **Accepting Alice's offer saves you money.** You can buy the product for $1,400,000, which is less than John's price of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
