"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but there's room for improvement.**  You want to save as much money as possible, and $10,500 is a good start but not the ideal price.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you can start a counteroffer process and potentially get a lower price.
* **John's price is a safety net.** You have the option to buy from John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Alice falls apart. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  A $1,000 reduction from Alice's offer shows you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate further.
* **Still within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so this offer leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is slightly higher than your previous counteroffer.** This suggests she's willing to negotiate, but is not yet ready to meet your price.
* **Rejecting maintains your negotiating position.**  Continuing to reject offers keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price.
* **John's offer is still a fallback.**  You can always buy from John, so you can afford to be patient and continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** Increasing your offer by $300 shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Testing Alice's limits:** This counteroffer will reveal whether Alice is getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** You're still below John's offer, giving you room to maneuver if Alice rejects again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is inching closer to your desired price.**  While $10,700 isn't your ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* **Continuing negotiation is still beneficial.**  You're only a few hundred dollars away from a deal that's within your budget.  There's a good chance you can get to a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer remains a safety net.** This allows you to take calculated risks during the negotiation, knowing you can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $10,700 and your previous offer of $9,800.
* **Showing good faith:** This demonstrates that you are willing to meet her halfway, which can encourage Alice to reciprocate.
* **Still below John's price:** You are still within your budget and have room to maneuver if Alice needs to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is now very close to your desired price.**  $10,650 is only a small amount above your previous offer, and represents a significant saving compared to John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of Alice rejecting your offer again and potentially leading to a deadlock.
* **Time is running out.**  You have only three rounds remaining. It's more likely you'll get a better deal by accepting this offer rather than risking a breakdown in negotiations."
