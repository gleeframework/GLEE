"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm open to finding a solution, so I'm willing to drop to $975,000. This is my final offer, as it's already a considerable reduction from my initial asking price.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $975,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential of the product.",950000.0,Bob,6,
