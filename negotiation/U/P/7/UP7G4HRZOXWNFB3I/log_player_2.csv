"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what you're willing to pay and more than what I'd get from someone else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.
