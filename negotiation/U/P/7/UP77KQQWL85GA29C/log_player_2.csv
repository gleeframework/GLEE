"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm aiming for a price around $11,500.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I understand your position.  However, I know the true value of this product, and I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?  It's a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for Bob.  It's $1,000 less than John's price, and closer to Bob's ideal price point.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good compromise."
