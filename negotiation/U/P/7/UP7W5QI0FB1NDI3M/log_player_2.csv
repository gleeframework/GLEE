Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $620,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. How about we meet at $675,000?

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still making a reasonable profit. How about we meet at $658,000?

It's getting down to the wire, and Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit. While we could push for another round, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal. Accepting at $658,000 secures a substantial discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
