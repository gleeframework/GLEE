"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its worth to you. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $750000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time I've invested in it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, and I respect the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $850000. I would like to propose a price of $800000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you can consider it.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $800000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm thinking of a price of $825000. This is a generous offer, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
