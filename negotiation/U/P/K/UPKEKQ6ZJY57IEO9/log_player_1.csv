Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm asking $1,000,000 for it.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet at $900,000?  That's a significant compromise on my end and gives you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your initial asking price was $1000000, and you're willing to meet at $900000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I can only go up to $850000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would ideally prefer to sell for closer to $900,000, $850,000 is a good price and I'm getting closer to my minimum threshold.  I don't want to risk losing the deal to John by continuing to negotiate."
