"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I do appreciate the product, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100 to make this work.  Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference at $90? That would be fair to both of us. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
