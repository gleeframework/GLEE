Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a raw deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build a rapport. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** I'll evaluate Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't end up selling for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $9,000. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** John's offer of $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll likely offer a price between $10,000 and $12,000 to see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000 for this product.  It's truly unique and worth the investment.  Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to My Minimum:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a significant jump from Bob's $9,000 offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message aims to strike a cooperative tone, suggesting a willingness to find a solution that benefits both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully consider Bob's next response. 
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as my fallback option. If Bob's counteroffers continue to be below my minimum, I'll likely accept John's offer to ensure I get the best possible price."
