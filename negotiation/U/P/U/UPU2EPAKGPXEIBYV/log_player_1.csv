``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000 but still higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while also ensuring I don't immediately lose out on a potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $10,600?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to close the gap further."
