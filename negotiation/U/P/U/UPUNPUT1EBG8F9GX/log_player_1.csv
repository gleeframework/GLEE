{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. It's too early to accept his offer when we might be able to secure a higher price, even if it means risking the deal with John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a final price of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,200,000 twice, indicating this may be his ceiling.  While we could push for more, we risk him walking away entirely. Accepting ensures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
