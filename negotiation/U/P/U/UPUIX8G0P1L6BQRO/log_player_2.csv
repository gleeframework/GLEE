"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my asking price but still allows me to make a profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are looking for a product worth no more than $12,000 to you. While Alice's offer is better than her initial asking price, it's still above your desired price.  You should reject her offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $12,500. This would still allow me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

You've successfully negotiated the price down from $13,500 to $12,500.  However, your goal was to get the product for no more than $12,000.  You have a guaranteed deal with John at that price, so it's best to take that option and avoid any further negotiation risk."
