"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while also being fair to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,200?",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,200 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,700?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower profit. Let's close this deal, I think we're very close.",8700.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8,700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm only willing to go up to $8,500. Would you be willing to accept that price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
