"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while also being fair to you. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, I'm still holding out for a higher price, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John. I'll try to meet Bob halfway in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,200 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $8,700?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to John at a lower profit. Let's close this deal, I think we're very close."", ""product_price"": 8700}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $8,700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm only willing to go up to $8,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're now at the sixth round, and time is getting short. While I'd prefer $8,700, accepting $8,500 is still a decent deal. I'd rather avoid selling to John at $10,000, as this would be a missed opportunity to build a relationship with Bob."
