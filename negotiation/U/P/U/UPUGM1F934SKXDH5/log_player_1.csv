Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. This means he wouldn't logically pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Considering its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,450,000 is a strong opening, close to your minimum but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Exclusivity and Urgency:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and importance can encourage Bob to act faster. 
* **Value Emphasis:** By highlighting the ""value and potential,"" you frame the price in a positive light.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach.  Negotiation is dynamic. You might need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
