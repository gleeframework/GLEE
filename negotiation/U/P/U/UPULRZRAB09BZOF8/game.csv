"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,500. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm comfortable going to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're willing to go up to $11,000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $11,000, which would be $12,750. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12750.0,Alice,5,
