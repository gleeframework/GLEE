Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not at my desired range. I'll reject this offer and try to bring the price down further in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not quite ready to accept $875,000. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price range.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's possible we're at an impasse.  I'm also running out of time, as I only have 5 rounds remaining before I have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good deal for me, and I'm confident I can make a profit with this product."
