"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's estimated value of $800,000, but it's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a healthy profit.  We'll see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and leaves me with a significant loss.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's higher than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price to $1,200,000. This is a further concession, but it's still a considerable amount.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, and he'll be more willing to meet me halfway in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price in the next round. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}

I'm dropping my price again to $1,150,000. This is a substantial concession, and I'm hoping it will finally be enough to convince Bob to accept. With only a few rounds left, I need to make a decision soon.  We'll see if Bob's finally willing to meet me in the middle."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round. If he doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
