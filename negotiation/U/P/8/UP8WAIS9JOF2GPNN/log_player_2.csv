"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's start with my offer: $100 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is a good sign she's willing to negotiate. There's room to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation.  It shows you're aiming for a good deal without being unreasonably low right off the bat."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To move forward, I propose an offer of $90 for the product. This allows us to reach a middle ground while still considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is good. However, there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to our target. We'll counteroffer and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle on $85? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($90) and our previous counteroffer ($80). This shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiations, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to suggest $90 as a fair price for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit while accommodating your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has offered $90 twice now, indicating this is likely her sticking point. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal and there's a risk of her sticking to $90 or even raising the price. Accepting at $90 secures a reasonable discount."
