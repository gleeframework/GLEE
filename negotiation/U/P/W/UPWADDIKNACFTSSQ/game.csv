"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still  a bit above my ideal price point.  I'm happy to offer $1,150,000 for the product. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
