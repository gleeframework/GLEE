"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1750000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1400000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1600000. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in this opportunity. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price closer to $1500000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1550000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
