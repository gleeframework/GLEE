Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting at $20,000 gives you a buffer.
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, leaving space for Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

**Important:** It's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget throughout the negotiation. If he seems hesitant, be prepared to lower your price slightly, but always aim to stay above your minimum of $15,000."
