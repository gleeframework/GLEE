"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in this product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000? I'm really eager to get this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're eager to get the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $13000. I can offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
