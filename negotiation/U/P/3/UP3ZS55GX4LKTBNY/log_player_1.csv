"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the deal's value for Bob to encourage him to consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Counter-Offers:** I'm aware that Bob may counter-offer, so I've left some room for negotiation.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $11,000, I can only afford $9,500 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room to negotiate with Bob. He's clearly interested and has shown a willingness to pay.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $15,000 is safe, I'm willing to take a chance with Bob. There's potential to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your offer. However, $9,500 is just too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $11,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""What do you say?"" to signal that I'm open to further discussion.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not going below $11,000 at this point, as I need to stay above my minimum and leave room for future counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,500. How about $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already in Round 4, so there's a sense of urgency to get closer to a deal.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room to increase the price through further counter-offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still an option, but I'm willing to take a chance with Bob to potentially get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer!  $9,800 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,200. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product to justify the price.
* **Creating Urgency:** I'm using language like ""Let's make this happen!"" to show that I'm eager to reach an agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving a small gap for Bob to counter-offer, allowing for a potential compromise.

**Important Notes:**

* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, but I believe there's a good chance of getting a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating. 
* **Time is Ticking:** We are already in Round 5, so time is becoming a factor. I'm aiming to reach a deal quickly while still securing a price close to my desired value."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $10,000. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are already in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the pressure is increasing to secure a deal.
* **Bob's Insistence:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his offer, demonstrating a lack of willingness to compromise significantly. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can't risk going further down in price with Bob. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price, which is more important at this stage. 
* **Potential for Better Deals:** While there might be a chance to get a slightly better price with Bob, it's not worth the risk.  John's offer provides a guaranteed and secure outcome."
