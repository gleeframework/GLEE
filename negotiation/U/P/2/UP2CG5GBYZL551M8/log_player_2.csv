"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than what I'm asking. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. You can likely get it for less.  It's worth rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above what the product is worth to her ($80). You can likely get it for less. It's worth rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer."
