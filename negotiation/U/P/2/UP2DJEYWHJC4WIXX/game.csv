"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its worth to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves room for profit for me, but it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,750, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This price still allows me to cover my costs and make a small profit. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
