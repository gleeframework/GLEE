I'm starting with a price of $135. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$110 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and $115 is still below my minimum.  John is a guaranteed sale for $120, so I'll go with him."
