"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to me.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $9,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $7,000, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $7,000. I can offer you a price of $8,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
