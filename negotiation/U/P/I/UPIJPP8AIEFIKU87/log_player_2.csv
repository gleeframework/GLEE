"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is less than what Bob is willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  It's clear we both recognize the inherent value of this product.  To find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a fair return on this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a good deal considering he was willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and Bob ultimately having to pay John's price is too high."
