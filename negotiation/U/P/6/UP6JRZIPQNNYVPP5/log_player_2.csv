# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a substantial gap from what I had in mind.  The value this product brings to the table is undeniable, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000?  This reflects my willingness to find a compromise while acknowledging the true worth of this product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
