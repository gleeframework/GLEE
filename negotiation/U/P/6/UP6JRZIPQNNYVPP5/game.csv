"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my initial asking price.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works for us both.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,200,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my means. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a substantial gap from what I had in mind.  The value this product brings to the table is undeniable, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. How about we meet halfway at $1,700,000?  This reflects my willingness to find a compromise while acknowledging the true worth of this product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
