"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again to try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still eager to purchase this product, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm very interested in this product, and while $1,025,000 is still a bit high, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
