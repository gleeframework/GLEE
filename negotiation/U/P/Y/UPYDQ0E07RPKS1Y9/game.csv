"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down a bit? Would you be willing to consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming back to me. While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still a touch higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still below my minimum. To be fair, let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This price is a significant gain for you, considering the value you place on this product. I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $962,500? That's a good compromise, and it reflects the value of this product to you. Let's close this deal and move forward.",962500.0,Alice,7,
