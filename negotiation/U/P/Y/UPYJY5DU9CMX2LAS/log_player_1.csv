Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Value to Bob Unknown:** Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming high to maximize my potential profit.
* **Plan B:**  I have a guaranteed backup option with John at $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me negotiating leverage.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll analyze Bob's reaction to see if he accepts, rejects, or makes a counteroffer. 
* **Negotiating Strategy:**  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, potentially dropping the price slightly if necessary, but never going below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer. While it's still above my minimum value, there's room for improvement.
* **Potential for Higher Value:** I believe there's a good chance Bob values the product higher than $1,100,000, given his willingness to make a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I'm not eager to settle for the bare minimum. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. This allows me to explore if I can push for a higher price in the next round.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial $1,500,000, but taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer to $1,300,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still a good profit margin. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining leverage.
* **Signaling Flexibility:**  By lowering the price, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm open to negotiating further. However, it's still a substantial offer that demonstrates the value of the product.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While I'm taking a calculated risk by rejecting Bob's offer, I believe there's still room for a better outcome.  I'm hoping to find a price that maximizes my profit while ensuring a successful sale. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Prepared for Negotiation:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further, potentially lowering my price incrementally if necessary, but always staying above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  It's unlikely I can push for a significantly higher price with Bob, considering his counteroffers so far. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $1,000,000 offer from John.
* **Secure Profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalization:** I will proceed with finalizing the sale with Bob at $1,050,000. 
* **Future Strategies:** I will analyze this negotiation to learn from the experience and develop better strategies for future transactions."
