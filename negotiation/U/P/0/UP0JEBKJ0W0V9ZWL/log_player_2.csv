"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her own valuation of the product ($80).
* While $100 is less than your maximum budget ($120), there's a chance you can get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and potentially find a better deal. 
* John acts as your backup, ensuring you can still get the product if Alice doesn't budge on her price."
