"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for this product.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $18,000 is high, but I've done some research and I'm confident this product is worth more to you than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I still think $11,500 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to compromise at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $13,500 is still a bit steep for me. I can do $12,000, and I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really think this product is worth more to me than that, but I'm willing to make a deal with you.",12500.0,Alice,7,
