,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering the value you place on it.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects its value to me, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, which reflects a fair compromise between our desired prices. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is a very fair price given the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",14500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $16,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $15,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",15750.0,Alice,7,
