"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",10000.0,Alice,3,
