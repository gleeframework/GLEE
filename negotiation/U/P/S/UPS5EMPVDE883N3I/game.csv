"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we are still quite far apart on price.  While I believe your product is good, I can't justify going that high.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? That reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  I could go up to $1,000,000.  That's my absolute limit.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
