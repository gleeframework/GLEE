"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I have to say that I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $800000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
