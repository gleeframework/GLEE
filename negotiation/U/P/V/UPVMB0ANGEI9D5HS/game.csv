"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value of this product to both of us, I'd like to offer you $850000. This leaves room for both of us to make a profitable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a significant step up from your initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product and our previous discussions. I believe this offer is a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $980000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a relatively small increase from your last offer. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",980000.0,Alice,5,
