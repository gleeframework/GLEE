This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that offers unparalleled value and benefits. I believe this price reflects the exceptional quality and utility of the product while providing you with a significant savings. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum valuation of $10,000 and John's offer of $10,000. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or proceeding with John's offer."
