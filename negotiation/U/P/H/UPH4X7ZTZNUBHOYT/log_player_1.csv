Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $120, so there's room to negotiate upwards if he's interested.
* **It's a fair price:**  $115 is a good middle ground, offering Bob a discount while still giving you a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can't go above $100 for the product. Let me know if you can meet me halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. You're aiming for a higher price, and rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer. You can try to meet him halfway, or propose a slightly lower price than your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
