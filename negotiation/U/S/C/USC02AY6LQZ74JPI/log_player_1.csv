Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth at least $8,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher asking price in negotiations. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he negotiates you down.
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  You know John is your safety net at $8,000. Aiming for $10,000 gives you a potential $2,000 profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies you're open to discussion (""willing to let it go"").  Bob might counter-offer, and you can then potentially meet in the middle."
