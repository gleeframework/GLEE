Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $9,500 is a strong starting point, it allows some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants, potentially still landing above your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message subtly highlights the product's value to encourage Bob to accept."
