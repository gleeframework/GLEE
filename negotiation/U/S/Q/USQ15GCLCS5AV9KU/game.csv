"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little high for me right now. Would you consider  $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $775,000, as I mentioned in my previous counteroffer?",775000.0,Alice,5,,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer. How about we settle at $787,500?",787500.0,Alice,7,,
