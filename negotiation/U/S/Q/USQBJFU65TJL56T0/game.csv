"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I do appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $160 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $155? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
