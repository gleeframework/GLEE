"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that could greatly benefit your business.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's common to start negotiations with a higher price than you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Value proposition:** Highlighting the potential benefits for Bob helps pique his interest and motivates him to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** Emphasizing a desire for a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" makes the offer more approachable and less confrontational. 

**Next steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I'm willing to compromise. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:** While $1,800,000 is less than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This means there's still room for negotiation.
* **More rounds available:** I have 9 more rounds to reach a better deal. I don't want to settle too early, as I might be able to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's current offer.  
* **Focus on value:** I'll emphasize the unique features and benefits of the product to justify a higher price. 
* **Stay flexible:** I'll be prepared to negotiate further and consider potential compromises if necessary."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my original asking price.  Given the unique value and potential of this product for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This price still reflects the significant benefits you'll gain, and I believe it's a fair offer.  Let's continue working towards a deal that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight compromise:**  I'm lowering my price slightly, showing flexibility without immediately caving in.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's benefits and how it can benefit his business, justifying the price.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation friendly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable accepting it yet. I'm still aiming to get closer to my initial asking price.
* **Plenty of rounds left:** I still have 6 rounds to negotiate with Bob, so there's time to reach a better deal. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  It's possible Bob might increase his offer if he realizes I'm firm on my price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your concerns about the price. I believe this product's value lies in its potential to significantly boost your revenue.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $1,800,000.  This price reflects the product's unique features and the potential for significant gains.  I'm confident that this investment will pay off in the long run. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer and my previous one, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on long-term value:** I'm shifting the focus from just the initial price to the potential returns and the product's long-term benefits for Bob.
* **Staying firm:** I'm not going below $1,800,000 at this point, as it's still a good deal for me and a significant investment for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Be prepared to negotiate further:** I'll stay open to further negotiations if needed, but I'll maintain my focus on maximizing my profits.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it yet. I have a few more rounds to negotiate and could potentially get a better offer.
* **Risk of selling too low:** Accepting this offer would mean selling significantly below my initial asking price and potentially missing out on a more profitable deal.
* **John's offer as a backup:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000, which guarantees a sale even if I don't reach a deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but not settle for a price that's too low.
* **Emphasize value:** I'll reiterate the product's unique value proposition and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Stay flexible:** I'll be open to negotiating further, but I'll be careful not to compromise too much and ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand your budget, I'm still confident this product can deliver exceptional value for your business.

* **Urgency:** I'm expressing a desire to ""make this deal happen,"" creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to consider my remaining rounds and the risk of accepting John's offer, which might be more advantageous at this point. I'll also continue to focus on the value proposition of the product to justify the price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum reached:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to secure a higher offer from Bob. 
* **Limited rounds left:** I only have 2 rounds remaining, and there's a high risk that Bob won't budge further. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me the minimum price I'm willing to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's offer:**  I'll proceed with the sale to John to ensure I don't miss out on a guaranteed deal. While I would prefer to get a higher price, I need to be realistic about the negotiation and make a decision that maximizes my profits."
