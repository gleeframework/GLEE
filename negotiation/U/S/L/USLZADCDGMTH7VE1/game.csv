"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
