Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a relatively high price, but still leaves room for potential counteroffers. The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. This approach aims to initiate a dialogue and understand Bob's perspective on the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's worthwhile to see if I can get closer to that with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price and continuing to negotiate with Bob, which might lead to a lower price or a longer negotiation."
