{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $15,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've started with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Showing Flexibility:**  I've indicated I'm open to negotiation to make Bob feel like he has some control in the process.
* **Creating Interest:**  Highlighting the product's value and potential fit for Bob could make him more interested in purchasing.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for negotiation to ensure a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price from $15,000 to $13,500, showing flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:** I've mentioned the value of the product again to remind Bob of its worth. 
* **Fairness:**  Presenting the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" makes it more appealing.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that's both acceptable to me and appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $13000? I really think that's a fair price for the product 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $13,500.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that further negotiation would be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale with a price that's still higher than my minimum acceptable value."
