"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $750,000. This is a fair middle ground, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on price. However,  $750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $725,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm thinking of a price of $720,000.
