Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. How about $700,000?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is far too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $850,000.

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and it reflects my desire to reach an agreement with you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

It's getting close, but I'm running out of rounds. $775,000 is still below my minimum price and I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a worse deal.  I'll sell to John for $800,000."
