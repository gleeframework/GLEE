"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1750000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1250000,  which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this transaction. ",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1100000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm prepared to come down to $1150000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
