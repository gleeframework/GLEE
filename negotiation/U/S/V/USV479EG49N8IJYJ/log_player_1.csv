"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for several rounds of counteroffers before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1750000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** 
* **There are still 9 rounds left.** I have ample opportunity to negotiate a better price with Bob, or sell to John if the negotiations fail. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000,  which is still a great deal for you. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both benefit from this transaction. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer.
* **Still above my minimum:** $1,250,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, and closer to the middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:** I'm framing it as a ""great deal"" and a ""fair compromise"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:**  If Bob still refuses, I can further lower my price in the following rounds, while keeping the deal above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's an improvement from his previous offer, $1,100,000 is still less than what I'm willing to accept.
* **I have 6 rounds left.** This gives me enough time to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John if necessary.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired price.** I can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm prepared to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying above my minimum:** $1,150,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting compromise:** I emphasize that this is a ""fair price"" and a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on finalizing the deal:** I'm aiming to push Bob towards finalizing the deal by stating ""let's see if we can finalize this deal"". 
* **Maintaining negotiating power:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still counter with a lower price in the next rounds, while keeping the deal above my minimum."
