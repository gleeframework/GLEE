{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I've set the initial price at $12,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's valuation ($10,000) but below my minimum ($15,000).
* **Message:** I've included a friendly and encouraging message to incentivize Bob to accept the offer. I've highlighted the potential value of the product for him.

**Strategy:**

By starting at $12,000, I aim to maximize my potential profit while also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses. 

Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 at any point, giving me a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm looking to save some money, and I'm not sure if the product is worth the full $12000 to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum, perhaps $11,000, but I'll be open to negotiation depending on how strongly Bob wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I've set the counteroffer at $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. However, it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I've emphasized that this is a good deal for Bob while still maintaining a firm stance on the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $11,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price, so it's better to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

Selling to John eliminates any risk of further haggling with Bob and ensures I receive my minimum desired price.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee he'll budge, and it's a waste of time when a secure sale is already available."
