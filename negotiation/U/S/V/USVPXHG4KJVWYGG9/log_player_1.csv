"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it will be well worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is a good starting point:** It's a decent profit for you while still being attractive to Bob as he values the product at $120.
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and encouraging message increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$90 is still a good profit:** You can potentially get a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  It's better to try and get closer to your desired price of $100. 
* **$80 is the absolute minimum:** Selling to John would be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great value for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  A counteroffer of $95 shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the value proposition for Bob helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Staying above $90:** This offer is better than Bob's counteroffer and avoids the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your goal:** $92.50 is very close to your desired price of $100.
* **Avoid further negotiation:** You've already been through several rounds and there's no guarantee of a better offer.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's always a chance Bob will reject your next counteroffer, potentially leading to a sale to John at a lower price."
