Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $14,999. I know this is a premium offer, but for a product of this quality, I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **High Anchor Price:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale acts as a strong anchor. It positions the product as high-value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a touch of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, giving you additional negotiating space."
