"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $1800000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  I'm proposing $1900000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
