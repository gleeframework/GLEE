# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,200,000**. This is still more than your target price of $1,500,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer** means you'll buy from John for $1,500,000. This is your maximum budget, so while you don't save money, you still meet your goal of buying the product within your budget."
