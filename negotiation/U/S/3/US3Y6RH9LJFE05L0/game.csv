I'd like to offer you the product for $14000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $8000.,14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there at $12500. How about $11000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can do $12000, which is my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Let me know if that works for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference - $11250. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",11250.0,Bob,6,
