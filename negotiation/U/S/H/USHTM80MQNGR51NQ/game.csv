"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle? I could consider  $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,400,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit much. How about we settle at $1,000,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $1,000,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I could potentially accept $1,150,000 â€“ it's my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
