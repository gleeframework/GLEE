Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110. I'm willing to compromise further, though. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a reasonable price considering the product's value.

Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and I'm not willing to pay more than John's price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
