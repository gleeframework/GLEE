"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $90. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer because you can get the product for $80 from John. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you have a fallback option, so there's no need to accept her first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $85?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While $87.50 is lower than her original price, it's still higher than what you can get from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a good chance you can get her down to your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get it for closer to my budget.  Would you consider $82.50?  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product."", ""product_price"": 82.5}
