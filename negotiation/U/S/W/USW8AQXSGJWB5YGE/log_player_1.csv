Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to value:** Highlighting the value the product brings can make Bob more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Openness to negotiation:** The message shows I'm willing to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000, so this gives me a safety net and bargaining power. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.  
* I'll keep John in mind as a backup option throughout the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **I have a strong alternative:**  I can sell to John for $1,200,000, making this deal unnecessary.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested.  I can likely get a better price by counter-offering.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind his initial offer and my ability to sell to John as my backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering closer to my minimum:** $850,000 is a significant compromise, but still higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value and compromise:** I emphasize that this is a ""reasonable profit"" for me, implying I'm making a concession to reach a deal.
* **Keeping the negotiation going:**  This counteroffer keeps the conversation open and encourages further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.  I'll consider John as a backup option, and whether I can get a better price from Bob with further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm getting closer, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, $725,000 is still below my desired price point.
* **Selling to John is still a better option:**  I can get $1,200,000 from John, making this deal less attractive.
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  There's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $725,000, but lower than my previous offer. I'll aim for a price closer to $800,000.  I'll keep in mind that John is a reliable backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to keep the deal moving forward.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (sort of):**  $800,000 is the middle ground between my previous offer of $850,000 and Bob's current offer of $725,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasis on a fair deal:** Highlighting that it's a ""fair price for both of us"" can make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Positive closing:**  The message ends with a positive and encouraging statement to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal that's close to my minimum acceptable price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider selling to John as the negotiations are unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob."
