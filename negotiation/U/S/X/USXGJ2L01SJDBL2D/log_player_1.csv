{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me some profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to get a good price while still leaving room for negotiation if he counters. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120."
