Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $80.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Since Bob values the product at $80, I'm offering it to him at that price. This ensures a deal and maximizes my profit, as I know I can get $80 from John if Bob rejects."
