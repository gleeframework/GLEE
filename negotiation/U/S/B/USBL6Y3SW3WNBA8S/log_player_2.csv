# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a competitive price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before resorting to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the market value of similar items. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and rarity.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than the initial offer, $1,200,000 is still outside of Bob's maximum budget.  He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it's worth seeing if Alice will go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is a compromise that takes into account your budget and the value of the product.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for a lower price from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing out on the better deal with John."
