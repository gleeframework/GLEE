"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is high quality, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll be happy with the quality you'll receive.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to, and $9,000 is still pushing it.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll be happy with the quality you'll receive.",10500.0,Alice,5,
