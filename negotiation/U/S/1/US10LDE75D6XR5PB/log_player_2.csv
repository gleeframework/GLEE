"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I believe you'll be very happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down significantly before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is high quality, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll be happy with the quality you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a significant amount above John's price. Let's keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to, and $9,000 is still pushing it.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll be happy with the quality you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from this point. It's not worth risking the extra money when we have a guaranteed offer from John at $8,000."
