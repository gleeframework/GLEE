"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from the value he places on the product, making it a compelling offer. I'm confident he'll find it worthwhile, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my target of $1,400,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer."

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,350,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that still leaves room for profit while being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
