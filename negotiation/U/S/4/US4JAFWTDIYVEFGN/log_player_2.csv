"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $100,000 above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $825000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000, though it is closer.  There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject and try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can't reach an agreement at that price, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $850000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there is a chance that Alice might go lower, Bob has already made his absolute maximum offer and Alice has rejected it twice.  This indicates that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better price.  Therefore, Bob should buy the product from John for his maximum budget of $800,000 to ensure he gets the product within his desired price range."
