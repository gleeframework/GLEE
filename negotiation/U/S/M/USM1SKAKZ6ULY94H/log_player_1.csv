"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially gives me a good starting point for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore those options in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it still leaves some room for profit and is closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to push for a bit more and see if I can get a better deal. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to keep negotiating with Bob, we're getting very close to the end of the rounds, and I'm worried that we won't reach a deal that's satisfactory to me. It's not worth risking losing out on a sure thing with John.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
