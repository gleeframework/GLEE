{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act swiftly."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The price of $1,150,000 is still significantly below your minimum and leaves a substantial profit margin for Bob, making it an enticing offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
