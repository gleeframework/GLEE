"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $800000? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $785000. It's a fair price, and I think we can call it a day at this point.",785000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $785000, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet in the middle at $785000, but I'd like to propose a 1% discount for a quick sale. That would bring the price to $779500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",779500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to give you a 1% discount, but I'm willing to meet you at $785000 as I mentioned before. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. Is that enough to seal the deal?",785000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $780000 for the product, including the warranty and maintenance package. Is that a deal?",780000.0,Bob,10,
