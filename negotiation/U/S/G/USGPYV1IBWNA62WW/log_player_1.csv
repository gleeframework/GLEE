Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This is because:

* **Potential for Higher Value:** I don't know the value of the product to Bob. He may be willing to pay a premium for it, which is why I'm offering a higher price. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Even if Bob rejects my offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000. This higher offer gives me a chance to potentially maximize my earnings.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher sale price."
