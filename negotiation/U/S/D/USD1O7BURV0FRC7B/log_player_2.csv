"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is highly valued by our clients. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you for $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save money and know you can get the product for $120 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer. Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product. However, my budget for this type of item is $100. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'd like to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $110 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll reject your counteroffer, potentially pushing the price higher. Accepting the offer of $110 saves you $10 compared to buying from John and provides a reasonably good deal."
