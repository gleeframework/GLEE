Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he might get a deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the price is justified without explicitly stating it's worth more than Bob's valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the conversation going.
* **Alternative:** By mentioning she'll list it publicly (John is a backup), she creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act.

**Important Note:**  While Alice has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, there's potential to earn significantly more from Bob. This approach balances risk and reward."
