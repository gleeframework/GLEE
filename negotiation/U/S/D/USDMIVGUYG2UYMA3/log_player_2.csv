"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. I'm confident this price represents a great deal for you, given the product's worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from the product's true value to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before potentially buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000?  This price is still a great deal for you, considering your own valuation of the product.  I'm open to further discussion, but I need to be closer to my desired price point.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. However, it's closer to my desired price than her previous offer, suggesting that we might be able to reach a compromise.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before buying from John."
