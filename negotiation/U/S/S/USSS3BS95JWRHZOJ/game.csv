"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $1,900,000? This acknowledges the value while still offering you a significant opportunity.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart on price. I appreciate you trying to find middle ground, but that number is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. If that doesn't work, we might need to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is substantial, and $900,000 doesn't reflect that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable compromise. This is my final offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
