"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($12,000) is better for you than John's offer ($15,000).** You save $3,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* While you could reject Alice's offer, you would then have to pay $15,000 to John, which is not a desirable outcome."
