"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  That price is a bit high for me though.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down, but it leaves room for negotiation and establishes a starting point well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you a deal at $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from what I had in mind. Would $110 work for you?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This offer inches closer to my maximum while still leaving room for me to negotiate upward if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal at $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is splitting the difference, but that's still above my maximum budget and John's offer. I need to hold firm."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $140 is still a bit more than I can do. I'm willing to go up to $115. That's a fair offer, and I hope we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

I'm edging closer to my maximum, but I want to see if I can get Alice to meet me closer to my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! I'm willing to meet you at $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower.  While I could try to haggle further, John's offer is a guaranteed $120 and saves me further negotiation.  It's time to go with the sure thing."
