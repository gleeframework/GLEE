"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. Considering my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1200000? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for a mutually beneficial deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $1300000. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
