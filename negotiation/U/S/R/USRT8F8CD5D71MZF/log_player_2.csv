"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$120 is still too high for Bob. He's aiming for a price closer to $100. It's better to reject and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to $100. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and should hopefully start a more agreeable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's target, he's still aiming for a lower price. He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a compromise from his previous offer and shows that he's willing to negotiate. It's a reasonable price for both parties to consider."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has already rejected a price of $110 and Alice has shown a willingness to come down.  $108 is within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise, especially considering he has limited rounds remaining.  Continuing to negotiate might risk the deal falling through and forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price."
