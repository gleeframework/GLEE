"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's last offer, but it's still a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. It also leaves some room for compromise if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still $3,000 more than what he'd pay John. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down closer to Bob's desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $10,000 is a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous counteroffer. It's a reasonable price point that shows Bob's willingness to negotiate, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still $2,500 more than what he'd pay John.  Bob has already shown a willingness to negotiate and has only 5 rounds left. It's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. Offering $9,500 is a compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's last offer. It's a price that shows Bob's seriousness in closing the deal, but still leaves some room for Alice to negotiate if she's willing.  With only four rounds left, time is running out to get a lower price."
