"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and shows that I'm open to making a deal.  However, it's still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, which could encourage him to counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value and even lower than his perceived value. Accepting it would be a huge loss for me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still well above Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give away the product for a ridiculously low price. I'm hoping this counter-offer will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to take a slight loss to get a deal done, but not that much. I'll counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final attempt to meet Bob halfway. This offer is right in the middle of our last two offers, and it's still slightly above my minimum acceptable value. If he rejects this, I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. The negotiation is getting close to a breaking point, and I'm concerned we won't reach an agreement. 

Given the remaining rounds and the fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm choosing to secure the sale with John for $15,000. This ensures I receive the maximum value for my product, even if it means missing out on a potential deal with Bob."
