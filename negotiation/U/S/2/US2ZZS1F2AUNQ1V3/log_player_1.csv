I'm starting high, at $1,700,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a price above my minimum value.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for more.  I'll counter and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm coming down a bit to $1,650,000. It's still above my minimum and shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good compromise and we can close the deal."

Bob's offer is very close to my target price. It's more than what John is offering, and we're already in round 4, so I think it's time to close the deal."
