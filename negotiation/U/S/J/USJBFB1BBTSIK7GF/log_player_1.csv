Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is a significant discount for Bob while still being above my minimum acceptable price. It also leaves room for negotiation while making it clear that I'm willing to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial ask, Bob's offer is still a significant profit for me and above my minimum.  Accepting his offer secures the sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
