"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a very competitive price. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $13500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $13,500, which is lower than John's price of $15,000.
* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $1,500 compared to buying from John."
