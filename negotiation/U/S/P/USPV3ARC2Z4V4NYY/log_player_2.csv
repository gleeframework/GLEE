{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore potentially better prices."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, hoping to establish a lower starting point for negotiations.  He's offering a price that is still attractive to Alice, as it's closer to her value than John's offer. By presenting his offer as a budget constraint, Bob is setting the stage for a negotiation based on compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $10,800 is a better deal than John's offer, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, potentially finding a compromise closer to his $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,800.  How about $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a gradual counteroffer, demonstrating his commitment to finding a compromise.  By offering $10,500, he's signaling his willingness to move closer to Alice's position while still keeping the price within a comfortable range for himself. The message emphasizes fairness, aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and create a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10,600. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already come down significantly from her initial price, and this offer is a good deal for Bob, saving him $1400 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or stick to her current price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price without risking losing the deal."
