"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic in negotiations to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, we aim to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if the final price is lower, it might still seem like a good deal compared to the initial offer. 
* **Leaving Room:** Since we have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John at any time, we have some flexibility to negotiate. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is a good fallback option.  Let's see if we can bring Bob closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I believe my initial price is closer to the true worth of this product in the current market.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from $1,900,000 to $1,750,000, which might signal to Bob that we are willing to negotiate. However, we're still keeping the price well above both his offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""current market,"" we subtly imply that external factors support a higher price.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help us gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be and how far we might need to adjust to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,300,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices, so I'm offering $1,725,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, it's not guaranteed that Bob would agree. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
