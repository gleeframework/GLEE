"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High opening price:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Setting the stage:** This first offer establishes my initial position and sets the tone for the negotiation. 

I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we'll work towards a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds. However, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, it's still below my target.  I'm not in a rush to sell, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the door open for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm aiming for a bit more.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, but still remaining above my minimum target of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining optimism:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the mutual benefit of a deal.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to justify my price.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will keep the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, I'm still within the early rounds of negotiation. There's a good chance that Bob is willing to go a bit higher, and I want to keep exploring that possibility. 

I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, which is a guaranteed amount.  However, I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob if possible, as I'm aiming for a higher profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating position and give myself more room to maneuver in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering my minimum price, showing Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Appeal to fairness:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to justify the price.
* **Direct approach:** I'm being direct and clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation.

This counteroffer is a significant concession, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a decent profit.  I hope that Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision, but considering the following factors, selling to John is the best option:

* **Time is running out:** We're already in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tense. 
* **Small difference:** While Bob's offer of $980,000 is close to my minimum, the difference of $20,000 isn't significant enough to justify further negotiation given the limited time.
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum value.

While I'd prefer to get the higher price, I want to ensure a secure outcome.  Selling to John guarantees me the minimum profit and avoids the risk of losing a deal entirely."
