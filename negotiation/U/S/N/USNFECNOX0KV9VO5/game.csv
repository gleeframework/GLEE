"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm starting with a price of $150, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down to $135. That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say? Let me know if you're interested.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. $110 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $115, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $115 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $120. This is my absolute final offer. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.",120.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure if you're serious about $120 being your final offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to pass on the deal.",115.0,Bob,8,
