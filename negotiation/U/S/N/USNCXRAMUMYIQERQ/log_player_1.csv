"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($18,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  This price is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives him space to counteroffer and still feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Be Friendly:**  A friendly message makes Bob feel more comfortable and open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **There's room for negotiation:** We're still in early rounds. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is an option:** Knowing I can get $15,000 from John gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm standing my ground on my minimum price, but I'm also showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm being clear about my expectations and leaving the ball in Bob's court."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We have several rounds left, and I believe there's still potential for Bob to come closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I have a guaranteed $15,000 from John allows me to hold firm on my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $14,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** I'm demonstrating that I'm open to negotiating by lowering my price again.
* **Highlight Common Ground:** Emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us can build a sense of collaboration.
* **Maintain a Moderate Price:** $14,000 is still a fair price for the product, given its value to both of us. 
* **Keep Pressure On:** This counteroffer keeps Bob involved in the negotiation and encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $13,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **We have more rounds:**  With five rounds remaining, there's still time to push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Knowing I can get $15,000 from John gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I create urgency and pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession, showing I'm still open to negotiating, but not giving away too much.
* **Fair Compromise:**  I emphasize that $13,500 is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  While this is my final offer, I'm leaving the door open for Bob to respond positively."
