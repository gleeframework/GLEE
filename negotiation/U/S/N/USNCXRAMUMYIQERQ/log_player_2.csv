"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $18,000 is way too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

We start with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's bottom line and leave room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $15,000 is her value, not ours.  We'll keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

We are moving closer to Alice's price, but still leaving room to negotiate downwards, ideally towards a price closer to $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $14,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but we're still above our ideal price. Let's see if we can push Alice a bit further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $13,000 is the highest I can go.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

We are now getting closer to the end of the negotiation and need to signal we are reaching our upper limit. This offer is a strong signal that we're serious but not willing to go beyond our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,000 isn't quite enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good deal! Alice has come down significantly, and while it's a bit above our ideal price, it's still a much better deal than John's $14,000 offer. We've negotiated well and secured a reasonable price."
