"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and it's significantly more than my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to an even better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. This still allows me to save some money while getting a great deal on the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $975,000 to make this deal work.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to make sure I get a fair return.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. After considering your proposal, I believe a price closer to my valuation would be more reasonable. I would like to counter with a price of $960,000. This still gives us room for negotiation while ensuring a fair deal for both parties.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $960,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $965,000. This gives you a great deal on the product, while still allowing me to reach a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement this round.",965000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I've considered your suggestion, and I would like to counter with a price of $962,500. This still offers a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",962500.0,Bob,6,
