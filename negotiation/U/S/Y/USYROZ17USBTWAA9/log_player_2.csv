Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what I'm willing to pay. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's around $12,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings is truly significant, and $12,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer is still too high for me. I'll reject her offer and send a new counteroffer that's even lower than my previous one. I'll aim for a price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay, which is around $10,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that's even lower than my previous one, and closer to the price I'm willing to pay. Since I'm not willing to go above $10,000, I'll aim for a price that's right at the upper limit of my budget.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm really trying to keep costs down. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
