Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings is truly significant, and $12,000 undervalues it considerably. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm really trying to keep costs down. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear that $10,000 is his absolute limit. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price of $15,000."
