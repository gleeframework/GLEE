"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, but I have to warn you, it's a high-end item. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss $22000? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",18500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $20000? It's still a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $20000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we discuss $19250? I think that's a fair price for this product.",19250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to my bottom line, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $19500. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.",19500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $19500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $19000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that if we can't agree on a price, I might need to look elsewhere.",19000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated that we're not able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get something close to my minimum price. I'll meet you at $19250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",19250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $19250 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to walk away from this deal if we can't agree on a price. I'm going to have to explore other options, including buying from John for $10000.",19000.0,Bob,10,
