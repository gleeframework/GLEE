Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its value and features, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I am proposing a price of $12,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is at my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better outcome. John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is the same as Bob's offer. It makes the most sense to take the guaranteed sale and avoid further negotiation."
