Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit, while still being enticing enough for Bob:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  This offer starts close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) creating a high anchor point.
* **Negotiation Room:** It leaves a small margin for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Profitable:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still making significantly more than selling to John.

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. If you had more information, you might adjust the offer accordingly."
