"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $15000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer right away.  You have no information on the product's true value to Alice, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John.  By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering a price of $12,000, which is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $10,000.  While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate further.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to see if she'll come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $12,000.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make this purchase work within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12500. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, though. I'll meet you at $11500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is only $500 more than your last counteroffer. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks her walking away and leaving you with only John's option at $15,000.  It's a good deal considering your budget and the fact that Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate."
