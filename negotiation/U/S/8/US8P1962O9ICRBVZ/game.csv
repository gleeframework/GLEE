"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This price still allows for a healthy margin for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
