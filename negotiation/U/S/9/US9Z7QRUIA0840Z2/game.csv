,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still interested, but $12,500 is a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to get a good deal here. $12,750 is still higher than I'd like. I'm firm on $11,500. This is the most I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can agree.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,800?",12800.0,Alice,7,
