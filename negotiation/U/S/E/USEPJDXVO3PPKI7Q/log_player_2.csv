"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and hopefully bring the price down closer to your acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's start with this counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000.  This price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I need to continue negotiating to try and bring the price down further.  I'm confident that we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
