"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing this further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's start with this counteroffer and see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000.  This price reflects a more accurate assessment of its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value I see in the product. Let's work together to close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
