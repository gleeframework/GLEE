I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and ensures I'm making a profit over my minimum value.  I'm also considering that if Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal.  If not, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway, but if he rejects again, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting too low for my liking.  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk he'll keep lowering the price. It's safer to take the $1,000,000 from John and be done with it."
