"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents fair value for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than you think the product is worth, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
