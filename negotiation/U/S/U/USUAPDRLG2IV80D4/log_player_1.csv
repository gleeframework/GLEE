{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000, and I can get at least that from John. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $17,500. This is still above my minimum value of $15,000, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $12,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  I can get that amount from John, and I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $16,000. This is a further compromise, but it's still above my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's previous offers, and I'm hoping he will accept it."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging on his price, and I've already lowered my offer significantly.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk getting less than my minimum value.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
