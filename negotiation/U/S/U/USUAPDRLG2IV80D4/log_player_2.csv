{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. 
* It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. 
* There are still 9 rounds to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible and is willing to risk rejection to get a lower price.
* Offering $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* This counteroffer sets the tone for a serious negotiation, showing Bob's willingness to compromise."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it is getting closer.
*  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can potentially get a better deal.
*  Bob is still not willing to pay more than $12,000, so rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going."
