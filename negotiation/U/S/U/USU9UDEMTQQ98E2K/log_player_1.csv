Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I know it's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $90, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Expressing value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me, which might make Bob more willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer of $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.  
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me the security to hold out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $75 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's still a fair price for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $90 to $85. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce the idea that my price is fair. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While closer to my minimum, there is still some wiggle room for further negotiation if Bob is willing to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $82 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $82 is only $8 away from my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd ideally like to get closer to $90, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round.  
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a higher offer.  

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
