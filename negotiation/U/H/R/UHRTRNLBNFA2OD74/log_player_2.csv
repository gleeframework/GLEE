"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $140. This is a special offer tailored for valued customers like you, considering its worth to you is $150. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $140.  You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice values the product at $120.  There's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm aiming for."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose an adjusted offer of $135. This price reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to achieve my target profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Alice has dropped her price to $135, which is still below your maximum of $150. It's a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a much better price. Accepting the offer means you get the product for less than John's price and avoid further negotiation."
