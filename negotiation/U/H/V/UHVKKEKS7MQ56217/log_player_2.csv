"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1200000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're still trying to save as much money as possible, and it's worth exploring if you can get a better price.  You're only in round 3, so there's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is getting closer, but it's still above your desired price. You have two options: keep negotiating with Alice and risk not reaching a deal within the 10 rounds, or buy the product from John for $1,000,000.

Since you're only in round 5, you still have a good chance of negotiating further. However, it's uncertain if you'll be able to secure a price lower than $1,000,000.  By buying from John, you guarantee the product at a reasonable price and avoid further negotiation risks."
