"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit too much for me. How about $110? That's a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $110, which is $120. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
