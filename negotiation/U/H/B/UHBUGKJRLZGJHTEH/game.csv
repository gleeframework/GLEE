"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a bit above the market value, considering what I've researched.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the market value. However, I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,000,000? This reflects the true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $950,000? I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this easy – $975,000, and we have a deal. This product will bring you a significant return, I'm confident in that.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $960,000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe it's a fair price for the product's value and my financial constraints.",960000.0,Bob,6,
