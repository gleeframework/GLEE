"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's value to her ($8,000).  I can likely get a better price by negotiating.  There's no reason to buy from John yet, as I have 9 more rounds to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. This price is still above your value for it, and allows for some profit for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay less, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and my minimum acceptable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a significant discount from the original offer, it's still above my target price. I have 7 more rounds to negotiate, and I can likely get closer to my target of $10,000. Buying from John at this point would be a much worse outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,500.  I'm still a bit higher than my ideal price. How about $10,500? This price gives you a good profit, while still saving me some money.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering our previous offers and your latest counteroffer, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that balances my minimum acceptable price with your desire to save some money. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is just $1,000 above my ideal price of $10,000.  With only 5 rounds left, continuing to negotiate risks going over my budget or not reaching an agreement at all.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, saving me $4,000 compared to buying from John."
