Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer above that is profit.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $120 splits the difference between Bob's valuation ($150) and your minimum acceptable price ($80).  This strategy aims for a win-win situation. 

By starting the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the chances of securing a higher sale price while still leaving room for potential counter-offers."
