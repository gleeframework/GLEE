"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $100 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer him the product for $90.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $85 is lower than the minimum price I'm willing to accept ($90), I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll try to get closer to the original price I was willing to accept, so I'll offer the product for $87.50.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $85, I'll try to get a bit closer to that price. I'll offer the product for $86.
