"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. This is a great deal, considering how much value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, while Alice is willing to sell for $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation, and even at $13,500, Bob is still getting a good deal."
