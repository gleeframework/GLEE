Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $16,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the price reflects the ""true worth"",  Alice subtly implies that there's a reason behind the higher price, potentially piquing Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites a counter-offer by asking ""What do you think?"". 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** This strategy assumes Bob values the product and might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice misjudges Bob's interest, he might reject the offer outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John. This allows her to be bolder with her initial offer to Bob.

This is just one possible approach. There are other strategies Alice could employ, such as starting with a smaller markup or highlighting the product's unique benefits to justify the price."
