"Thanks for offering, Alice! I see the value in this product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal, $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a valuable product, Alice. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  That's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
