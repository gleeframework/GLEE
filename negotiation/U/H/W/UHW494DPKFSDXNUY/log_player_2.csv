"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds significant value to me. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. This price reflects its true worth while leaving room for negotiation within a reasonable range. I understand that the product's value to you is $8,000, so I hope this proposal strikes a balance that meets both our expectations. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or if you would like to make an offer. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is polite and acknowledges your valuation, $9,500 is still significantly higher than your maximum price of $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility for her to come down to a price closer to your range. If she doesn't budge, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with buying from John."
