Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit, and $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $9,500, but I'll throw in a premium service package that's worth $1,000, so the total value you'll get is $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We're getting close, but the added service package doesn't hold much value for us since we're focused on the price. Let's see if we can nudge Alice a bit further down in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really trying to keep this purchase under $9,000.  The service package is generous, but not something I need right now.  Would you consider $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I can offer you a compromise - I'll remove the premium service package, but I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, which is worth $500. This brings the total value to $9,500. I think this is a fair deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly holding firm at $9,000. While we could try to haggle further, the added warranty does offer some value. Accepting at $9,000 is a reasonable outcome, saving us $3,000 compared to John's offer."
