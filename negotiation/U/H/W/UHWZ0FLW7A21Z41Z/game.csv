"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to make a profit, and $9,000 is still a bit below my target. I can offer it to you for $9,500, but I'll throw in a premium service package that's worth $1,000, so the total value you'll get is $10,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really trying to keep this purchase under $9,000.  The service package is generous, but not something I need right now.  Would you consider $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I can offer you a compromise - I'll remove the premium service package, but I'll throw in a 1-year warranty, which is worth $500. This brings the total value to $9,500. I think this is a fair deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
