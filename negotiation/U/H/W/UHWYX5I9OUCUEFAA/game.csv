"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could be flexible, but not to that extent. Would you consider $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice. However, I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's potential and my budget constraints.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
