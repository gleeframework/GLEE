"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can come to a better agreement. How about $10000 for the product?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
