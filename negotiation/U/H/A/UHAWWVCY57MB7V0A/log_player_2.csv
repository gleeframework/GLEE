"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it incredibly useful. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $200 is way above your maximum budget of $100.  It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to jump at the first offer that's closer to my limit. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 125}
