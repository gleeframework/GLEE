# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

Bob is getting really close to my minimum price, but it's still not enough.  I've only got two rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge any further. I don't want to risk losing the deal, so I'm going to sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum price."
