"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1300000.  I'm confident this product is valuable to both of us, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1350000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings to the table.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
