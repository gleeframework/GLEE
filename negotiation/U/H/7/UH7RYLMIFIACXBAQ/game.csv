"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to own this unique item, $18,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the item's value and uniqueness.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my absolute max is $13,000.  If you're willing to consider that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm going to have to stick with my offer of $13,000. This is my absolute maximum, and if it works for you, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to explore other options.",13000.0,Bob,6,
