"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significant, and $8,000 is quite a bit below what I can consider. Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer on the price.  $12,000 is still a bit steep for my budget, but I'm willing to move up to $9,000.  That's a fair offer, considering the value I see in it.",9000.0,Bob,4,
