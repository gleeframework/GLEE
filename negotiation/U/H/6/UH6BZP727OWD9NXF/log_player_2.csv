Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $810,000.  It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking her increasing the price or reaching an impasse. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which meets your maximum budget."
