"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $820,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations.",820000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $800,000 is the very top of my budget. I'm ready to close the deal if you're able to meet that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $810,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",810000.0,Alice,5,
