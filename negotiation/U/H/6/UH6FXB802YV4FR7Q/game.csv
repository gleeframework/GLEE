"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value item that will benefit your business. My initial offer is $12,000 for the product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering your desired profit margin and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $11,500. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value and my desired profit margin.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,500. It's getting closer to what I can do.  However, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you can accept it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
