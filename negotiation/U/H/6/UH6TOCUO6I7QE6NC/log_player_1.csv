Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($800,000) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($1,000,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.
* **High Initial Offer:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also reinforces the product's high value in his mind. 

This strategy prioritizes securing the highest possible price from Bob, knowing I have a guaranteed backup offer from John."
