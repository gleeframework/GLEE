"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to us, we're offering it to you at a special price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I hope we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price you are asking is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

We start with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves us room to increase our offer in later rounds while still staying well below our $800,000 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price closer to your proposal. Therefore, I am offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a special deal considering the value it holds for both of us. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still above our budget. We should counteroffer, aiming to meet somewhere between our last offer and her current one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $760,000?"",
""product_price"": 760000
}
```

We are gradually increasing our offer, showing Alice that we are willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, falling between our previous offer and her current one, while staying below our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've reviewed your latest offer and I'm willing to negotiate further. Considering the value of the product and your interest, I propose a price of $800,000 for the product. This is the highest price I can go for now, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Alice has matched John's offer of $800,000. There's no point in negotiating further or going to John, as we won't get a better price. We should accept the offer now."
