Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your product is attractive, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It is a risk to accept Bob's offer, as I can get a higher price from John. I'll try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.
