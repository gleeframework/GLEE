"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, considering the value you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price. You have 10 rounds and John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while your product is attractive, $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value and gives you a significant discount. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. It's worth exploring a few more rounds to see if we can meet in the middle.  I'm still within my rounds and have John's offer as a backup if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs. Let's work towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a good compromise that considers both our needs and reflects the value of the product. Let's reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding out at a price higher than my target. While we're getting closer, I've only got 5 rounds left. It's getting risky to keep negotiating.  Since I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it's the most secure option at this point. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
