"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a successful deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
