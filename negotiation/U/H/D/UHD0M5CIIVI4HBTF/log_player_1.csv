Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is unlikely to go above his perceived value of $1,000,000.  Since I can secure the full $1,200,000 from John, it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiations with Bob."
