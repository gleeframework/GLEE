"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value and quality.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you considering my needs. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and quality.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality.",11250.0,Alice,5,
