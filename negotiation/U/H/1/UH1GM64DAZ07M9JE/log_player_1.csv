Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is slightly below my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept it. I will try to counteroffer and hopefully close the deal at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $1,200,000 simply isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still give you a good deal and allow me to move closer to my target price. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still sticking to his initial offer, which is well below my minimum. I'm not willing to accept it. I'll try to counteroffer again, but I'm also getting closer to considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we still have a gap. I can't go lower than $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I've already offered $1,200,000 and that's my maximum. I'm not willing to pay more than that. I'd appreciate it if you could meet me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is not willing to budge on his price, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $1,500,000."
