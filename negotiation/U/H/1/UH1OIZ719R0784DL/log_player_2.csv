"Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:**  Her language (""final offer,"" ""other interested parties"") suggests she's hit her bottom line.
* **The risk is too high:** Even if you could negotiate Alice down a little more, every dollar over $1,000,000 is a dollar lost compared to John's guaranteed price.
* **John is the safe bet:**  You have a sure thing with John at your target price. There's no need to risk overpaying with Alice in hopes of saving a relatively small amount."
