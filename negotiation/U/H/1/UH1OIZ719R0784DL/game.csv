"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. To be fair to both of us, I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but so does staying within my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say $1,050,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but to make this deal happen, I'd need it to be $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested parties.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
