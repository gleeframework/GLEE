"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $20,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a fair offer considering its worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe that $10,000 is the most I can realistically pay for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",10000.0,Bob,4,
