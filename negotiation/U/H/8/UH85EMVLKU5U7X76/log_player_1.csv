# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep the cost closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum acceptable price and ensures a sale.  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result."
