Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds immense value for you, and I believe a price of $1,500,000 reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential price ceiling. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects it, you can lower the price, potentially still exceeding your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while considering the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
