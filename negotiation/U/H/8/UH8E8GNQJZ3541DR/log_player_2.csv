"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be valuable to you at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low a price as possible. While $950,000 is lower than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it brings, we're willing to negotiate further. Our counteroffer for the product is $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is lower than the previous offer, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000.  He can potentially get the product for the same price from John, so there's no need to settle now.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to compromise. Our counteroffer for the product is $887,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob.  While it's a bit higher than John's price,  Alice is now very close to Bob's budget and it's possible that they won't get much lower. There's a risk of going to the next round and Alice rejecting Bob's counteroffer, which could lead to a higher price or a deal falling through.  It's better to accept the offer now and secure the product at a reasonable price."
