Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your minimum selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""special introductory price,"" you create a sense of time sensitivity and imply that the price might increase later.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By offering it at $120, you are leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer that might still be above your minimum price of $100. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives you leverage. You can walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it doesn't meet your needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value ($80). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price.  You'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic is often perceived as fair and can help move negotiations forward. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $90, you're still above your minimum ($100) but closer to Bob's perceived value ($80).
* **Highlighting Value:** Re-emphasizing the product's value keeps Bob focused on the benefits rather than just the price.

We'll see how Bob responds to this counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is a bit closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to your minimum price, $70 is still below what you're willing to accept.  You're better off seeing if you can negotiate a bit further before accepting a loss or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't let this product go for less than its worth. My final offer is $85.  I think that's a very reasonable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you're signaling to Bob that this is the limit of your flexibility.
* **Justification:** Reiterate that the price is tied to the product's inherent value.
* **Slight Concession:** You're slightly lowering your price to entice Bob while staying above your absolute minimum. 

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Acceptance:** Bob might recognize this as a good deal and accept. 
2. **Walking Away:** If Bob rejects this, you're better off taking John's guaranteed offer of $100 rather than going any lower."
