"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product offers.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 is a bit closer, but still a little high for my budget. How about $70? That's a fair compromise, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't let this product go for less than its worth. My final offer is $85.  I think that's a very reasonable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",85.0,Alice,5,
