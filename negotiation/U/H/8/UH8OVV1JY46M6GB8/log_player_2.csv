"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob, but $60 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I believe that's a fair price considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I can't let this product go for less than its worth. My final offer is $85.  I think that's a very reasonable price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower.  While $85 is a better price than her original offer, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $80. It makes more sense to stick to your budget and buy from John."
