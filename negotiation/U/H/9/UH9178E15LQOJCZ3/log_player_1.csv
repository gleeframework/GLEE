Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $175. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get the highest price possible. Since the product is worth $150 to both of us, starting higher gives me room to negotiate or still get a good deal with John if Bob refuses.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation. He might counter-offer, and we can settle on a price between $150 and $175.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm not losing out.  I can sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
