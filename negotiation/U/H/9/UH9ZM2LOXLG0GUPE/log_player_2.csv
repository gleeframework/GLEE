"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, but $95 is too close to that limit.
* **Negotiating is worth a try.**  There's room for Alice to lower the price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to meet in the middle. How about $90? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is reasonable.** While you'd prefer a lower price, $90 is a good compromise. It's still within your budget and significantly lower than her initial offer.
* **There's no guarantee of a better deal.** You might be able to negotiate further, but there's a risk Alice will become unwilling to sell. 
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate could waste time, and John might not be available later.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice in this situation."
