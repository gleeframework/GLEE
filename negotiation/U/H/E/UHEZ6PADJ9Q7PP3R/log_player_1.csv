Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $115, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is more than $100, giving Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still more than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit. 
* **It's a clear message:** The message is friendly and explains the price point, inviting Bob to start the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
