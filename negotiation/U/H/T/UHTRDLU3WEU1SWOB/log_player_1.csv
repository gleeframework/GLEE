Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value the product holds for me and the price you're asking.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's perspective, but I still feel that $1,075,000 is a bit high. Considering the value the product holds for me, I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum. However, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially losing out on a better deal. I'm confident I can sell to John for a higher price, so I'm going to sell to John."
