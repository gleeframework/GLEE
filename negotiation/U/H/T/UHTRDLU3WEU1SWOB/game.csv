"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value the product holds for me and the price you're asking.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000?  This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while also allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's perspective, but I still feel that $1,075,000 is a bit high. Considering the value the product holds for me, I would like to propose a price of $1,060,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
