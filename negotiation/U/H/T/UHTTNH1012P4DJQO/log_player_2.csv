This is a tough one! Alice is clearly holding firm, and while there's a chance to negotiate further, it's risky. Here's why accepting is the best option now:

* **Minimal Savings Potential:**  Even if you got Alice down to $1,025,000 in further rounds, the savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away.
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:** Alice is using strong language. There's a good chance she won't budge further and you'll be stuck with John's much higher price.
* **Time Constraint:** You're over halfway through the rounds.  Continuing the dance increases the likelihood of running out of time and defaulting to John's offer. 

While $1,075,000 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
