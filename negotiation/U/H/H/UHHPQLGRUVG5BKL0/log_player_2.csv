"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10,000 to you. I am proposing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a special offer tailored just for you, considering the value this product holds for you. I believe this price reflects its true worth while also providing you with an excellent opportunity to acquire it. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. You know it's worth no more than $10,000, and John is willing to sell it at that price. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This might lead her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $8,000. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $10,000 â€“ it's better to save $500."
