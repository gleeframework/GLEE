``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below my minimum value of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and allows for a possible profit if Bob accepts. It also shows I'm willing to negotiate, which can be beneficial in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum value, and I am not willing to sell it for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit shy of that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While Bob's offer of $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable selling for. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'm really interested in the product, but I think I can get a better price from someone else. I'm willing to make one last offer: $8,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob has clearly stated his final offer and I am not willing to go any lower.  It's time to move on and sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
