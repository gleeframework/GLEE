"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, $10,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal. ",10800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to find a way to make this work for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,250? This would allow me to purchase the product while still staying within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and I want to make this work, but $10,250 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal. ",10500.0,Alice,5,
