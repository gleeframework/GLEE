Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations seem to be stalled. Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I am hesitant to drop below $950,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it is more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures a quick and secure sale with no further negotiation headaches."
