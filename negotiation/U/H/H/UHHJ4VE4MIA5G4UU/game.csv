"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product that's worth its weight in gold. It's a game-changer for anyone in your industry, and I believe it could be a cornerstone of your future success.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,200,000, reflecting the value it brings. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's talk!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my initial price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's worth and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your initial offer. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit below the value I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about we settle at $975,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a little below what I believe this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and settle at $950,000.  This compromise ensures a mutually beneficial deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,8,
