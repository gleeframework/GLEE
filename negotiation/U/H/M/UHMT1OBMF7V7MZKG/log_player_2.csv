Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  We're getting closer! How about we split the difference and go with $81?  It's only a few dollars away from your last offer, and it's a good compromise. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice is unlikely to go below $80, and at this point, it's more efficient to take the guaranteed deal from John."
