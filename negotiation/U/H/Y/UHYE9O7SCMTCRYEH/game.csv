"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,075,000 is a significant compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,100,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to accept for this product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
