Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $110 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. It's a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but the ""special price"" framing might make it more appealing. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity to purchase, I create a sense of urgency and potential loss aversion, which might encourage him to accept the offer."
