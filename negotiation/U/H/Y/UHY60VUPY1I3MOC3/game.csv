"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $900,000 is a step closer, it's still not quite in the range I need to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the product's value while still being fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $950,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  $1,000,000 is my final offer. This reflects the value of the product while still being a fair price for both of us.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll be moving on to another buyer.  Let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
