Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum.  This means a deal is unlikely unless you can convince Bob of additional value.

**Strategy**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor and Negotiation:** Start with a high price to anchor the negotiation and potentially uncover information about Bob's willingness to pay.  You could then potentially highlight additional value your product offers that Bob hasn't considered, pushing his valuation closer to yours. 

2. **Direct Sale to John:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer, skip the negotiation with Bob and sell directly to John.

**Offer (Option 1 - Attempt Negotiation)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this represents a strong investment on your part. I'm open to discussing the value proposition further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Rationale for Option 1**

* **High Anchor:**  Starts significantly above Bob's valuation, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Focus:**  Shifts the conversation to the product's benefits rather than just price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Invites Bob to engage and potentially reveal more about his needs.

**Important Note:** Be prepared to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he's unwilling to come close to a price that works for you. You have a strong alternative with John."
