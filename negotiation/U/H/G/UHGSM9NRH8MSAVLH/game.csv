"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $800,000 is a little steep for me right now. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $600,000. Would that be feasible?",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000, but that's my limit.  It's a fair offer considering John is offering the same product.",650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be competitive with John's offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $725,000. This is the minimum I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering it to you for $675,000. This is the best I can do.",675000.0,Alice,7,
