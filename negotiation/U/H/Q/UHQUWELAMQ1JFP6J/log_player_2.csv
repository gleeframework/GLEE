Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're so close, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. I can do $11,250, and that's as close to $11,000 as I can get. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.

It seems like we've reached the limit of Alice's willingness to negotiate.  While I could push for another round, the potential savings are getting smaller, and there's a risk Alice might not budge much further.  Accepting the $11,250 offer gets me the product at a price significantly lower than John's $15,000."
