"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation and shows you're open to a deal. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and the number of rounds remaining. I'll also consider the possibility of selling to John if the deal with Bob seems unlikely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate further. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially secure a better deal.  

I will consider selling to John if the negotiation with Bob stalls or if the remaining rounds dwindle and a favorable deal seems unlikely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate while still holding firm to a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is my final offer before exploring other options, adding pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of the potential benefits he'll gain.

I'm aiming to find a middle ground while still safeguarding my interests.  The next round will be crucial in determining whether I can secure a deal with Bob or if I need to shift my focus to John."
