"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his maximum budget.  Considering she stated it's her final offer, and Bob is within 5% of his limit, it's better to accept and close the deal.  There's a risk of further negotiation, potentially resulting in a lower price, but also a risk of losing the deal completely if Alice sticks to her final offer and Bob rejects it.  In this scenario, accepting provides a better chance of getting the product within a reasonable range."
