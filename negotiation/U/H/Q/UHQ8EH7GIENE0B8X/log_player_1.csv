Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's perfect for you. I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.
* **""open to negotiation"":** This signals flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **""perfect for you"":** This adds a personal touch and subtly reinforces the product's value to Bob.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also starting a dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $60.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me. Therefore, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is far too low.  It's clear we're both passionate about this product, so let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $120 is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually acceptable price, highlighting that both of us value the product.
* **Reasoning:** I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not going to accept a price that significantly undervalues my product. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation going while pushing for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference closer to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below my desired value.  I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal while maintaining my own bottom line.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  The offer of $105 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of the offer, highlighting that it benefits both of us.

This counteroffer aims to find a mutually agreeable price while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've come down quite a bit and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to budge a little more, how about we settle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made several concessions and it seems unlikely that Bob will come up much higher. I've also been through several rounds of negotiation, which is time-consuming.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a price that meets my minimum requirement and ensures a quicker sale."
