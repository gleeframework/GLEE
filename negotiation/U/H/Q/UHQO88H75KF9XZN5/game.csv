"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value this product brings.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,750.  Would you consider $13,500?  That's a fair price for us both and would allow us to finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
