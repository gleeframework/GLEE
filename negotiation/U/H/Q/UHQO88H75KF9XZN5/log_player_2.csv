"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its features and your specific needs. I'm initially proposing a price of $14,500. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,500 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs. However, $14,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than Alice's minimum value, showing a willingness to negotiate.  This gives Bob a good chance of closing the deal at a price closer to his target.  The counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, indicating to Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $13,750 is closer to Bob's target price, he can still try to get a lower price by rejecting Alice's offer and making another counteroffer.  Bob is also aware that he can always buy from John, giving him some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $13,750.  Would you consider $13,500?  That's a fair price for us both and would allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his target. He's offering a slight increase from his previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying below Alice's counteroffer.  This move shows Alice that Bob is serious about closing the deal while still trying to save money."
