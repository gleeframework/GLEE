Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its potential."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more. 
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($15,000 vs. $10,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you don't lose out.

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, more back-and-forth communication might lead to a different optimal strategy."
