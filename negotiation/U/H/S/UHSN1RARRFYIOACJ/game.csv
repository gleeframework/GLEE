"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is of high value, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more manageable for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more manageable price, but I have to make a profit. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to reach at least $1,080,000 to make it worthwhile. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
