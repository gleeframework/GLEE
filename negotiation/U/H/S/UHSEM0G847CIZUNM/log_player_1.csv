Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $8,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if you're open to negotiation.

This represents a fair compromise and allows us to both reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.
