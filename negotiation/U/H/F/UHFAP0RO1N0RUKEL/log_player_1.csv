"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a good price.  If he rejects, I'll adjust based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can push for more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to land somewhere between his offer and my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm adjusting my price downward to be more competitive, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial asking price. I'm hoping that by meeting him halfway, Bob will be more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, it's a good deal and securing the sale is important."
