"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I believe it's a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,800 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,600.  Let's get this deal done.",10600.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,200 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and it's a great deal for you considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
