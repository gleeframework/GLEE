"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is better than $100, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he's offering $85. This is closer to Alice's value of $80, making the offer more appealing.
* **Negotiation tone:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation.  Bob acknowledges Alice's offer but suggests a different price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Price:**  The product is worth $100 to Bob. While Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than her valuation, it's a good deal for Bob, considering he's saving $10 compared to buying from John.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  There's a chance that Bob could negotiate further, but the risk is that Alice might walk away, leaving him with no product or a higher price from John. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation will take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
