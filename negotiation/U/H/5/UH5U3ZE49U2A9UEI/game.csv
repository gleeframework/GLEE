"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we split the difference and agree on $9,000? It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement quickly. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit above my target price, so I'd like to make another offer. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to try to get as close to my target price as possible. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $9,250. That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
