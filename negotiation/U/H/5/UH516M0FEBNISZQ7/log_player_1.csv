Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could tap into.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's less than his $1,200,000 valuation) but also maximizes your profit.  

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:**  $1,150,000 is a significant chunk below Bob's perceived value, making it likely he'll accept.
* **Maximizes Profit:** This price nets you an extra $150,000 compared to John's offer.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He might counter-offer, or he might be willing to pay even more than $1,150,000. This offer is a strong starting point for the negotiation."
