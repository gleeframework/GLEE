"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $95? I'm really looking for a good deal.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $95 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,
