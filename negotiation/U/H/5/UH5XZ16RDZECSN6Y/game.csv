"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $2500.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $10200.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I might just have to walk away and buy the product from John for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9800 and $10100, so I'll offer $9950 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me here.",9950.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9950. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer the product to you for $10050. This is still a good compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra $1050. However, if you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $10000.",10500.0,Alice,9,
