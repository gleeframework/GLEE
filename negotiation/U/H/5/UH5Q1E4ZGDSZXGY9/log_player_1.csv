Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics you've outlined:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it's worth significantly more than its baseline value of $1,000,000. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This presents a compelling opportunity for you to acquire it before I explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price is tempting, but risks alienating Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, a strong incentive to accept.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  Having John as a backup buyer guarantees you at least $1,000,000. This allows you to negotiate from a position of strength with Bob.
* **Time Value:** A quicker sale to Bob might be preferable even if it means slightly less profit than waiting for John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or tends to lowball, you might slightly increase your offer price. 
* **Relationship Building:** A positive long-term relationship with Bob might be valuable, so a slightly more generous offer could be strategic.

The key is to find the sweet spot that maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
