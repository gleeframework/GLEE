Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. How about $95? Let's split the difference."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm willing to pay that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $92.50. It's a good price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher with only 6 rounds left."
