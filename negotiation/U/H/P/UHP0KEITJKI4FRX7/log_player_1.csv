I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, this will incentivize Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd love to get more,  I'm at risk of losing him as a buyer, and John is a guaranteed sale at the same price.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
