"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price.  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is a better price than $1,000,000, it's still above your ideal target. There's room to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to your goal."
