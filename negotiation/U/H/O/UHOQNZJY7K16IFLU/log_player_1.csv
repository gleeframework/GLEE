"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $60 is too low for me. How about we settle at $100? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $70. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

```

Explanation:  Bob is stubbornly refusing to go above $70.  Since we have a guaranteed offer of $80 from John, it makes no sense to continue haggling with Bob. It's time to take the guaranteed profit."
