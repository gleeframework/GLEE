{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500** is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation and still offers Bob a good deal as he values the product at $12,000. 
* **The message** is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to give up so much profit yet. I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $11,500. I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,150** is a compromise. It's halfway between my initial offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,800.
* **The message** is still friendly and acknowledges Bob's offer while pushing for a higher price. It emphasizes fairness to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your proposal, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,950. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,950 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price, and there's a risk that he'll walk away completely. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
