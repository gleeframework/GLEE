Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it is significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

By starting high, I hope to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher price. If Bob rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and how much I believe the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price that low.  I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $12,000. This is a compromise, still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a fair profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum value and a significant increase from his previous offer. Accepting this offer is the best choice as it guarantees a sale and a profit. While I could potentially get a higher price if I keep negotiating, there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to raise his offer, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Additionally, selling to John for $10,000 would be a lower profit."
