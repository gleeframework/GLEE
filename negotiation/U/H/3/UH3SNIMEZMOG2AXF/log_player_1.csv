"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll come close to $15,000 without significant negotiation.
