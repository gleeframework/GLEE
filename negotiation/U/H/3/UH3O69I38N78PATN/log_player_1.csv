"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a higher profit margin.  While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I believe he's likely to negotiate. This initial offer leaves room for compromise and ensures I'm not leaving any potential gains on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can secure a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. It's risky to accept at this point, as I'm still within the range where I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe Bob values the product at this amount, and I'm willing to meet his valuation. This is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll be happy to sell the product to John for the same amount."
