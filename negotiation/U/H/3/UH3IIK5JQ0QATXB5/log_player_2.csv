Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.

You have three options:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $76. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $84. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her original price and seems unwilling to budge much. It's likely she won't go much lower than $82.  We can push a little further, but it's time to start considering John's offer if the next round doesn't yield a significant price drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $84 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78, but that's my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're putting a little pressure on Alice now by introducing a ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other options."" This might nudge her to make a bigger concession, especially if she's eager to close the deal.  We're still in a good spot to walk away if needed and go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the sweet spot, and I appreciate your honesty about your final offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has increased her price! It's clear she's not negotiating in good faith and is unlikely to offer a price I'm willing to accept. It's time to cut my losses and go with John. While I'll pay a bit more, it's better than wasting more time haggling with Alice."
