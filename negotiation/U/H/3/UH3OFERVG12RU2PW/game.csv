"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal at $9,500. It's still a great value for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product at $9,500 is too low, but I can meet you at $9,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. My final offer is $9,250.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",9250.0,Bob,6,
