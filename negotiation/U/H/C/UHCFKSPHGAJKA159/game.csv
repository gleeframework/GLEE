"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product but would be happy to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is a great compromise that I think you'll find hard to pass up.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $110, which is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to accept this.",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $120. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $117. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",117.0,Alice,5,
