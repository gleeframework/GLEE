"Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This is a significant investment for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile one.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,475,000.

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I can't go any lower than $1,500,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the potential for profit. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'm prepared to sell it to John.  The decision is yours.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

I'm willing to meet you at $1,475,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm also considering buying the product from John for $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,475,000, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1475000.0,Bob,6,
