"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 to me. Could you lower your price closer to that?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, how about we meet halfway and settle for $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $10,500 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant offer on my part.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  However,  $7,000 is too low. Let's settle this right now - how about $9,000? This offer stands until the end of the next round.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like. I can do $8,000, my final offer. That's the highest I can go. ",8000.0,Bob,6,
