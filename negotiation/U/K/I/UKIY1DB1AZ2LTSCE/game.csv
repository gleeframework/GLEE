"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to get the product you need.",12000.0,Alice,5,
