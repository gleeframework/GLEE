"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Even though Alice is trying to make it seem like a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum price. He can get the product for $12,000 from John, which is a much better deal."
