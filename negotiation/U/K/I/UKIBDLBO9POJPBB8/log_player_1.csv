Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to get a price closer to my minimum.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further discussion. 
* **Opportunity to close:**  I reiterate my willingness to find a solution that benefits both of us, implying that a deal is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $92.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $92.50 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rather than risk losing Bob completely or selling to John for $100, it makes sense to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
