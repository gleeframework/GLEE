"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits. Can you consider my offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
