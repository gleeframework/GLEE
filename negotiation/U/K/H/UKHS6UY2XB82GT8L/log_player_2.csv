**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, given the exceptional quality and unique features of our product, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $1,050,000. Our initial proposal was based on a thorough evaluation of the product's value, and we believe it's worth $1,200,000. We are open to discussing further to find a mutually agreeable price, but we would like to propose a revised offer of $1,150,000. This price reflects a compromise that still acknowledges the product's worth while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $1,150,000 is significantly lower than the $1,500,000 John is asking.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Alice has already lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000. Further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. 

While Bob wants to save as much as possible, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice in this situation."
