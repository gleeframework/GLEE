"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your consideration, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, given the exceptional quality and unique features of our product, I must respectfully decline your counteroffer of $1,050,000. Our initial proposal was based on a thorough evaluation of the product's value, and we believe it's worth $1,200,000. We are open to discussing further to find a mutually agreeable price, but we would like to propose a revised offer of $1,150,000. This price reflects a compromise that still acknowledges the product's worth while considering your budget constraints.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
