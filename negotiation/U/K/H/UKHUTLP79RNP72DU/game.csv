"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  How about $10,000?  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a price closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
