"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way more than I'm willing to spend. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a limit. How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still much higher than I can justify.  To be honest, anything above $800,000 is a real stretch for me.  How about we try $700,000 and see if we can bridge this gap?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  However, the value of this product is substantial. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $1,500,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
