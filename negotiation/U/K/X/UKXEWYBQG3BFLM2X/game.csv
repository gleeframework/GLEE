"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $11500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $12250? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11750 to show you I want to reach an agreement.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",11750.0,Alice,5,
