"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price. I have 9 more rounds, so I have time to negotiate.  $1,500,000 is my minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $2,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe this product holds significant value. Let's split the difference - how about $1,750,000?  I'm confident you'll see the returns on this investment."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1375000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I have 6 rounds left, so I'm not in a rush to settle.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can come to a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000 at this point.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1550000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1450000 and $1550000, so how about $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get more than $1,500,000, I only have two rounds left. If Bob rejects this offer, I risk ending up with nothing if I can't reach a deal in the next round.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum, so accepting Bob's offer is the safest choice at this point."
