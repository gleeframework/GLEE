"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to the market value as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I believe this reflects the true value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'd love to hear your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is now above John's offer, so it makes sense to accept and maximize profit."
