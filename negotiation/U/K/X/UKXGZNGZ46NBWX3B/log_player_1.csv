Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I open the offer to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for him to see it as a ""good deal"" compared to my alternative buyer.
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers, I'm subtly pressuring Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid ""missing out."""
