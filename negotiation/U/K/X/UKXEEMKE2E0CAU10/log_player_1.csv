Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is justified.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  Indicating a willingness to discuss the price makes Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering and keeps the dialogue open. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob. It weakens your negotiating position. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
