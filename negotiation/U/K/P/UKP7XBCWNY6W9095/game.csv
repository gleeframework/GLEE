"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50, but that's as low as I can go.",92.5,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but $91 is still a bit much.  How about we split the difference and settle on $89?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I can close the deal right now.",89.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? It's just a dollar more than your last offer, and I think it's worth it for the value this product brings.",90.0,Alice,7,
