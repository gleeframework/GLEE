"Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
