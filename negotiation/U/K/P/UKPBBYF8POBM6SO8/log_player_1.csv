Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $125, which is halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $100 and the estimated value to Bob ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I make a profit. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a potential win-win for Bob, highlighting the product's value to him.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll keep John's offer of $100 in mind as a safety net, as I can always sell to him if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, but it's not ideal. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly values the product at $150, so there's a gap between our positions.
* **Selling to John:** While John offers a guaranteed $100, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob before settling.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $125.  I'll keep in mind that if the negotiations fail, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a compromise. How about $115? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($100). 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to consider a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Continuation:** I'm keeping the conversation open for further negotiation, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a decent price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm glad we are getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob's offer of $110 is a significant improvement from his previous offer of $100. We're now very close to my desired price range. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $10, which is better than selling to John for $100. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and move on to other opportunities."
