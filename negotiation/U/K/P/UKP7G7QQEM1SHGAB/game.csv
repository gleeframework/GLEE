"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth.  Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
