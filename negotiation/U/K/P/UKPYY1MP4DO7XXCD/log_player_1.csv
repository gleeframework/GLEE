"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its true worth.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above the value to Bob ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is direct and friendly, expressing the value of the product and leaving the door open for discussion. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation before resorting to John's offer or making a counteroffer if Bob rejects this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but I'm not willing to go above $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $725,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($800,000).**  While it's closer than his initial rejection, it's still too far off.
* **More negotiation is possible.**  There's still room for me to counter-offer and try to bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet.**  While John offers my minimum, I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $762,500?  That would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of rejecting outright, I'm offering a counteroffer that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still hold onto a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Focus on a win-win:**  The message emphasizes the ""split the difference"" approach to highlight a potential for both parties to benefit.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** This counteroffer shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $725,000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'd like to make a final offer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  He's unwilling to budge further, and I'm not willing to accept a loss on my product.
* **Time is running out.**  We've already had three rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk further rounds that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **John offers a guaranteed deal.**  While I'd prefer to get more from Bob, selling to John provides a secure and acceptable outcome.

Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum value and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might result in a lower price."
