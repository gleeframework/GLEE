"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal.",890000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $820,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",820000.0,Bob,4,
