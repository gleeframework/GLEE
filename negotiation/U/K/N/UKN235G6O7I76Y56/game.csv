"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.
