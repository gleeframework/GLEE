Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. This helps build rapport and makes him more likely to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* **High starting price:** This allows for more potential negotiation space.
* **Appeal to Bob's interests:** By mentioning the value to him, I'm increasing his motivation to negotiate.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers, which shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **John as a safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not pressured into accepting a bad deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to settle for a price that low, especially since I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum.

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range. This shows I'm serious about getting a fair price and allows for further negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum gives me the confidence to reject offers that are too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a counteroffer at $950,000, which is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000 but still within Bob's potential budget.
* **Reasoning:** I explain to Bob that the price is still a good value for him, emphasizing the benefits of the product. 
* **Negotiation:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Safety Net:** I'm confident I can get a better price with John, which gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving the Goalposts:** I'm aiming to gradually increase the price towards my desired point.
* **Transparency:**  I'm being honest with Bob about my needs, which builds trust.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm continuously reminding Bob of the value the product offers him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $925,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000. 

**Strategy:**

* **Continue Negotiation:**  I will continue the negotiation with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the confidence to reject offers that don't meet my minimum requirements. 
* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will counter with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but potentially more acceptable to him."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $920,000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $800,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,200,000.  It's not worth risking getting a lower price with Bob, especially since John's offer is significantly better.

**Strategy:**

* **Safety Net:**  John's offer provides a secure fallback option, ensuring I receive my minimum desired price.
* **Time is Money:** Further negotiation with Bob is likely to be time-consuming and may not result in a better outcome. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting John's offer minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price than expected."
