"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still represents a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $925,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $975,000. This represents a fair compromise, and it's still a fantastic deal for you considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $920,000. If you're not willing to accept this, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $800,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",920000.0,Bob,6,
