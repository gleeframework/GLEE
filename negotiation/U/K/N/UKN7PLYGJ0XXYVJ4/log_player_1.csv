Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to my limit, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $8,700. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need you to meet me at $8,700. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

This is a tough decision, but given the limited rounds remaining, it's better to secure the $10,000 from John.  I'm not confident I can get Bob to agree to a higher price within the remaining two rounds."
