Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($120). 
* **Create Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to make a decision.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting slightly higher leaves a sliver of room if Bob attempts to negotiate down.

It's important to note that this is a single-round negotiation. There's no opportunity to adjust the price based on Bob's response."
