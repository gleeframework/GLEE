"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1600000 is still a bit out of my budget.

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000.
