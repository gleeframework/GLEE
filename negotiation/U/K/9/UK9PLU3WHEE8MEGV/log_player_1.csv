"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This allows some room for negotiation while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $125. This shows flexibility while still being within my minimum acceptable value.  I hope this encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied.  I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to my absolute minimum acceptable price of $120. This demonstrates a commitment to reaching a deal with Bob, while still ensuring I don't sell the product for less than it's worth to me."
