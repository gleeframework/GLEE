"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? That feels like a fairer price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This gives us both a fair deal.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, it's still a touch high for me.  How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $750,000 is still too low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that. I'm ready to make this happen.  How about $780,000?  If that works for you, we have a deal.",780000.0,Bob,6,
