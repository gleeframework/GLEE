"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly.  How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still not comfortable going below $100. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $95. It's a great price, and I think you'll really like the product!",95.0,Alice,5,
