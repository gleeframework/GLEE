Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my current financial constraints, I'd like to offer you $1,300,000. This is a substantial amount and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I'm also prepared to walk away if this isn't acceptable.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
