Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is still significantly below my minimum of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to take the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's tempting to accept $800,000,  it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he's shown interest and is willing to pay more than his initial valuation. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** Having John's offer of $1,000,000 gives me strong leverage during negotiations.

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize why $850,000 is a fair price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm still open to negotiation and leaving room for Bob to counteroffer again. This keeps the door open for a successful deal. 

**Important Note:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still keeping John's $1,000,000 offer in mind as my fallback option."
