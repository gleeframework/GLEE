"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,750? It's a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $12,750 is a better price than John's offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's room for more negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down further."
