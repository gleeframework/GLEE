"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, it seems like we are getting closer.  While $950,000 is more reasonable, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,000,000? It's a strong offer that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
