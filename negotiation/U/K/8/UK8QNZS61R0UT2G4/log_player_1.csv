Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. A price of $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Focus on value, not just price:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept your offer."
