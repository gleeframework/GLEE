"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150.**  You can do better.
* **There's no immediate need to buy from John.** You have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the offer by $20 is a significant step, but still leaves room for negotiation.**
* **The message is friendly and respectful, maintaining a good relationship.**
* **This counteroffer is within your budget and hopefully makes Alice reconsider her offer.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $110 is within your budget of $150.**  It's a good price considering your initial counteroffer of $100.
* **There's no need to risk further negotiation.**  You've already gotten a decent discount, and the price is reasonable. 
* **Continuing to negotiate could lead to Alice rejecting your counteroffer again, wasting time.**"
