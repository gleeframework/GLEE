{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not too far off to scare him away. I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible, but also want to leave room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price. I'll reject it and try to counter-offer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm offering a counter-offer of $140, which is still above my minimum price but shows flexibility. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground and entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept as it's below my desired price. I'll reject and counter-offer again, trying to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm offering a compromise with $135, which is only $5 away from Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this will be the sweet spot to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds and I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below my desired price. I've reached a point where I'm confident that Bob won't go much higher, and I'm not willing to go lower. Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum price and guarantees a good deal for me."
