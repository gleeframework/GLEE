"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11000? It's still a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away happy. ",11000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that $11000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $9500. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal, and I respect that. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250?  It's a fair price, and it's a step closer to where we both need to be.  What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $10250. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the price I was initially considering when I looked at the product. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,6,,
