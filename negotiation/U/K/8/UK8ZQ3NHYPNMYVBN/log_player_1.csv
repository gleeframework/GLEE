"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's a valuable item, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $11,000? It's still a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away happy. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still not convinced that $11000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push Bob a little further, especially since I have more rounds to negotiate.  There's always the option of selling to John for $10,000, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal, and I respect that. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  It's a fair price, and it's a step closer to where we both need to be.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $10250. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, which is the price I was initially considering when I looked at the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk running out of time.  Selling to John for the same price is a sure thing.  It's time to take the deal!"
