"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1000000. I think it's a fair offer considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that exact price, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price."
