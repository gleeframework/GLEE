"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
