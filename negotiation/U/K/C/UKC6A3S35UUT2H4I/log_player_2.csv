"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $12,000 to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is fair to both parties.  A price of $8,500 is a good starting point for a counteroffer. This is still significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's higher than what the product is worth to Alice, giving her a reason to consider it. Bob is also leaving some room for negotiation, as he is willing to pay more than $8,000 but still wants to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her initial offer, it is still too high for Bob.  He can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  The product is still worth more to Bob than it is to Alice, so there is still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's raised his offer from $8,500 to $9,000, showing he's willing to compromise. This is still lower than Alice's offer, but it's closer to her desired price point, making it more likely she'll accept.  It's also significantly lower than what Bob would pay John, making it a good deal for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to the price Bob would pay John, and the negotiating is becoming tiresome.  Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and he is not willing to pay more than that, even for a slightly lower price. While he is willing to negotiate, he would rather purchase the product from John at $12,000 rather than continue with the current round of negotiation."
