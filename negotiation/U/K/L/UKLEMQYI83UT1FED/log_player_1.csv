"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and it's a strong opening position.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction to this initial offer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $18,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above his initial offer. Hopefully, this will push the price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is getting close to my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting Bob's offer at $17,000 is a good outcome, considering I have a guaranteed fallback option with John."
