"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $85. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a great price for a product of this quality, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90, and I think that's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet at $98? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",98.0,Alice,5,
