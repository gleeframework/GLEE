{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy for $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a faster sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above $1,100,000. This ensures Alice makes a significant profit beyond her minimum.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much back and forth."
