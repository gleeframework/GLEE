"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget. It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting strong by offering the minimum he's willing to pay, which is his fallback price with John. This establishes a clear baseline and puts pressure on Alice to come down. While Alice might reject this initial offer, it's a necessary step to initiate a serious negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,500,000 is still above Bob's preferred price point.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better deal. There's a good chance Alice will need to come down further to secure a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now raising his offer slightly from $1,000,000 to $1,250,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still aiming for a price that's a good value for him. This counteroffer is a compromise,  showing flexibility while still keeping the price below his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has dropped the price to $1,400,000, which is closer to Bob's budget. However,  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. The key is to maintain a balance between pushing for a better deal and not risking losing the opportunity altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise,  showing Alice he's serious about the deal while still keeping it under his maximum price. This counteroffer puts more pressure on Alice to come down to a price that's mutually agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $1,350,000. This is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,300,000. Given that only three rounds remain, accepting this offer makes sense:

* **Value:** While not the absolute minimum, this price is still a good value for Bob.
* **Time:** Continuing the negotiation for a few more rounds might save a few thousand dollars, but it risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not make any further concessions. This would leave him with the option of buying from John at $1,000,000, which is significantly better than the potential of being left empty-handed. 

By accepting this offer, Bob secures the product within his budget and minimizes the risk of losing out on a valuable opportunity."
