Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $150. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation or a counter-offer from Bob.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies value by mentioning a ""limited time"" and ""special price,"" which might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob rejects the $150 offer, there's a chance he might counter-offer with a price higher than $120, getting Alice closer to her desired profit.  

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you know about Bob (e.g., is he price-sensitive?), you might choose a different approach."
