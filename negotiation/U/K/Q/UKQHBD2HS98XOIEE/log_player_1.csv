Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate the compromise you've shown. I'm willing to go down slightly to $1,325,000.

``` 

Bob's offer of $1,310,000 is getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's only slightly lower than my last counteroffer and we've reached a compromise. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and ending up with John's offer of $1,000,000."
