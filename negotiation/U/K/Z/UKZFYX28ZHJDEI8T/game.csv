"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate, how about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $110 is a bit steep given my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $95? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still expressing interest in your product.",95.0,Bob,4,
