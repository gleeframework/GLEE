"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000. This product is worth $10,000 to you, so I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. Let's make this deal happen!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $11,500?  This would be a fair compromise and would still give you a good profit.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $11,500 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a deal you won't regret! Let's finalize this.",12500.0,Alice,5,
