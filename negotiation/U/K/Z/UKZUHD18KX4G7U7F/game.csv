"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable,  $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. I would be willing to pay $700,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for us, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which is still a significant discount from the original value of the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you and our costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a substantial investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below our target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $800,000, which is the lowest we can go without sacrificing our profit margin. This is a final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
