Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a reasonable price:**  It's less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It's above your minimum:** It ensures you make a profit.
* **It opens the door to negotiation:** It invites Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to potentially get closer to the $120 value. 

If Bob rejects, you can then assess his counteroffer and decide if you want to continue negotiating or sell to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $85 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is more than selling to John, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You're likely to get closer to your goal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  A counteroffer allows you to test his willingness to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

This counteroffer is strategically placed:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial asking price. This shows you're willing to meet halfway.
* **It's still profitable:**  It ensures you earn more than selling to John.
* **It keeps the negotiation moving:** It encourages Bob to consider a higher price and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to offer $90 for it. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than John's offer and it gets you closer to your desired profit margin.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get you even closer to $100, but there's a risk that Bob will walk away.  Accepting his offer ensures a good deal for both of you."
