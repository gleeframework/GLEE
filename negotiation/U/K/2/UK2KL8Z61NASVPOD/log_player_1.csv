"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was wondering if you could lower the price to $150? I understand the value of the product, but I'm working within a specific budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to stick to your minimum acceptable price. You know John is willing to pay $150, which matches your baseline. There's no guarantee Bob will go any higher, and further negotiation could be fruitless. Accepting John's offer ensures you get a fair price without the risk of prolonged haggling."
