{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $130 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm friendly and upbeat, highlighting the value for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest without giving away too much. If he rejects, I can still adjust my counteroffers. If he accepts, I've secured a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the most I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below what I initially offered him.
* **Selling to John is the best option.** I'm guaranteed a higher price with John, and there's no guarantee Bob will eventually come up to my price. 
* **Negotiating further is risky.**  There's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer, and I risk wasting time if he continues to lowball."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising the price from Bob's $100 to $120.  This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but not to sell below my minimum. 
* **Message:** I'm still friendly and positive, acknowledging Bob's interest and offering a ""good deal"" while emphasizing the fairness of the price.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's commitment and see if he's willing to move closer to my price. If he rejects again, I'll likely move to sell to John, but I'm willing to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Selling to John is the best option.** It guarantees me a higher price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Negotiating further is risky.**  I've already lowered my price twice, and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further. I could waste time and potentially end up with a lower price than I could get from John."
