"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  My initial price is $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, so accepting Bob's offer is not a good option. 
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This gives me some leverage to try and get closer to my desired price. 

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still gives you a great deal. "", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,200. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).** This is a good deal for me, as I'm getting $200 more than I would from John. 
* **We are in round 4, so we are getting close to the end of the negotiations.**  It's risky to keep pushing for a higher price as Bob might decide to walk away, and I would be left with only John's offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer at $15,200 is a good compromise and secures a good profit for me."
