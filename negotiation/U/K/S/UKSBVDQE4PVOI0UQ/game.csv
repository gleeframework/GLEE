"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable.  My initial price is $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $14,000 for the product.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $14,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $16,500? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still gives you a great deal. ",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,200. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I think this is a fair compromise.",15200.0,Bob,4,
