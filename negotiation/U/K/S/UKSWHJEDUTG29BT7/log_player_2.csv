"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it's worthwhile to try and negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A $3000 discount is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is still within the range Bob is willing to pay and shows a willingness to negotiate seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $15,000 to $13,500, which is a $1500 discount. This is a reasonable price for Bob, considering his maximum budget of $15,000.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal and saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a significantly lower price, especially with the limited number of rounds remaining."
