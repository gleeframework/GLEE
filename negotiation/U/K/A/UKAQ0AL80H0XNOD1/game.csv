"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  To kick things off, I'd like to propose an initial offer of $1,350,000. This takes into account the substantial benefits you'll gain from it.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering your investment and my potential gains.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly, especially considering the potential return on investment for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher number, I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.  How about we settle at $1,180,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,180,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  However, to show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,160,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's make this happen.",1160000.0,Bob,6,
