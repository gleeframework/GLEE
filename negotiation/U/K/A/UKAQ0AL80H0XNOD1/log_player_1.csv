"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this.  While I see the value in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering your investment and my potential gains. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly, especially considering the potential return on investment for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,225,000?"",
""product_price"": 1225000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This price reflects the value we both see in the product, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Bob increasing his offer suggests he's willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher number, I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.  How about we settle at $1,180,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1180000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,180,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  However, to show my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,160,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our respective needs. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,160,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, while our decreases are getting smaller.  At this point, the difference between another counter-offer and Bob's current offer is getting small, and there's a risk he walks away. Accepting the $1,160,000 secures a good profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
