Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal for something that will greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob is worthwhile.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup provides leverage. It allows me to confidently propose a higher price to Bob.

**The message:**

* Highlights value without revealing specific details about Bob's perceived value.
* Positions the price as a special opportunity.
* Avoids being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer."
