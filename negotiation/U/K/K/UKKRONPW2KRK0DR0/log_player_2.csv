"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her product's value to her ($800,000). There's substantial room for negotiation to lower the price. While I could buy from John for $1,500,000, it's worth trying to secure a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my target range. This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's but still leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message maintains a positive tone while clearly stating my position on the price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a better sense of Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the immense value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Room Remains:** Alice has come down $100,000, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, the price is still $700,000 above her value and $200,000 above my alternative option.
* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm willing to keep negotiating as long as Alice is showing a willingness to move on price. There's a chance of reaching a more favorable agreement."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer suggests a common negotiation tactic - finding a middle ground. It demonstrates a willingness to move towards Alice's price while still pursuing a significant discount.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating that $1,200,000 is ""still a bit of a stretch,"" I subtly introduce a sense of urgency, encouraging Alice to consider my offer more seriously. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** The message remains respectful and collaborative, reinforcing the goal of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
