"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $7,000. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
