"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer, could you do $975,000?  That would really help me seal the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
