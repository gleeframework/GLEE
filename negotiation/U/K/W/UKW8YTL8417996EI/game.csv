"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $11,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise.",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,750 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting us closer. I could do $11,800. It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree.",11800.0,Bob,6,
