"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a loss for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $11,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $11,750? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not under any immediate pressure to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,750 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $12,000. This offer represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us closer. I could do $11,800. It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,800 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $14,000, we're running out of rounds.  It's important to remember that I can sell to John for $10,000 at any time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
