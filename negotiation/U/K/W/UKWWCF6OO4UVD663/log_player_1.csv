Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a price slightly below that with Bob allows us to potentially secure a deal faster and avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer entirely.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,150,000  leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for Alice. This price also represents a substantial discount for Bob compared to the product's worth to him ($1,000,000). 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
