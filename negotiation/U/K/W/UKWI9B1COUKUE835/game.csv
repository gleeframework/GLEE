"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the compromise. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $8,500. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $8,500. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
