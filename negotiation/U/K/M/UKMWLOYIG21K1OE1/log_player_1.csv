Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and more than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer."
