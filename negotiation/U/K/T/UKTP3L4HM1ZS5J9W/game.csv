"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my target price.  How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's more in line with what I need.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my desired profit margin.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to make this work, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My absolute limit is $990,000. If you can accept that, we have a deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
