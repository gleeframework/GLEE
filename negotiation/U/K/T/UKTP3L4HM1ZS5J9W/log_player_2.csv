"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a good profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice's offer is still quite high.  It's worth seeing if we can negotiate her down closer to our ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my target price.  How about $1,050,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's more in line with what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While Alice is moving closer to our desired price, we still have room to negotiate. We'll reject this offer and try to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking to maximize your profit. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  Let's try $1,025,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to reach my desired profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Alice is getting closer, but we're also getting close to the point where it might be better to go with John. We'll reject this offer and propose something very close to our limit to see if we can get a good deal before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to make this work, but I need to be realistic about my budget. My absolute limit is $990,000. If you can accept that, we have a deal."",
