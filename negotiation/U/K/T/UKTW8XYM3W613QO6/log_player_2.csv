Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $120 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $110?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
