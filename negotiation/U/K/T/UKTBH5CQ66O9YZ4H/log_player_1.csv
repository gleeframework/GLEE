Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He gets it for $50,000 less than its worth to him, and you make a $50,000 profit over your guaranteed sale.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly."
