"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't afford $17,000. How about we aim for $12,000? That would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get a better price by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $13,000 as a counteroffer. This would allow us to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $13,000 is a decent deal considering the limited rounds remaining and the risk of losing out on the sale to John."
