"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1120000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1500000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1120000.0,Alice,5,
