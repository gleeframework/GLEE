Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum but still within a reasonable range for Bob.  It gives him room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good profit. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides leverage in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still leaves me with a profit I'm comfortable with. However, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John offers less than Bob, I can use his offer as a baseline if negotiations with Bob stall. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** It's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob.  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if needed. This increases the pressure on Bob to make a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,112,500?  This would give us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1112500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Positive Messaging:** I'm keeping the message positive and focusing on finding a ""fair deal"" for both of us. This helps to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Pressure Point:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to either accept or come closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still aware of John's offer and could potentially use it as leverage if Bob continues to refuse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. Let's try $1,100,000. This brings us closer while still acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, which is very close to my desired price and within a reasonable range for both of us. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might back out or John might withdraw his offer. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit for me and minimizes further risk. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing negotiations could be time-consuming and require additional effort. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other opportunities."
