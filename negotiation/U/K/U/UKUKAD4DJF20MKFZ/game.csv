"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me and my own financial limitations.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  To be straightforward, I have a firm offer for $1,200,000 from another buyer. However, I value the rapport we've built during our negotiation. I'm willing to make a final offer of $975,000. This is my absolute bottom line, as it represents a significant compromise on my end.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $925,000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
