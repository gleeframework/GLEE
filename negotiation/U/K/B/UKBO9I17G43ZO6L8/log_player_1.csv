Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to pique Bob's interest.  By offering a price slightly above my minimum, I leave myself room to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a better price.  I believe the product is worth more than $8,500 to me, so I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,500 is a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I've considered your suggestion, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my set limit. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,750? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $8,750 is still above my minimum of $8,000 and is a good compromise.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John for $8,000 is too high."
