"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still above your target of $1,000,000. You have room to negotiate with Alice, and there's a chance you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,200,000, which is still within my budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a substantial reduction and hopefully encourages Alice to counter with a more reasonable price.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, and $1,350,000 is close to my target price. While I'd still prefer to pay less, the risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might reject my counteroffer again, potentially pushing the price higher. At this point, it's a reasonable price, and accepting the offer ensures I get the product within my budget."
