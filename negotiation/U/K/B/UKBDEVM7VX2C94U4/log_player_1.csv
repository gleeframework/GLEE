Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable for you.  I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $14,000."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to earn an extra $1,000 by selling to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $14,000 is a strong incentive for Bob. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price but considerably more than his perceived value.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays associated with finding another buyer (even though John is lined up).

**Important Note:** There's inherent risk in offering a lower price to Bob. If he rejects the offer, I miss out on the extra $1,000. However, the potential reward justifies the calculated risk in this scenario."
