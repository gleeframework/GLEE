Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible (the price John will pay). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves room for potential counter-offers if he's highly motivated.
* **Time Value:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays or complications that might arise from waiting."
