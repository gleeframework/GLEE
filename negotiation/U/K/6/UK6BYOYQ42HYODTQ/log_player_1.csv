{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but not so high that it's immediately rejected. I'm also including a message to encourage Bob to consider the offer and start a conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I need to secure a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to get at least $11,500 for this product. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth every penny. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely.  It also saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
