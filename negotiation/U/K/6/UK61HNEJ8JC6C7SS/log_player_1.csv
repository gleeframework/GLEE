"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My price is $130, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to establish a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for his thoughts, showing that I'm open to discussion. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation at a favorable price while still being open to finding a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to close a deal, accepting such a low offer would result in a substantial loss. Therefore, it's crucial to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $100? I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm counter-offering at $100, which is halfway between my initial offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $60. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing the $100 price as a fair compromise for both of us. 
* **Stay above minimum:**  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to your original offer, Alice.  While $100 is still a bit much for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $70.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer and risk a substantial loss. It's better to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of finding a mutually agreeable price, or to potentially sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $70 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $90?  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm offering $90, which is halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $70. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find a middle ground. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining profit:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $80 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will result in a higher price. Since I have the opportunity to sell to John for $150, which is my minimum price, it's the best decision in this situation. I can guarantee a profit, and it's less risky than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
