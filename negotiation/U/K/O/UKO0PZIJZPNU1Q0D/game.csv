"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this opportunity. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my best compromise, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm confident that this product will be beneficial for my business, but I can't justify exceeding my maximum limit.  My final offer is $850000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, but that's my absolute limit. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the value we both see in this opportunity.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be as close to your budget as possible, but I'm starting to think that we're getting into the territory where the product's value is being underrepresented. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm counteroffering at $920000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",920000.0,Alice,7,
