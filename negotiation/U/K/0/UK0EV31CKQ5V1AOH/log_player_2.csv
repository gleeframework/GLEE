"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is clearly holding firm above $1,070,000, and we have a guaranteed option for $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a very low chance of yielding a better price than we can get from John."
