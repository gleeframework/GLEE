"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored for someone like you who appreciates the value it brings. Don't miss out on this chance to enhance your experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet the value of the product. I would like to offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a special offer considering your interest and the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate, as there's still room to get a better price.  He can potentially get Alice down to his desired price of $10,000 or close to it."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $11,000 is still above my budget. To make this work, I'd need to bring the price down to $10,250. This offer reflects a fair value for both of us, considering the product's quality and my financial limitations. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering your feedback and the value you see in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer for the product is $10,750. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's latest offer of $10,750 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and there's no guarantee Alice will come down to his desired $10,000.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it makes the most sense for Bob to stop negotiating with Alice and buy the product from John. This guarantees him the best price and avoids further time-consuming negotiations."
