"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
