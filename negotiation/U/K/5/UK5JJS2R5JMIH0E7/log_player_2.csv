**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant discount from her claimed value to you, it's still higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You have a strong alternative with John, allowing you to negotiate from a position of strength. By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and potentially secure a better deal."
