{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's offer is above his budget.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**  Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, hoping to get a better price. He's aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. He's also staying within his budget of $10,000."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:** 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price of $10,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can get a lower price. There's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from his previous counteroffer, showing willingness to negotiate. He's also still below his maximum price of $10,000. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, but he can still potentially save money by continuing to negotiate.  He's only $1,000 away from his target price, and it's worth seeing if he can close that gap.  If Alice rejects his next counteroffer, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final counteroffer that's still slightly below his maximum price but shows a willingness to compromise. He's only $500 away from Alice's last offer, hoping to split the difference and reach a deal. This is a reasonable compromise and shows that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now slightly above Bob's target price of $10,000, but it's within his budget and a reasonable compromise after several rounds of negotiation. It's likely that if Bob rejects this offer and makes another counteroffer, Alice might increase the price again. It's also possible that Alice might get tired of negotiating and decide to sell to John instead.  Therefore, it makes sense for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is still within his budget."
