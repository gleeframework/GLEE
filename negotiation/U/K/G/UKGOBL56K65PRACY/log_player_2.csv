"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant markup from his own valuation of the product.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you place on the product and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $1,300,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's original offer, but it's still above what Bob is comfortable paying.  Bob should continue negotiating in hopes of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is a fair price that considers both our positions.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $1,250,000 is still a considerable amount above his valuation.  At this point, the negotiation is getting tense, and there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to compromise.  It's safer for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing a purchase within his budget and avoiding further haggling."
