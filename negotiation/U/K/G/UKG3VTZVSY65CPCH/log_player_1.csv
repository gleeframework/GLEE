Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price Bob might accept maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer positions the product as high-value while still offering Bob a significant gain compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his valuation of the product. 
* Real-world negotiations often involve building rapport and understanding the buyer's needs. This response focuses solely on a single offer scenario."
