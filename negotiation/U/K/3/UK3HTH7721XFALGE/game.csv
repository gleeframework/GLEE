"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers.",12000.0,Alice,3,
