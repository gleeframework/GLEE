"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your belief in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. Would it be possible for us to discuss a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000? I am open to negotiation and would like to explore if we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding my position.  While that price doesn't quite work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to find a solution that benefits us both.  This product is truly exceptional and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm eager to find a way to make this work for you. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my current financial situation, I am still looking for a price closer to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $1,250,000? I hope this suggestion allows us to move forward towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
