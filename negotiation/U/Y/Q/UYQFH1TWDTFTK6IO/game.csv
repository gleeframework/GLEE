"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $135 is a bit steep for me. How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I'm sure this product will be worth every penny for you.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference and go with $127.50.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $127.50 just doesn't work for me.  How about we settle on $129? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm happy to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $128.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my target. ",128.0,Bob,6,
