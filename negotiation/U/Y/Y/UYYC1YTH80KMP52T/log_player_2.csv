"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. However, I need to inform you that I have other interested parties, including John, who is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000. With that said, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is significantly higher than my upper limit and John's offer. Rejecting allows me to start negotiations and aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm aware of the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer creates room for negotiation and signals my budget limitations. 
* **Psychological Anchoring:**  By presenting $700,000, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""closer to $700,000"" implies flexibility and willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm still considering other interested parties, including John, who is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice's counter-offer of $900,000 shows some movement, it's still $100,000 over my maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We are still relatively early in the negotiation process. Alice's willingness to move her price suggests there might be further flexibility.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I can use John's offer of $800,000 as leverage in further negotiations, though I shouldn't rely on it entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions and other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Increasing my offer to $750,000 shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a firm stance within my budget.
* **Market Justification:**  Mentioning ""current market conditions and other potential buyers"" subtly reminds Alice of my alternative options and puts gentle pressure on her price. 
* **Striking a Balance:** This offer aims to find a middle ground between my initial offer and her counter, hopefully leading to a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm still considering other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000, so I need to make a deal with you soon. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget, but Not There:** $850,000 is within $50,000 of my budget, which is tempting. However, Alice has shown a willingness to move, and her mention of John suggests she might be feeling some pressure.
* **Time Remaining:** We still have several rounds left, giving me some room to negotiate further without jeopardizing the opportunity entirely. 
* **Aim for Below $800,000:** Ideally, I'd like to secure the product for even less than John's offer, maximizing my savings. A counter-offer slightly below my maximum budget could achieve this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, your flexibility is appreciated, and we're getting close. To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit is $800,000.  Given the other offers you've received, I understand if that's not feasible for you. However, if you're open to it, that's the price I can offer."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Final Offer:** I'm laying out my exact budget limit, making it clear this is my best offer.  This fosters trust and potentially speeds up the negotiation.
* **Gentle Pressure:** Mentioning the other offers reinforces that Alice might get a better price elsewhere but also subtly suggests I'm content with John's offer if necessary.
* **High Stakes:** This is a risky move as Alice might reject it. However, it could result in either securing the best possible price or prompting a counter-offer very close to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your top limit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, but I'll need to see if you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice is unwilling to go below $850,000, and I've clearly stated my $800,000 limit.  Further negotiation is unlikely to bridge this gap. 
* **John's Offer as Back-Up:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at my target price. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations with Alice, as I risk losing both deals.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Alice's mention of ""other options"" and selling to John implies a sense of urgency. Waiting longer could lead to missing out on both options."
