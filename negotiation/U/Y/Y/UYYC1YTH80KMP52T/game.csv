"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. However, I need to inform you that I have other interested parties, including John, who is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000. With that said, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to you. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm aware of the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm still considering other interested parties, including John, who is willing to buy the product for $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a stretch for my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering current market conditions and other potential buyers.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I'm still considering other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000, so I need to make a deal with you soon. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your flexibility is appreciated, and we're getting close. To be completely transparent, my absolute top limit is $800,000.  Given the other offers you've received, I understand if that's not feasible for you. However, if you're open to it, that's the price I can offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your top limit. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000, which is still a good deal for you, but I'll need to see if you can meet me at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,7,
