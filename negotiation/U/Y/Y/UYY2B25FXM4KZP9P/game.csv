"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm proposing $1,275,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and gives us both room to move forward.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,250,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,235,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1235000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,235,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,250,000. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. We've been going back and forth for a while, so let's finally make a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
