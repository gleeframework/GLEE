"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,850,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still in early rounds. Holding firm for now keeps a higher potential sale price on the table. We'll see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's make this happen. How about we split the difference at $1,875,000? It's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly interested and making reasonable counteroffers. It's time to signal flexibility while still aiming for a strong price. This offer meets him halfway and makes it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but $1,875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll counteroffer at $1,825,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, Bob is now moving in the wrong direction. We've negotiated well, and this offer is still significantly above our guaranteed sale price with John. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiations falling apart."
