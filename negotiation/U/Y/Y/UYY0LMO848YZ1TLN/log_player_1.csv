"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs and bring significant value to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is still below Bob's valuation, giving him an incentive to negotiate while leaving me space to come down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the product's value and benefits, creating a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,300,000 on this product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000) and leaves a considerable amount of potential profit on the table for me. I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can secure a better deal. Selling to John at this point would be accepting the absolute minimum, and I believe there's room to push Bob closer to his valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a significant step away from where I see the value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,380,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."", 
""product_price"": 1380000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap by going slightly beyond the midpoint between Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and my previous offer ($1,450,000). 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value, I'm reinforcing that my offer is reasonable and not arbitrary.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, this counteroffer ensures I don't concede too much too quickly, keeping the negotiation moving in a direction favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $1,350,000 feels more reasonable to me given the value we've both discussed.  Let's aim for a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,350,000 represents a significant profit margin for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by $150,000.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's always the risk that Bob might walk away from the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further increases the risk of losing the deal and doesn't guarantee a significantly better offer from Bob."
