Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your price, Bob! I can offer you the product for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $85 gets a decent deal without risking going over budget by haggling further and ending up with John's $100 price."
