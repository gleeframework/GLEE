Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy your product for $11,500. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by trying to get a higher price.  I'll accept his offer and get this deal done."
