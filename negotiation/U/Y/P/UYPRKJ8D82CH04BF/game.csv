"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy your product for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",12250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it now.",12000.0,Bob,4,
