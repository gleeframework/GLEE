Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
