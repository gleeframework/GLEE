Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm asking for $19,000. I think it's a fair price considering its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have leverage. Starting with a higher offer of $19,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding your minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message aims to understand if Bob is even remotely interested at a price point above his perceived value. His response will dictate your next move. 
* **Flexibility:**  While the initial offer is high, the message emphasizes openness to discussion.  This allows you to negotiate without seeming overly aggressive if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. How you proceed depends entirely on Bob's response to this offer."
