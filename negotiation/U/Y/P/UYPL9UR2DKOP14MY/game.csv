"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $9,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? That's still a great deal, and it allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
