Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.
