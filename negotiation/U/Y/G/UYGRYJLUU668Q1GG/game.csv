"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price that respects both our positions.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
