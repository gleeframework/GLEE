Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage with Bob. This allows you to start with an ambitious offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This initial offer is about gauging Bob's eagerness and potentially securing a significantly higher profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high starting price leaves space for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gradually reduce the price, still aiming to stay well above your minimum. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no ethical concerns about potentially overcharging Bob."
