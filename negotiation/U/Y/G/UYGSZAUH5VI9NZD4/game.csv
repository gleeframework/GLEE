"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  To be fair, I can't go as low as $600,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I can't accept $700,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll be receiving.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
