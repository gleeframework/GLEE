"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle and settle around $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11000.0,Bob,4,
