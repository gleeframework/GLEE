Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
