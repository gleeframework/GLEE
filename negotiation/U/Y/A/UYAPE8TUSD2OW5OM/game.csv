"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
