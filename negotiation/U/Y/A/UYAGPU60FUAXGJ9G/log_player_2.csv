"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $1,150,000 is still above your ideal price point. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** Since Alice's offer is above her minimum, there's still potential to get a better price.  
* **John's price is your fallback.** You have a backup option, so there's no need to rush into an agreement that isn't ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,050,000, which is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price of $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating.
* **Not too low:**  $1,050,000 is still above Alice's minimum price of $1,000,000, making it a reasonable starting point for further negotiation. 
* **Leave room for compromise:** This offer leaves room for both of us to compromise and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,100,000 is still more than you want to pay.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** Alice is willing to come down in price, which means there's still potential for a better deal.
* **John's price is your fallback.**  You can always walk away and buy from John, so there's no pressure to accept an offer you're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Alice halfway:** I'm offering $1,075,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Alice's current offer of $1,100,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Stay within your budget:** $1,075,000 is still within your maximum budget of $1,200,000, but it's closer to your ideal price. 
* **Encourage a deal:** This counteroffer creates a clear opportunity for Alice to accept and for you to secure the product at a better price than her previous offers."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close to your ideal price:**  $1,090,000 is only $20,000 higher than your last counteroffer and is well within your budget.
* **Continuing negotiation is risky:** While you could continue negotiating, it's possible that Alice won't budge further, and you might end up paying John's higher price.
* **Securing the product:** Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product at a reasonable price and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
