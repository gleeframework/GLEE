"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose the specific details at this stage, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let you acquire it for a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for a fair return for me. I'm open to negotiation. Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims the product is worth at least that amount to her, you have no way of verifying this.  It's better to stick with your backup option and buy from John for $1,200,000."
