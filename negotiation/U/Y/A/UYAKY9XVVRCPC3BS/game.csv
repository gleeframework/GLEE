"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $950,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference and aim for $900,000.  I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,5,
