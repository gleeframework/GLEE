Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,250,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum.  Starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Time Pressure:** A 24-hour limit creates urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, so you're not desperate to accept any offer from Bob.

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to adjust your price within reason, keeping your $800,000 minimum in mind.
* **Walk Away:** If Bob is unwilling to meet your price point, you can always sell to John."
