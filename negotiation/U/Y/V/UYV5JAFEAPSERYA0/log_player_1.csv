Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value, and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but it's still a bit lower than my initial price.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, it will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $140 is still below my minimum. I'm going to sell to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than selling for less than I'm willing to accept."
