"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  I'm still a bit above my limit.  How about $9,500?  That's a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,750 is getting close to my target, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I can offer you the product for $10,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal.",10100.0,Alice,7,
