"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
