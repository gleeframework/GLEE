"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but is also looking to get the best possible price.  A $50,000 difference is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us. It's a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is a good price for Bob.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings.  This offer represents a good compromise and secures the product for Bob."
