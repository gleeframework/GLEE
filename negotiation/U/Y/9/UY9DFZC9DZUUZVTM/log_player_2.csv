"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $1,000,000. You know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?  This would still leave a good profit for you and get us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $950,000, which is a good deal.  You are still saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower, and you risk her walking away and you being forced to buy from John at a much higher price."
