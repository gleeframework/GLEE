"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, though. How about $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
