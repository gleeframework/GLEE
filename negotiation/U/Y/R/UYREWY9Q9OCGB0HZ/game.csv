"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $70?  I'm serious about buying if the price is right.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to make the deal right now.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
