Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $120. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product is worth $150 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Aiming High, Staying Reasonable:** Starting with $120 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  This price gives you a significant profit while still offering Bob a good deal compared to his perceived value.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, ensuring you won't be left with no sale."
