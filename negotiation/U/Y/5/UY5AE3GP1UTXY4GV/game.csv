"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $75 and $87.50, which would be $81.25. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",81.25,Alice,5,

"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up slightly. How about $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $78. How about we meet at $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm running out of time and I need to make a decision soon. My last offer is $79.  Take it or leave it.",79.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're running short on time, Bob, but I'm not willing to settle at $79. I'm willing to make one last offer: $83. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be willing to sell it to you at that price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",83.0,Alice,9,
