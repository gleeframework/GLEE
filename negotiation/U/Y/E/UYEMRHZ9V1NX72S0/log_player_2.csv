You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 maximum, and Alice's offer is at that price, there's no reason to negotiate. Buying from John is a guaranteed deal at your maximum price."
