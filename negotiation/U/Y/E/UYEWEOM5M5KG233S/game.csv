"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. How about we compromise at $1,350,000? This still gives you a significant value for the product while allowing me to get closer to my desired price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,300,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
