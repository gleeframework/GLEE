"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a better deal. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with the immediate outcome. I'll try to push for a higher price, utilizing the remaining rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's initial offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to consider a lower offer, but I still have 7 rounds to explore a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is lowering the price, which is concerning, but I'm not willing to settle for $14,000 yet. I still have 6 rounds to try and get a better offer. I'll counter with a price slightly above Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price. This might be a good middle ground to reach an agreement, considering the remaining rounds and the alternative of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer has gone below my minimum value.  Given that we only have 4 rounds left, I'm better off selling to John for $15,000 to ensure I meet my minimum target."
