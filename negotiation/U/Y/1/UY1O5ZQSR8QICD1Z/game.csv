"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save some money. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $14,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,4,
