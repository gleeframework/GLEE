"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. I value it highly, but believe it could be transformative for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I understand budget considerations.  To move this forward, I propose $1,350,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my end while acknowledging the product's potential benefits for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  You clearly see the value of this product and what it can do for you.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
