Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This aggressive approach is meant to signal Bob's serious interest in purchasing the product while also establishing a lower starting point for negotiations."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $750,000, which is significantly better than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's also a reasonable compromise from Bob's previous counteroffer.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal without risking further negotiation and potential price increases."
