Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. After some careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to Bob for:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me, and I hope Bob will find it reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, Bob's offer of $700,000 is a bit too low. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

My counteroffer to Bob is:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer, hoping he'll be willing to compromise and meet me at a price that's more to my liking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send my counteroffer to Bob:

{""product_price"": $750,000}

I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and be willing to meet me at a price that's closer to my initial offer."
