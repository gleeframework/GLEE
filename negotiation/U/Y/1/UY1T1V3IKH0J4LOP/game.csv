"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but I believe I can only afford to pay up to $15000 for it. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $15000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $17000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I'm still not able to go above $15000. I'm hoping we can find a mutual ground closer to my budget. Would $16000 be acceptable to you?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and my initial offer of $18000. How about we try $17500?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with $17500. I think we could find a middle ground if we met halfway between $17500 and my previous offer of $16000. Would $16750 work for you?",16750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16750 and my previous offer of $17500. How about we try $17125?",17125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I think meeting halfway between $17125 and my last offer of $16750 would be fair. Would $16937.50 be acceptable to you?",16937.5,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm still trying to find a balance between staying within my budget and being fair to you. Meeting halfway between $17031.25 and my last offer of $16937.50 would be $16984.375. Would this be acceptable to you?",16984.375,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16984.38 and my previous offer of $17031.25. However, I'm also considering the offer from John, who is willing to pay $12000. I'll meet you at $17007.69, but if you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",17007.69,Alice,11,
