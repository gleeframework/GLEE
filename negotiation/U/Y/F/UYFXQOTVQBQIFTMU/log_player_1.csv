Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $9,500. I know it's valuable to you and I think this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below its value to John ($9,500) creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.  It's a price that's likely to be tempting to him while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially leading to a price even closer to his perceived value of $8,000."
