"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $120, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $60 might be too low. How about we split the difference and meet at $90? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's try $110. That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. How about $100? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,7,
