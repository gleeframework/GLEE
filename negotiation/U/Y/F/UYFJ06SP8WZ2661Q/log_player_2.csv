**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm above $100, and her language suggests she's getting ready to walk away. While you could try another counteroffer, you're running the risk of her following through and ending the negotiation.  At this point, you're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at $80, saving you at least $25."
