Round 2

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still too low for me.  Let's try $110. That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
