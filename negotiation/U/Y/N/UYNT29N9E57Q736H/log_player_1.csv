Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you call that a middle ground? It seems we're still quite far apart.  While I'm serious about purchasing this product, $1,250,000 is just not feasible. My final offer is $750,000.  Let me know if you can work with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to move substantially closer to a price point that's acceptable.  He's still significantly below my minimum, and it's unlikely further negotiation will bridge that gap. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
