"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice, and you are willing to pay up to $15,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. You are still willing to pay more than Alice's current offer, but you should see if you can negotiate her price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $13,000, but I'm still only able to offer $11,000 at this time.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we aim for $12500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a more accurate reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is now offering it for $12,500.  This is a good deal for you, as you're saving $2,500.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, and you'd be risking losing the deal to John if you reject it."
