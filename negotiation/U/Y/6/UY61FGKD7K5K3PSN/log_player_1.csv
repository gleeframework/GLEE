Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, while still securing a profit above our minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency with ""limited time"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed $150 from John."
