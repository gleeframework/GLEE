{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth starting a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate the product, $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still a bit high, but it's getting closer. It's worth seeing if we can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $130 is still a bit too much for me. I'm happy to pay $115.  Let's split the difference and make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $125. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to secure the product from John for the price I'm comfortable with rather than risk continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the product altogether."
