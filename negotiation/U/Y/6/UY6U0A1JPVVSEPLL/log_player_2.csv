(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, aiming to signal that I'm serious about buying the product but at a price that's within my budget. This counteroffer provides space for negotiation while still leaving room for me to make further concessions if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, her offer is still too high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price.  It's still early in the negotiation, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below Alice's latest offer. This signals that I'm willing to meet halfway, while also showing that I'm serious about closing the deal.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will encourage Alice to be more flexible in her next offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my target price, but it's getting closer. There's still some room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to agree to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final push for a price closer to my target.  My offer is only $50,000 lower than Alice's, showing I'm serious about making a deal.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be ready to buy from John."
