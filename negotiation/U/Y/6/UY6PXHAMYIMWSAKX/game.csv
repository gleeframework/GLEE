"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's fair to me.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you consider $8250? It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to come to an agreeable solution.",8250.0,Alice,5,
