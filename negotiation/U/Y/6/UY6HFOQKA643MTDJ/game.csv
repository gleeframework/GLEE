"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This still gives you a significant opportunity for growth, and it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,400,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This would allow me to make this sale and you would still get a great deal. Let's close this deal!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
