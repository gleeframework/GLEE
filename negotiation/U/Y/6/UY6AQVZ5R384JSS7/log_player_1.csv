Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth millions in the right hands. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,850,000. I'm confident this price reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I'm in a strong position to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Value Emphasis:** My message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, aiming to justify a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is ambitious. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium.  If he rejects this offer, I can always come down in price, knowing I have John as a safety net."
