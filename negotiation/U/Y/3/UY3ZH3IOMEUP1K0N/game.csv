"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I recognize its potential value, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to offer $800000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it can bring to your business or personal life. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $875000 is getting closer to where I need to be, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go to $850000 for the product.  This shows my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal!",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000, but that's as low as I can go. This price still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair deal.
