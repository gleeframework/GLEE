"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($100) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product without explicitly stating it.

This initial offer is a starting point for negotiation. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate, and I can potentially get a higher price than Bob's offer. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is tempting, I still have time to potentially improve on his price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, but still above his offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a compromise by reducing my price but still staying above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reiterate Value:** My message reiterates that this is a good deal for Bob, even at the slightly higher price. 
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially leading Bob to accept.

This counteroffer is a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. I would like to propose $90 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** With 6 rounds remaining, I believe there's still room for negotiation and the possibility of getting closer to my desired price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I'm hesitant to sell to John yet because I'm close to a deal with Bob, and I'm hopeful that I can get a higher price.

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to make a small profit on this. How about we split the difference and go with $92? This is truly my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer represents a compromise and shows my willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Finality:** The phrase ""final offer"" adds pressure and encourages Bob to consider accepting.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While $92 is still below my ideal price, it's a substantial profit and closer to my minimum acceptable offer.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will convince Bob to accept, but if not, I'll need to start considering selling to John as the rounds are getting shorter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found that the product is available elsewhere for $80. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to start prioritizing a sale.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and with the rounds dwindling, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob is too high.

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my ideal price, the pressure of the time limit and the likelihood of Bob not increasing his offer make selling to John the more secure option at this point."
