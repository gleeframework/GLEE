"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm going to start high, aiming for a good portion of Bob's perceived value. I'll be ready to negotiate down if needed, but want to see where he stands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a good amount, it's still significantly lower than my starting offer. I want to try to get closer to $1,400,000 before considering selling to John. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for this price yet. I'm going to continue to counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to come up more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a little more.  I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for him to consider, but if he rejects it, I'll have to weigh my options carefully."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is approaching my minimum, it's still below what I consider a fair price, and I believe Bob can afford to offer a little more.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm starting to get close to the point where selling to John might be the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

This is my final attempt to get closer to my desired price. I'm meeting Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to go lower.  If he rejects this, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is only $50,000 more than what John is offering. There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round. To avoid risking losing out on any profit, it's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
