"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. It's a truly unique opportunity to own something of immense value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to offer $750000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiations. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still leaving you with a good return. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
