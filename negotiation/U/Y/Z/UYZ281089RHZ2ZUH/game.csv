"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget. While I am interested in this product, I can only offer $850000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I see in the product for my needs.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $900000?  This would give you a good return while allowing me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920000. It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $920000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $910000.  This is a fair compromise that will allow us both to get a good deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $915000. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get the deal done. What do you think?",915000.0,Alice,7,
