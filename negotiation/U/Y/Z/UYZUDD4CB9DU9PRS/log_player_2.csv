"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm sure you'd love it! I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, and if that fails, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's asking price. Starting with a low counteroffer gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially securing a great deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is respectful and acknowledges Alice's offer, which can help keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is closer to our ideal price range and leaves a gap for further negotiation.  If Alice rejects it outright, we can still increase our offer without exceeding our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $77.50?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $77.50 is a significant discount from Alice's original asking price and a decent saving compared to John's $80 offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk that Alice walks away.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk missing out entirely."
