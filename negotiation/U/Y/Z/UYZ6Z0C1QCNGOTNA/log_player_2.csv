"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can save money by rejecting it. You know John will sell it for $100, and you're willing to pay that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open up the possibility of her lowering the price further, or you can simply proceed with John."
