Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, implying that you'll list it publicly suggests it's desirable and might attract other buyers, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, increasing the likelihood of a sale above your minimum price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and leaving space for a mutually agreeable deal."
