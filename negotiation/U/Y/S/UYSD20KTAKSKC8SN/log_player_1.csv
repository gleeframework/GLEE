"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $180. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$180:** This is a starting point above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It leaves room for negotiation but still sets a high initial value. 
* **Message:**  A friendly and positive opening message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $160 is better than John's offer of $120, there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price by sending a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $160 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $170. This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$170:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for Bob, and reminding him of my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $170, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $165 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $165 is only $5 below my previous counteroffer of $170.  It's a good deal considering my minimum is $120, and it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult to get much closer to my desired price.  Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
