""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be very valuable for you. I'm willing to sell it for $11,500.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving her with the highest profit margin before resorting to selling to John for $12,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 makes it appealing to Bob (who values it at $10,000) while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down."
