"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet at least $10,500 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",10500.0,Alice,5,
