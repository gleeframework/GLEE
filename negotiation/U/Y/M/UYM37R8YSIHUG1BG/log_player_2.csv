{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm aiming for a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,500 is closer to my preferred price, but I still believe I can do better.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,750 is very close to my last counteroffer of $11,000.

* It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing a good deal by continuing to counteroffer."
