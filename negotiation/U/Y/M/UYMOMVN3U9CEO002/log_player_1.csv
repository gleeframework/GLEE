Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving some room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is better than Bob's initial value of $120, it is still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. I'm still a bit hesitant at $135.  How about $132? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $132 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150. It's clear that further negotiation is unlikely to get me to my target, and I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum price. So, I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John and avoid further negotiation."
