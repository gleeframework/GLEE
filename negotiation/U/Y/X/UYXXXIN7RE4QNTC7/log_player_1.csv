Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to make a deal at $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 with John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to my minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested parties"", I create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
