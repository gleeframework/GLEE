Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe a price of $14,000 is fair considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $15,000 to John, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit than $8,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $14,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This price is significantly above Bob's perceived value but below my guaranteed sale price.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays involved in waiting for John to complete the purchase. 

This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for earning a higher profit than selling to John."
