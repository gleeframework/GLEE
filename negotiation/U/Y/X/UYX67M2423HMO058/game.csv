"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to buy it from you for $7000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price that makes this a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
