"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'd be happy to buy it from you for $7,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point of $7,000.  You can likely still negotiate a lower price with Alice, so rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8000?  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price that makes this a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
