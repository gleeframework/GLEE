Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it would be valuable to you, so I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could increase your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, but still ensures you a significant gain over his perceived value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Starting closer to your minimum acceptable price ($12,000) increases the chances of Bob outright accepting, as it might appear like a ""take it or leave it"" offer.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price and the certainty of selling to John at your minimum."
