"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $8,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,250. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $8,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",8750.0,Alice,5,
