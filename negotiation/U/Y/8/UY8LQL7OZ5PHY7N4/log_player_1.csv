Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
``` 

This offer is calculated based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **My Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to me.
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000.

By offering $1,400,000, I am:

* **Maximizing my profit:** I get $400,000 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob still has a potential gain of $100,000 if he accepts. 

This strategy aims to maximize my earnings while increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
