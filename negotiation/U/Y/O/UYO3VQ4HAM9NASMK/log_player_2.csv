"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a price that reflects its true worth. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high, considering my maximum budget is $1,000,000 and the product's value to Alice is $800,000. It's worth negotiating further to potentially secure a better price.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to me and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable, given the value you'll be getting from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my desired price point. I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as a fair and mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm willing to make a slight concession to $920,000, but I think that's as far as I can go. This price still reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she's shown a willingness to negotiate, she's not coming down to a price I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $875,000. I believe there's still room for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're getting closer, but $920,000 is still a bit too high.  Let's split the difference and settle on $890,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to stay within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $920,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $915,000 is getting close to my desired price point.  I've only got three rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. While I would prefer to pay less, accepting this offer ensures I secure the product and avoid a potentially higher cost."
