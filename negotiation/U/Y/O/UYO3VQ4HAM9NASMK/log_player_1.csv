I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to offer $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant compromise from my initial offer. I hope you'll consider this as a fair and mutually beneficial price.
