"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to stay close to $8000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial target. Would you be willing to come down to $8250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a great addition to my needs.",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get as close to your target as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8400. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $8375. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8375.0,Alice,5,
