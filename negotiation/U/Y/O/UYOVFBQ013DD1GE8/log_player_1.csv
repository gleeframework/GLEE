Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that he'll immediately reject the offer. I'm confident in the value of the product and hope to maximize my profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my initial asking price and also below the guaranteed value I can get from John. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's below my baseline. I'll counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profitable deal. It's also a reasonable middle ground between my asking price and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has moved closer to my asking price, I'm not willing to continue negotiating.  At this point, the potential for further gains is minimal, and the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer is high. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. This is the most prudent choice to ensure a quick and secure sale."
