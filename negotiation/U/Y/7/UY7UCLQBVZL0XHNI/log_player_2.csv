**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Here's the breakdown:

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Bob's value:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy from John for $1,000,000, which is still within Bob's budget and saves him $50,000 compared to Alice's offer."
