Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Potential for higher profit:** I'm aiming for a profit of $300,000, but I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject my offer, but the potential reward of a higher price outweighs that risk. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** If Bob values the product higher than $1,500,000, I could potentially earn more.
* **Guarantee a profit:** Even if Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John and secure a profit of $300,000.

This is a strategic offer that balances potential gain with a safety net."
