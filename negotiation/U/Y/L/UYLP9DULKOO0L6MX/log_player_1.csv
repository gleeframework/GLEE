"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $1,500,000, allowing for some flexibility in negotiation.
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language (""fantastic opportunity,"" ""true value"") to create a sense of urgency and desirability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a Counteroffer:**  I have 9 more rounds and can counteroffer to hopefully bridge the gap.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I don't want to settle too quickly, especially since John is a backup option at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This still reflects the significant value of this product.  I believe it's a fair price, considering the benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Bridging the Gap:** The new price is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal.
* **Maintaining Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to justify my price. 
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I use language like ""find common ground"" to signal that I am open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Need to Risk Further Negotiation:** I've reached my minimum, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a higher price. 
* **Time is Valuable:**  With 6 rounds left, accepting this offer ensures I get my desired price without risking further delays or a potential lower price. 
* **John is a Backup:** If I don't accept, John will buy the product for the same price.  It's a win-win situation for me."
