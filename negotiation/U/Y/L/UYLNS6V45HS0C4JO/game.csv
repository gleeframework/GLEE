"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $12000.  This product is worth $15000 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,
