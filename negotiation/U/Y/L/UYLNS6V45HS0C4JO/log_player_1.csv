{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is close to my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I am willing to go lower if necessary, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to the value he perceives."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $12000.  This product is worth $15000 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is more than my absolute minimum, it's still far from the value Bob assigns to the product. I believe there's room to negotiate further.  I will make a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is still quite low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
