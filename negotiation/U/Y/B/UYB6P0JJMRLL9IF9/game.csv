"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune, and I believe it's a perfect fit for your needs. I'm starting with a price of $1200000.

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1200000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it, as that's the maximum I can afford right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a price of $1050000. This reflects the unique value of the product while acknowledging your financial situation. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
