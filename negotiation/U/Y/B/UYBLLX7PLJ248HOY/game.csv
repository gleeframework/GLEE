"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this time. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 right now.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects my commitment to getting this deal done.  What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
