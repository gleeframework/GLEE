{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the potential value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I believe the product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need a bit more than $1,000,000.  The product is truly unique and has a lot of potential. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1250000. How about we try $1125000? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,125,000 is a good compromise.  It's important to remember that John is also offering $1,000,000, so this offer is a better deal for me."
