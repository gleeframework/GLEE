"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than what John is offering, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good deal:**  At $11,500, Bob can save $3,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation may not yield much more savings:** Alice has already moved down from her initial price, and further negotiation might be time-consuming and might not result in a significant price difference.
* **Opportunity cost:** Spending more time negotiating could mean missing out on other opportunities or potentially losing the product altogether. 

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option considering the time and potential risk involved."
