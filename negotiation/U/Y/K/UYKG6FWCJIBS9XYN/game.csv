"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice.  How about $95?  That's a fair price.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $100. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,5,
