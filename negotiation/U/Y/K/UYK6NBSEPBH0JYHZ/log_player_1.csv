Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum desired price.  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, this is a high offer, but it allows room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping the option open to sell to John for my minimum desired price if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still a good starting point for further negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
