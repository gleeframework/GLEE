"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is fair considering its worth to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product is useful to me, but not to that degree. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my limit. If we can't agree on a price within this range, I'll have to consider my other options.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
