# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's starting offer is way too high.  I need to negotiate a much lower price or consider John's offer."

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product is useful to me, but not to that degree. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",

I'm starting with a very low offer to see how Alice reacts. It's a risky move, but it establishes my position and leaves plenty of room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

While $900,000 is closer to a reasonable range, it's still too high. I need to show Alice I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't come down further. John's offer is looking more tempting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my limit. If we can't agree on a price within this range, I'll have to consider my other options."", 
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer but setting a firm boundary. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost.  This also gives us room to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price, hopefully closer to $700,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not getting the price I want. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unwilling to budge from a price that significantly exceeds my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worthwhile. John's offer of $800,000 is the more sensible option at this point."
