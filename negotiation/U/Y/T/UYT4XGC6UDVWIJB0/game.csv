"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the starting price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities and future prospects.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that this product has significant value, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I could consider a price closer to  $1,250,000. This offer reflects a willingness to meet you closer to the middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant gap from my desired outcome.  I'm willing to accept $1,600,000.  This offer reflects a final compromise to hopefully close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  My final offer is $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair considering the market value and allows me to make a reasonable investment.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
