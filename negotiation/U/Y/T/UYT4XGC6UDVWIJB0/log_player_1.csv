Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,600,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  My final offer is $1,350,000. I believe this price is fair considering the market value and allows me to make a reasonable investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that $1,350,000 is his final offer. This is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better offer from Bob.  Therefore, the best course of action is to cut my losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
