"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your product is good, $1,050,000 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000. This is still a great offer for you, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
