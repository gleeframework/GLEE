"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By beginning with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), we establish a strong anchoring point and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer of $1,400,000 allows for potential concessions throughout the 10 rounds while ensuring a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception and encourage a favorable response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,500,000).  This indicates he has room to move considerably.  I'll reject this offer to signal that it's unacceptable and encourage him to negotiate upwards. I'm confident I can get a better deal within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a fair deal.  However,  $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory but Firm:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and desire for a fair deal while clearly stating it's too low. 
* **Significant Step Down but Above Minimum:** The $1,350,000 counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but stays comfortably above my $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the compromise encourages Bob to perceive the new offer as fair and potentially acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement and now sits above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob could walk away or that the negotiations could stagnate. Accepting this offer guarantees a solid profit and a quick close to the deal."
