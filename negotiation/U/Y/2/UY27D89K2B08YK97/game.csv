"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a fair deal.  However,  $1,100,000 undervalues the product significantly. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,350,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
