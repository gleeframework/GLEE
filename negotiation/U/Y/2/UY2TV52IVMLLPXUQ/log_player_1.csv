"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it could bring to my business. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is significantly below the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be at least at $850,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $850,000 is a bit too high for my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is equal to what John is willing to pay. While I'd prefer to earn more, it's not worth risking the deal with Bob and potentially losing out on any profit."
