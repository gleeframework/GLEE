"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1290000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what John is offering.  You're getting very close to your target price, but there's no guarantee Alice will continue to lower her price, and the negotiations could drag on. 

It's now more advantageous to buy from John for a guaranteed price of $1,200,000. This ensures you get the product at your target price and saves you further negotiation time."
