"Hi Alice, thanks for your opening offer.  That price seems a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  I believe this offer is a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value is important to you.  To be honest,  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could meet you halfway at $1,075,000.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  While $1,075,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from my bottom line.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This allows me to make a fair profit while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is getting closer, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Could we make a deal at $1,150,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
