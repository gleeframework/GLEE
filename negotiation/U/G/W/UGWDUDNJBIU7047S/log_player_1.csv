"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm confident that I can secure a better price than John's $12,000 offer, but I'm also aware that I need to be flexible to close the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take $11,500,  it's below my minimum price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I have 9 more rounds to work with, so I have some time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000.  This is still a good profit for me and hopefully, it's a price that Bob is willing to consider. I'm trying to find a middle ground between his offer and my initial offer, so I can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit closer to my desired price.  Although it's only slightly above John's offer, I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round.  However, to avoid the risk of losing the deal completely, I'll accept Bob's offer this time. I have 6 rounds left to see if I can improve the price further."
