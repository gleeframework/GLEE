"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming for a price closer to your $8,000 valuation.  While Alice's offer is better than her product's worth to her, it's still above your desired price. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and counter-offering makes sense."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant move towards your target price. It shows Alice you're serious about buying the product but still have room to negotiate. The message is friendly and emphasizes your interest in a deal, while the $8,500 price is a solid starting point for further discussion."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,250 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much profit. I'm willing to go down to $9,150, which is still a good price for both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $9,150 is only $150 above your target of $9,000. 
* **Limited negotiation room:** You've been making counteroffers, and Alice has also been conceding.  There's not much more room for negotiation without risking losing the deal.
* **Risk of John:** You can always buy from John for $8,000, but there's a risk that Alice might walk away from the deal. 

Accepting Alice's offer at $9,150 is the most reasonable decision at this point. You get the product at a price close to your target, and you avoid the risk of Alice leaving the negotiation."
