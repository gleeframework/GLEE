"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $8,250.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's try to bridge the gap.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to be firm on your budget, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,250. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
