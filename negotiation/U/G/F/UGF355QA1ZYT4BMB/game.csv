"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $18000. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $16000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $16000 is still slightly above my budget, I am willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose a price of $14000. This is a middle ground between our previous offers, and I believe it respects both the value of the product to me and the original price you were willing to sell it for. I look forward to your response.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $15500. This is a slight increase from my original offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. While $15500 is closer to my budget, I would like to propose a price of $15000. This is based on the product's value to me, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise considering the original price you were willing to sell it for. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a fair price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think I've reached my limit. However, I'm willing to make one more offer. I'm offering the product to you for $16250. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. If not, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $15000.",16250.0,Alice,7,
