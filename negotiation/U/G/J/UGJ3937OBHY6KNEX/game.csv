"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. $9,200 is still a bit low for me. To be completely honest, I'm really starting to consider selling the product to John for $8,000. I think I'd rather take a slightly lower price than risk losing out completely.  Let's try to find some middle ground. How about $9,350? It's not a huge jump from your last offer, but it would make this deal worthwhile for me.",9350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $9,350. Would you consider $9,275?",9275.0,Bob,6,
