"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. While I'm interested in the product, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now. I'm willing to offer $12,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate further, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to wait for a better offer from you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $13,000 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about $12,750? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both walk away happy with this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'm willing to throw in some additional services that complement the product, which will increase the total value to you. However, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product itself. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's my final offer on the product price.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the extra value you're offering with the services. However,  I'm still trying to stay within a specific budget.  I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product, which is closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to throw in one more sweetener to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty on the product, which will give you added peace of mind and protection. However, I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as high as I can go.",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the warranty offer, but it's not quite enough to sway me at this price. I'm sticking with my last offer of $13,000 for the product. We're both close, and this feels like a fair compromise. Let's close the deal.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're determined to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $13,100, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not making any further concessions on the price. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to throw in the 5-year warranty as a gesture of goodwill.",13100.0,Alice,9,
