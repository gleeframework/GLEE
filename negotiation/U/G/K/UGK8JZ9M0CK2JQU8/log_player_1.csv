{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you make a profit and don't settle for less than your desired value.
* **It shows good faith:** By starting with a somewhat reasonable price, you demonstrate that you're willing to work with Bob to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 

Remember, the goal is to get the best price possible, but also to keep the negotiation open to avoid having to sell to John and miss out on a possible higher offer from Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  It's also closer to Bob's perceived value than my initial offer.  I'm going to try to get closer to my minimum by making a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:

I'm getting close to my minimum, but Bob isn't willing to budge much more.  I don't want to keep going back and forth and risk losing him completely.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John for $15,000."
