"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could you do $10,000? That would seal the deal for me.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer in this range.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $10,500 is close, but I need to stay closer to $10,000. How about we split the difference and do $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer. I can do $10,500, but I need to make a bit more than that to meet my minimum. How about we do $10,750? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",10750.0,Alice,7,
