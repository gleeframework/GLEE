"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 13000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible. I know Bob values the product at $8,000, so I'm offering a price that's a significant jump from that, but still potentially attractive to him. I'll see if he bites, and if not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price. I believe I can push for a better deal, especially since I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. I'm not yet ready to settle for less than my minimum goal, and I'm confident I can get closer to it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is still a considerable profit for me and a more reasonable price for Bob, considering his initial offer of $11,000. It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a solid price point. I'm hoping this will be more enticing for Bob, while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to get nervous about the dwindling rounds,  $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm hoping to close the deal with Bob, but I'm not willing to sell at such a significant discount. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $11,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. It's also closer to his last offer of $10,500. With only 5 rounds left, I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While time is running out, I'm not willing to sell for $10,000. It's still significantly lower than my desired price, and I believe I can get closer to my target with just a few rounds left. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least get closer to my desired price before I have to resort to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. With only 3 rounds left, I'm taking a more aggressive approach.  This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal. It's also a compromise, as it's closer to his offer of $10,000.  I'm hoping this will be enough to sway him. If not, I might have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a better offer from Bob is too high. Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge much further in the next round.  To ensure I don't end up with a significantly lower profit, I'm going to sell to John. Although I would have preferred to sell to Bob, I'm securing my minimum profit by selling to John."
