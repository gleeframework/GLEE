{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $100, but leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that he's getting a good deal.  I'm also being friendly and engaging to build rapport.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately. Bob's offer is too low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $100 would be a fair price for me considering my budget. Would you be able to meet me halfway at $106.25? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price. I'm comfortable accepting $106.25. It's higher than what John would pay, and we've already established a rapport with Bob, making a future relationship with him possible."
