,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my offer of $10,750.  I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. ",10750.0,Bob,6,
