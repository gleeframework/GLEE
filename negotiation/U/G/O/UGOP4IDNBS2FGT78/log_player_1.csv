Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate slightly downwards. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  We have a strong fallback option with John at $10,000, so we don't need to be desperate.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing the sale."
