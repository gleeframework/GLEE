"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that we believe will bring significant value to your business. We're starting with a price of $1100000, which we believe is a fair and competitive offer considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you've outlined. However, I'm aiming to acquire this product for a bit less. Let's start with a price of $950000.  This is still a good value for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1050000. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us. You'd still be making a profit, and it would be a great deal for me. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's stick with my previous offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
