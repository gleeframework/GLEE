Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I'm asking $11,000 for the product. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $8800, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $8600, which is the lowest I can go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm starting to run out of time. I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will only lead to lower offers.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. It's a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum price requirement."
