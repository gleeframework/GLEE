"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum of $120, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $140 is less than Bob's maximum of $150, making it a potentially attractive offer for him.
* **It's a clear message:** The message is friendly and straightforward, setting the stage for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is your minimum, you've already established a higher value with Bob in the previous round.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to go a bit lower to make this work. How about $130? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still thinking $120 is a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $125, which is only $5 less than your previous counteroffer of $130. You've already established a value higher than $120, and it's risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting the offer ensures you get a better price than selling to John, and you're only 5 dollars away from your ideal price."
