Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While we start high, the message implies some flexibility, potentially leading to a price Bob is happy with, above our minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive counter-offers.

**Important:**  We don't want to go too low initially. If Bob rejects this offer, we still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000."
