"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, considering the market value of the product is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still more than Alice's minimum value ($12,000).  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a little less. How about $13,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a little less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. Accepting this offer would be the most financially advantageous decision for Bob."
