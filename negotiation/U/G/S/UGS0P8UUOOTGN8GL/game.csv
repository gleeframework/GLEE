"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1800000 is a bit too low for me at this stage.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. Given my financial considerations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1750000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're able to offer while still being within my budget.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the counteroffer.  However, $1750000 still falls short of where I need to be. I'm willing to go down to $1850000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate further. I appreciate your efforts in lowering the price. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1800000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Bob,6,
