"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's talk."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob to make him more motivated to negotiate.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to discuss, implying flexibility in the price.

This strategy aims to secure a higher price while leaving room for negotiation, ensuring a potential deal without losing out to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left, which gives me ample time to negotiate a better price.
* **Sell to John is not an option yet:** Although I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and hopefully reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still allows me to meet my needs while giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm not accepting his low offer but demonstrating a willingness to compromise by dropping my price.
* **Focus on Middle Ground:** I suggest finding a ""middle ground"" to make the negotiation feel collaborative.
* **Clear Justification:**  I justify my counteroffer by stating it still allows me to meet my needs while offering a good deal to Bob. 

This approach aims to:

* Show Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement, while also maintaining a price that's closer to my desired value.
* Increase the chances of Bob accepting a price that's more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $950,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and I have 6 rounds left. I can potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I'm still hoping to maximize my profit with Bob.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating. By doing so, I maintain the possibility of securing a higher price from Bob without jeopardizing my minimum goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer.  This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Position:**  I show I'm listening to Bob's concerns about price and acknowledge his desire for a good deal.
* **Emphasizing Costs:** I subtly remind Bob that I have costs to cover, making my price seem more justifiable.
* **Gradual Compromise:** I'm gradually lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility and building trust.
* **Focusing on Value:** I reiterate the value the product brings to Bob, subtly reinforcing the justification for my price.

This counteroffer:

* Shows I'm serious about negotiating.
* Allows for potential further compromise, but not at the expense of my minimum price.
* Keeps the deal alive while pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting close to my limit, but I can offer you $1,025,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $475,000 below my desired $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still ongoing:** We have 4 rounds left. I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the best choice. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can potentially squeeze out a better price from Bob.  

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating.  There's still time to potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Bob without taking the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
