"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.
* You are willing to pay up to $10,000, so you can afford to counteroffer and see if you can get a better price. 
* Rejecting the first offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's $500 lower than Alice's initial price. 
* This shows I'm serious about negotiating but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
*  I'm still within my budget and  leaving some room for Alice to accept, making the counteroffer reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved slightly from her initial offer, but we're still in the negotiation phase. 
* There's still room for Alice to lower the price further. 
* Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to secure a lower price. 
*  This keeps me in control of the negotiation and potentially saves me more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows Alice that I'm serious about buying. 
* I'm still below Alice's current offer, which gives her incentive to accept.
*  It allows me to potentially close the deal at a price closer to my target."
