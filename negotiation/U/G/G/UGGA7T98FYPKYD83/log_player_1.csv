"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the full value he sees in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $9,500. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,250. This is a small step down from my initial offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept, but it's still a good price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $100 less than my last counteroffer.  At this point,  I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price.  It's close to my desired range, and it's worth taking the deal to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for less."
