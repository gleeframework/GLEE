Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $850,000 undervalues the true potential and benefits of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about we agree on $900,000? This reflects the value it can bring to your business."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. How about we try $875,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While I could push for more, accepting $875,000 is a significant gain over my minimum acceptable price and a good deal overall. It's better to secure a good offer now than risk the negotiation going south and having to settle for John's offer."
