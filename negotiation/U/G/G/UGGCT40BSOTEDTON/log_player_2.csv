"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** Buying from Alice for $950,000 saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's still within your budget:**  The $950,000 price is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
