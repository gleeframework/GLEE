"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be perfect for you. I'm thinking of a price around $20,000 to start. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we settle at $14,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, Alice, but $14,500 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,250. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,6,
