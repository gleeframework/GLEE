"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair and competitive price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $800,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it for less. He should counteroffer to see if he can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to lower the price to $750,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $750,000 is a good price and closer to his desired range, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He should counteroffer again, aiming for something closer to $700,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to lower the price to $735,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $735,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, he's already negotiated significantly from the initial price of $800,000.  $735,000 is a good compromise, and  attempting to further lower the price risks losing the deal altogether.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 would be a much worse outcome."
