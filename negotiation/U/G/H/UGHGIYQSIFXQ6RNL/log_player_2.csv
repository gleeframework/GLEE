"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have a maximum budget of $12,000 and John is offering it for that price, there's no immediate need to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11500 to make this deal worthwhile for me. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above your ideal price point, but closer than her initial offer. Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make at least $12000 to feel comfortable. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at your maximum budget of $12,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll budge further, and you're already at risk of running out of rounds. Buying from John at the same price guarantees you get the product without the risk of the negotiation failing."
