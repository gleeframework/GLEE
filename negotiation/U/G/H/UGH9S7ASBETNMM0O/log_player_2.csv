Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $500,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $650,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's likely to stick close to her $700,000 offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential savings.  This price represents a significant discount from both Alice's value and John's price."
