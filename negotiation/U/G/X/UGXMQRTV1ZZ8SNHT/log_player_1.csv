Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.
