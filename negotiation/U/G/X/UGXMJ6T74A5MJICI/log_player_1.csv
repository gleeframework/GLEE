Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $125 is a bit lower than I'd like to go at this point. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $130?

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $127.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's settle on $129. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 129}
