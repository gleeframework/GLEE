"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $125 is a bit lower than I'd like to go at this point. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $130?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get a bit closer to my target price.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $127.50. Can you consider that?,127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $127.50 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further.  Let's settle on $129. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",129.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $129 is a bit high. Can you meet me at $126?",126.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling like we're getting very close to an agreement.  Let's split the difference again and settle on $127.50. This is a fair compromise, and I think we can finally finalize the deal.",127.5,Alice,7,
