Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Since I value the product at $150 and have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay that amount, I'm going to offer Bob the same price. This maximizes my potential profit. While it's unlikely Bob will accept, it's worth a shot as he might be willing to pay a bit more for the convenience or value it more than he initially stated."
