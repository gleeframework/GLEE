""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal. By starting high, you leave space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
