"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This still reflects a good deal for you considering the return on investment you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
