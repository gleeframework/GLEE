"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This still reflects a good deal for you considering the return on investment you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $900,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Explanation:  At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as your backup offer from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob, as he's unlikely to go higher and you're not willing to go lower. Taking the guaranteed $800,000 from John is the best move."
