Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. By offering $100, I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This allows room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
I'm offering $95, which is a compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92. Could you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $92 is still above Bob's initial offer and a decent compromise.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a lower price, and selling to John guarantees $120 but it also means potentially losing a potential customer like Bob for future sales. So, for now, I'll accept $92 and see if I can build a relationship with Bob for potential future transactions."
