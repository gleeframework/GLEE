"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100, it's a good deal.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50 compared to buying from John."
