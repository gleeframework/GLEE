"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",12000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $18000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $18000. I can do $17500, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15000.",17500.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $16000?",16000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not comfortable going below $18500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $18000?"
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $18000. I can do $18250, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15000.",18250.0,Alice,5,,
