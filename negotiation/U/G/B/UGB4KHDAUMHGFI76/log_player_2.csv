"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's fair considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Alice's value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to his budget, but still leaves room for negotiation. This initial offer shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but is also firm on his price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit,  how about $13,500? Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  Bob is likely to get a better deal if he keeps negotiating, potentially getting closer to his goal of $12,000. It's worth continuing the conversation for a few more rounds before exploring the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's increased his offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate, but is still trying to keep the price below his budget. This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Alice in the middle, hoping to close the deal without going over his $12,000 limit."
