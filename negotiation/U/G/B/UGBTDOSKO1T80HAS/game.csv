"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd need to see a lower price. Would you be willing to do $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about $8,750? This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to make a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm always willing to discuss options. However, $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's try $8,875. It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal.",8875.0,Alice,5,
