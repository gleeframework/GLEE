"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. He should reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in buying the product, but I'd need to see a lower price. Would you be willing to do $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While $9,000 is closer to his target, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting this offer will allow him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still a bit higher than my budget allows.  How about $8,750? This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I'm always willing to discuss options. However, $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's try $8,875. It's a fair compromise that gets us both closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,875 is very close to Bob's target price of $8,000.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer is increasing.  Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product and only pays a slightly higher price than his desired target."
