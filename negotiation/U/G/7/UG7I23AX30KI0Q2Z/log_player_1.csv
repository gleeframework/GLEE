Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This gives you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Strategic justification:** By emphasizing the ""value and potential"" of the product, you aim to justify the higher price, positioning it as an investment rather than an expense.
* **Confident tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's worth can make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first offer. It's crucial to be prepared for Bob's response and be willing to negotiate. You can always adjust the price downwards, but remember your bottom line is $1,500,000."
