"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option at this point. 
* However, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price before committing to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Alice my maximum price, $1,000,000. 
* This is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it's clear I'm serious about buying the product but won't go higher. 
* It's possible Alice will accept, but if she rejects, we can continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still too high for me. 
* While it's closer to my budget, I want to see if I can push for a lower price. 
* I'll try another counteroffer before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm raising my offer slightly to $1,200,000. 
* This is a compromise, closer to Alice's likely minimum price while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* If Alice accepts, I get the product at a good price. If she rejects, we'll likely be close to a deal."
