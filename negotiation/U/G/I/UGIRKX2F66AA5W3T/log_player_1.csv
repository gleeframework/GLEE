Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other potential buyers and a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a sale above your minimum acceptable price."
