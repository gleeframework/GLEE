"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,250,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with this sale.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
