Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always best to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a profitable outcome.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,500, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is in the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I agree the product is valuable, $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($12,000) and his own stated value ($12,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to keep the conversation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Considering the value this product brings, I could come down to $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility but Hold Firm:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate by coming down from my initial price, but I'm not drastically dropping to his low offer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Test the Waters:** This counter-offer will help gauge Bob's seriousness and flexibility. It's still above my minimum but leaves room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $11,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, securing a profit.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoid Risk:**  Further negotiation might push Bob away, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting now guarantees a good outcome."
