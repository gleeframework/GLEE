"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I agree the product is valuable, $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Considering the value this product brings, I could come down to $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
