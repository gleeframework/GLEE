{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves you with potential to make a profit, but also space to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This ensures Bob understands the offer and is more likely to respond. 

Remember, this is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $9500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly less than your minimum value of $15,000. It's worth trying to get closer to that number by counter-offering. There's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay a little more, especially if you make a compelling counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750?  It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate, but still holding onto a good price.
* **Closer to your desired price:** You're slowly working your way up to your goal.
* **A clear and reasonable compromise:** It's a good middle ground, making it more likely Bob will agree. 

Remember, you can continue to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses, always keeping in mind your minimum value and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I am willing to increase my offer to $10200 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of your item while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is closer to your minimum, but it's still significantly lower than your ideal price. You have a few options here:

* **Reject and Counteroffer:**  You can try to push for a higher price by making a counteroffer.  Perhaps you can offer $10,500, arguing that it's a reasonable compromise and a small increase from his last offer.
* **Sell to John:**  If you're impatient or want to guarantee a sale, you can always sell to John for $15,000. This ensures a higher profit, but you'll lose the potential for a slightly higher price with Bob.

The best choice depends on your risk tolerance and how much time you're willing to spend negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500. This would be a fair price that reflects the value of my product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **Higher than Bob's last offer:** This shows you're still open to negotiation, but holding onto a good price.
* **Closer to your minimum:** You're slowly but surely working your way up to your goal.
* **A clear and reasonable compromise:** It's a middle ground, increasing the chance Bob will agree.

Remember, you can always sell to John for $15,000 if you feel like you're not making progress with Bob.  But, keep in mind that you're getting closer to your minimum with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $10300 for your product. I believe this price is fair and within our range of agreement. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $10,300 is close to your minimum value, you've been through several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and it's clear he's not willing to go much higher.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum value of $15,000, which is a better outcome than accepting a lower price from Bob.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed profit."
