,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is very high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm open to further negotiation. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's be realistic. How about we meet in the middle at $1450000? This price is fair, acknowledges the product's unique features, and allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you moving closer, $1450000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen!",1350000.0,Bob,8,
