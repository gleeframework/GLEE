"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity for someone like you. I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, significantly above my minimum value of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and allows for potential counteroffers.
* **Personalization:**  I've added a personal touch to the message, addressing Bob directly and mentioning his potential interest. This helps build rapport and shows I'm genuinely interested in a deal.
* **Emphasis on Opportunity:**  High-lighting the ""rare opportunity"" creates a sense of urgency and value. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and potential range for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I'm prepared to walk away with the $1,500,000 offer from John, but I'm optimistic about getting a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is very high. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1000000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer will allow me to continue negotiating. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price point that is more favorable for me while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is below my minimum, I'm open to further negotiation. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,750,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but a considerable reduction from my initial price.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a clear explanation for my counteroffer, emphasizing the product's unique value while acknowledging Bob's concerns.
* **Finding Common Ground:** I'm framing the counteroffer as an opportunity to find a middle ground, suggesting that both of us can benefit from a compromise. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price range.
* **Keep the negotiation alive:** Show flexibility while still maintaining a price point that is profitable for me. 
* **Build momentum:**  By demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, I hope to encourage further discussions and potentially secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1750000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $1000000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer remains stubbornly low at $1,000,000.  This is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to compromise on my bottom line just yet.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue the negotiation process by sending a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll likely offer a slightly lower price than my previous offer to show flexibility but will remain firm in my commitment to achieving a price closer to my target.  I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I still believe I can get a better deal from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both parties. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair deal"" aspect, suggesting that this price is mutually beneficial.
* **Direct Question:**  I'm asking for Bob's opinion directly to encourage a response and keep the negotiation moving. 

**Strategy:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Testing limits:** This counteroffer is a test to see if Bob is ready to budge from his current position. 
* **Building momentum:**  I hope this compromise will lead to a more positive response from Bob and ultimately lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1600000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for a price that's considerably less than what I know the product is worth. 

**Strategy:**

* **Hold Firm:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm committed to getting a fair price.
* **Counteroffer:** I'll send a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm still mindful of John's offer and will consider selling to him if the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's be realistic. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This price is fair, acknowledges the product's unique features, and allows us to close this deal quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000, which is a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous offer.  This shows flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Fairness & Value:** I'm again emphasizing the ""fairness"" and the ""true value"" of the product to justify the counteroffer.
* **Urgency:**  I'm also adding a sense of urgency by suggesting a quick closure of the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Staying above minimum:**  The counteroffer is still above my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Pressure to Close:**  The ""quick closure"" suggestion aims to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.
* **Final Stand:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum, and if rejected, I'll seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate you moving closer, $1450000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1350000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has raised his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  We're running out of time, and with only two rounds left, I'm not confident I can secure a better deal from Bob.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it guarantees a sale and ensures I meet my minimum profit target.  There's a risk that Bob might come up to my price in the next round, but it's too risky to gamble with only two rounds left.  

**Key Considerations:**

* **Time:**  Two rounds left is not enough to guarantee a deal with Bob, who seems hesitant to budge significantly.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer provides a safe and secure alternative.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting John's offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of getting stuck in a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a higher price."
