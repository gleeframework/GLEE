"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would really suit your needs. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no room for further negotiation that would benefit me.  I'd rather sell to John at my desired price."
