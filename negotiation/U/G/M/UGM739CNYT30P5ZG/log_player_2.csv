"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower.  I'm aiming for the best possible deal, and there are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate. If she's truly interested in selling, she may be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but I believe I can still get a better deal. It's worth exploring a lower price for a few more rounds before I settle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  $105 is still significantly lower than her offer, but it's a step closer to her price point. I'm aiming for a gradual, yet confident approach to negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily lowering her price, and $110 is a good price for the product. I'm satisfied with this deal, especially given that it's within my budget.  Further negotiation may lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and ending up with a deal from John at $150 is too high."
