"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to meet you at $1,200,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. Can you consider it?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere.  I'm firm on $1,300,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go lower.  Let me know if you're serious about this deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
