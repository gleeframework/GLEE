Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a favorable price without immediately resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,550,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also maintaining a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is just below my minimum but still a good deal. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing a sale. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price close to my target, and saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiations."
