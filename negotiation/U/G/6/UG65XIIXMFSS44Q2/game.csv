"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. Can you consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to our desired value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $12,800, and that's as low as I can go. Please consider this final offer.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer and understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work, I'd need to see $13,200.  This is a compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices and would allow us to finalize this transaction.  Let's make this happen!",13200.0,Alice,7,
