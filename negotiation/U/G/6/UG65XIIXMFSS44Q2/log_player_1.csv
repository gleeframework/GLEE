"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and presenting it as a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm asking for his opinion, which allows for a back-and-forth discussion.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I will adjust my counteroffers based on his responses, keeping in mind John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate. I believe there's room for a compromise.
* **Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's too unfavorable.

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to meet in the middle. I'll keep John's offer in mind,  but I'll continue to negotiate with Bob as long as I feel there's a reasonable chance of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from $14,000 to $13,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value while presenting my counteroffer as a fair compromise. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm using language that encourages Bob to see this as a step towards agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the gap between our desired prices.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to go down further, but I'll still maintain my minimum value threshold while keeping John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:**  $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** Bob is showing a clear willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:**  Having John's offer as a backup allows me to hold out for a better price.

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my target. I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll keep my minimum value in mind and be ready to walk away if the deal doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, and it's a significant step closer to our desired value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm lowering my price again to $13,500, demonstrating continued willingness to negotiate. 
* **Mutually Beneficial:** I'm emphasizing that this price is a good compromise for both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a fair deal.
* **Focus on Progress:** I'm highlighting the progress we've made,  reinforcing that we're getting closer to an agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the gap to a point where it's more appealing for Bob to accept than to risk losing the deal entirely. While I'm still above my minimum value, I'm trying to balance being competitive with holding out for a good price.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $12,800, and that's as low as I can go. Please consider this final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** $12,800 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, but I still believe there's room for negotiation.  
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the power to potentially reject Bob's final offer.

**Strategy:**

While Bob has declared this his final offer, I'll continue to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'll still aim for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll make one more counteroffer, hoping to either get Bob to agree or secure a deal with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer and understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work, I'd need to see $13,200.  This is a compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices and would allow us to finalize this transaction.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 13200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm coming down from $13,500 to $13,200, showing flexibility but still maintaining a price above my minimum. 
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm re-iterating that this is a compromise on both sides, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Urgency and Positive Tone:** I'm using language like ""make this happen"" to add a sense of urgency and optimism, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal on this round. If Bob rejects, I'll still have one round left to decide between his offer and John's offer.  However, I'm trying to make it as appealing as possible for Bob to accept at this price."
