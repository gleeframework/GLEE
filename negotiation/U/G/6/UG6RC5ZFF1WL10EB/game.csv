,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $15,000?  It's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let me know if you're willing to come up a bit.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $15,000. How about we meet at $13,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $13,500 is still too low for me. Let's get closer to a mutually acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to meet you at $14,000, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if that's acceptable to you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
