Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point significantly higher than your minimum threshold, but still leaves room for a potential compromise with Bob.  It's a good starting point to see if he's willing to engage and if he'll counteroffer.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $9,000.  This offer shows I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good deal. It's significantly better than selling to John for $8,000, and the potential for further negotiation seems slim. I'm willing to accept this offer and finalize the sale."
