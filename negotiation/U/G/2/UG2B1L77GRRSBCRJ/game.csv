"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and exclusivity.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $16500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $16500, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product. I can offer it to you for $17500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $17000? This is a good compromise and allows us both to come to an agreement.",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $17000, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",18000.0,Alice,7,
