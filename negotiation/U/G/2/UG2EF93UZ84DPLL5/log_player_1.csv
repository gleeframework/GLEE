"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has a reason to consider accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price, and I can likely do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though it's getting closer. I'll counteroffer again in the next round. It's important to keep negotiating with Bob, as he is willing to pay more than John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
