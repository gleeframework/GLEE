Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
