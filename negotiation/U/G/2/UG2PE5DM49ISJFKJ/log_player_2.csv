"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value, and this offer stands for a limited time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even above her own product valuation. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer, saving you a significant amount of money."
