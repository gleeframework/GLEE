Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see some flexibility on your part.
