"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $850,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is still a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $775,000 is simply not enough for me.  I understand it's a lot of money, but consider this: it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and gives you a great deal.  Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
