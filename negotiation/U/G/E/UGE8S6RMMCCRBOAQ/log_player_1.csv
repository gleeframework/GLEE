"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $850,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is still a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. $775,000 is too low for me, and I am still confident I can get a better price. I will proceed to the next round and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $775,000 is simply not enough for me.  I understand it's a lot of money, but consider this: it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and gives you a great deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I will accept Bob's offer. It's my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate."
