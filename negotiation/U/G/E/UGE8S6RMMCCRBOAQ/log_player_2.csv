"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no need to rush into Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $850,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $775,000, which is still a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $775,000 is simply not enough for me.  I understand it's a lot of money, but consider this: it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, and gives you a great deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better deal by making a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and it's within my budget. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
