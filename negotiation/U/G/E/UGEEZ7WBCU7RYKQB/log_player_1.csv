Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $1,500,000 (your minimum) as possible. Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,400,000) gives him a potential ""deal"" while still netting you a significant profit. 
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below your minimum price.

**Important Note:** This assumes you cannot negotiate further with Bob if he rejects the initial offer."
