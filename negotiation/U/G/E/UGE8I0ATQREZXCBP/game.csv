"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my target price.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that's within my budget and reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This represents a significant discount for me, and it's also a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $9,500 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm prepared to go to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $9,375? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",9375.0,Alice,7,
