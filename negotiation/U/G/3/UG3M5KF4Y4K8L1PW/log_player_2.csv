While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still a bit higher.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit further and see if you can bring the price down to something more comfortable."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than what you're willing to pay. It's worth making another counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap."
