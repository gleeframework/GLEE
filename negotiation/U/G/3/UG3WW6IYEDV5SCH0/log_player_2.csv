Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
