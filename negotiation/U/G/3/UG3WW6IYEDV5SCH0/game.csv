"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm confident that this investment will bring you significant returns.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,450,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant amount for me and would make this a worthwhile deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
