"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  You're aiming to get the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible, and rejecting allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still within your budget of $1,000,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers and you'll be forced to buy from John at $1,000,000. Accepting the offer secures the product for a reasonable price within your budget."
