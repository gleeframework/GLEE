Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?

This is a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for $300,000 less than his maximum budget and Alice is unlikely to go any lower."
