"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to find a fair deal, $1,100,000 undervalues the product's true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,250,000 is still a little steep for me. Could we do $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
