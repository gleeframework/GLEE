Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties exist between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA, maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be a bit bolder in your initial offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** This offer starts closer to your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Confident Language:** Phrasing like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair deal"" projects value.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" emphasizes the product's worth to Bob.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give more negotiation room.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive offer might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob, but don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum!"
