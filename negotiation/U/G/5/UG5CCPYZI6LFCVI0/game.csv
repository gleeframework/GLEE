"Alice, that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let's see if we can work something out.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to go up to $100, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  To be honest, I'm making a significant compromise already, and $130 is the lowest I can go.  Do we have a deal?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $130 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
