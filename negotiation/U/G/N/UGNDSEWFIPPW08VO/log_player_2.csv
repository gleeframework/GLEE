Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a game-changer in its industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a product that's worth a lot more to you than that. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,200. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great price for a product that's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,600?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,600 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and it's a reasonable price below my $12,000 walk-away point and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing the deal."
