Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the good deal it represents. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, which is essential for a successful negotiation.
* **Back-Up Plan:**  I'm prepared to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 and well below the value I know the product holds.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. I can try to meet Bob halfway and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **John is a Safe Backup:**  While I want to maximize my profit, selling to John for $10,000 is always a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer ($9,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($7,000). This shows good faith and a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the product's value and the benefits Bob will reap. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Clear Counteroffer:** I'm stating my counteroffer price clearly and concisely.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal close to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you consider $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $7,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **John is the Safer Option:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a profit that meets my minimum requirement, while continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of losing time and potentially ending up with a lower price. 

It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John rather than risk further haggling with Bob."
