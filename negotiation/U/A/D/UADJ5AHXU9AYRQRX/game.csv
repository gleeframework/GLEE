"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the value is much higher. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to the value I think the product is worth.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000?  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,800 is still too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $9,200. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,200 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $9,200, which would be $9,000. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,6,
