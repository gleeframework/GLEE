"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1100000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1300000. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made concessions as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to give you a small chance to reconsider. I'll meet you at $1250000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
