"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget of $10,000. It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds left to potentially reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but  $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It demonstrates your interest while also setting a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,500 is tempting, I need to be closer to $10,500 for this to work for me. Let's meet halfway - how about $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is within your budget and meets your goal of saving as much money as possible. It's also a fair compromise given your counteroffer. While you could potentially negotiate further, it's not worth risking the deal with only 7 rounds left.  Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
