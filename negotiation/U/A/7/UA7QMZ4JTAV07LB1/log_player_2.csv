"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something I value at no less than $8,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as I know you'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or see if she'll come down closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
