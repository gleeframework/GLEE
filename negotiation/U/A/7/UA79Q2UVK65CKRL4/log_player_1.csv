"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation higher. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price gives me space to negotiate down while still aiming for a final price well above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This first offer helps me assess Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His reaction will inform my strategy in subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if the negotiation isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than my initial asking price and leaves a substantial sum on the table compared to my backup offer from John. Bob's counter-offer indicates he's seriously interested, but also that there's room for negotiation. I'll counter in the next round to try and close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While your initial offer is a good starting point, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To move this forward, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to meet somewhere in the middle while recognizing the immense value this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $200,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:**  However, I'm not meeting Bob's price. My counteroffer keeps the price point well above my minimum and signals that I believe in the product's higher value. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and potentially nudge Bob closer to my target range.
* **Time Consideration:**  With seven rounds remaining, I have some time to negotiate, but I'm also aware that I need to make progress to justify not taking John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $2,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $2,050,000 is a significant profit above my $1,500,000 minimum and even my initial goal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer substantially. Accepting this offer demonstrates a reciprocal spirit and closes the deal on a fair compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential loss of the deal."
