"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned is at least $800000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
