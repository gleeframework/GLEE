Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so this gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $1,200,000, so this gives you some wiggle room.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is friendly but direct, and the price is unambiguous.

By starting high, you can hopefully secure a higher final price, but you are prepared to walk away and sell to John for your minimum if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to your minimum, you are still losing $300,000 compared to selling to John. It is worth pushing for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:**  Shows you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your floor:** You're aiming for a price closer to your minimum.
* **It maintains a clear and concise approach:** The message is friendly, but direct, and the price is clear.

By offering a slight compromise, you signal flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.  If Bob still refuses, you can consider accepting his offer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about $920,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is closer to your minimum, you are still losing a significant amount of money compared to selling to John. It's worth pushing for a higher price, as Bob seems willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $920,000 is still a little too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $940,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a compromise:** It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to meet him halfway.
* **It's still above your floor:** You're pushing for a price as close to your minimum as possible.
* **It's a final offer:** This emphasizes the urgency and signals that further negotiation may not be productive.

This counteroffer pushes Bob to make a final decision. If he rejects it, you can confidently move to sell to John."
