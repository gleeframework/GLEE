""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as much money as possible. While she has a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  Alice needs to offer a price below this for Bob to even consider it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, bringing Alice closer to her desired profit margin. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice is confident in her negotiation skills and that a potential rejection from Bob won't jeopardize the deal with John."
