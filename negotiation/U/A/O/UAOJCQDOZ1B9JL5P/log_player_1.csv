I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to set the bar high and see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product.  I'm confident in the product's value and willing to negotiate, but I don't want to give away too much initially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm countering with $1,900,000. This is a reasonable compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price, considering my initial offer and Bob's potential interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and I'm not sure I can push him higher. Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a good price and avoid risking a lower offer from him or losing the sale entirely by selling to John."
