"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my maximum budget. Let's work together to close this deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $875,000.
