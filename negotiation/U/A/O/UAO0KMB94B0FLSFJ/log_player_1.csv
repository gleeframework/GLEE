"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, as it's below what the product is worth to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
