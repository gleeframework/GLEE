"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll be able to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less. How about $10,500?  That would be a good deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, as it's below what the product is worth to you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
