"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1100000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This price aligns better with what I am willing to pay while still reflecting the product's worth to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1050000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're close to reaching a decision, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is closer to $1100000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product to you for $1090000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.
