"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price would give you a good deal and still allow me to make a profit. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could we do $9,500? I think that's a fair price that would benefit us both.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my value.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, which is a significant concession. This is the lowest I can go, and still feel comfortable with the deal.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,
