"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $9,000. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I need to find a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price would give you a good deal and still allow me to make a profit. "", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $10,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Could we do $9,500? I think that's a fair price that would benefit us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $12,000. I will continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my value.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, which is a significant concession. This is the lowest I can go, and still feel comfortable with the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
