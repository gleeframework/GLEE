(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's maximum budget is $12,000.
* Alice's offer is $11,000, which is still within Bob's budget.
* However, Bob can get the same product from John for $12,000, which is the maximum he's willing to pay.
* Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject Alice's offer and purchase from John at his maximum budget limit."
