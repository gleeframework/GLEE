Round 5
Alice's offer:

To be completely transparent with you, I have a hard minimum of $1,000,000 for this product. I'm confident it's worth that and more to you in the long run. How about we settle at $1,100,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I do have another buyer who's offering $1,000,000 for the product. To be completely upfront, that's my absolute floor. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll need to move forward with the other offer. I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'd prefer to see you benefit from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that her absolute minimum price is $1,000,000. This is above your maximum budget of $800,000. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely you'll be able to bridge the gap. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your budget, making it the most sensible option at this point."
