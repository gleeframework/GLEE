"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but the gap is still too wide for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, but that's my limit. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  Let's try to bridge the remaining gap.  To be completely transparent with you, I have a hard minimum of $1,000,000 for this product. I'm confident it's worth that and more to you in the long run. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done while ensuring I receive a fair value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your transparency about your minimum price. I'm also committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $750,000? This is a significant investment for me, but I believe the product has the potential to be worthwhile at that price.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, I do have another buyer who's offering $1,000,000 for the product. To be completely upfront, that's my absolute floor. If you're unable to meet that price, I'll need to move forward with the other offer. I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'd prefer to see you benefit from it.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
