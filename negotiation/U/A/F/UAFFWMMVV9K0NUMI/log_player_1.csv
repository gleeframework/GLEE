"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and emphasize the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  While I want to make a sale, I need to make at least $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good value considering what this product can do for you.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low. I want to make as much profit as possible. I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $120 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with $110. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while providing a reasonable profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, it's taking too long, and I'm running out of rounds. John offers a guaranteed $150, which is my minimum and a better deal for me than potentially getting $110 from Bob."
