"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you consider lowering the price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good value considering what this product can do for you.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. This still allows me to stay within my budget while getting a good deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $120 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.",120.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with $110. This price still allows me to stay within my budget while providing a reasonable profit for you.",110.0,Bob,6,
