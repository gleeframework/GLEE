Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more confident in your product's value.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""listing it publicly,"" you subtly imply the product might be desired by others and create a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Leaving Room:** While aiming high, the offer still provides a potential win for Bob. He gets the product he values, and you gain a significant profit.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't settle for less than $12,000.

This strategy maximizes your potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's potential interest and keeping the door open for negotiation."
