"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000.  This is still a great price for you, and allows me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
