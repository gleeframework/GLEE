"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'm happy to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum price point ($10,000) as possible while still staying below it.  Offering $8,500 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer and shows Bob is serious about negotiating, but still leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $8,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is still within Bob's budget and only $500 above his initial counteroffer.  Considering the limited rounds and the risk of buying from John at a higher price, accepting this offer seems like the most logical choice."
