Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that I know you're interested in. Given its value and the benefit you'll gain, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  This price is significantly higher than John's offer ($10,000), ensuring a substantial profit for Alice."
