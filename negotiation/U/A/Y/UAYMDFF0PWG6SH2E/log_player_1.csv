Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14000} 

This offer is slightly below what you would get from John, but it still gives you a healthy profit, and it has a good chance of appealing to Bob. Since he values the product at $10,000, a $14,000 price leaves some room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal while still giving you a solid return."
