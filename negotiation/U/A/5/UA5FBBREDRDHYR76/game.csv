"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value, $1,050,000 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I can do $1,075,000, which is my absolute minimum for this product. This is the last time I'll be willing to negotiate, so I hope we can meet at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
