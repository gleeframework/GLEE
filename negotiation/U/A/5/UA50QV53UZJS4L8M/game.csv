"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, however, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
