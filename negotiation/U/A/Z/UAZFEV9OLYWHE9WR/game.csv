"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This still gives you a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
