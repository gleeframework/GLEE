"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. I believe this product will greatly benefit you and provide significant value at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the introductory price, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. In light of this, I would like to offer the product to you for $11,500. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** The $11,500 price tag is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, it's likely Alice won't budge much further. There's a risk that Alice might get frustrated and stop negotiating, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:** It's unclear if there's a time constraint, but Bob doesn't want to waste time if he can get a decent deal now.

Accepting the offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John, and there's a good chance that this is the best deal he'll get."
