Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're making a profit, as it's above your $120 minimum.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  It's below the value Bob places on the product, giving him a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to negotiate. 

Let me know if you want to proceed with Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is a bit lower than the initial offer, it's still above your minimum of $120 and a good profit. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and avoids further negotiation rounds."
