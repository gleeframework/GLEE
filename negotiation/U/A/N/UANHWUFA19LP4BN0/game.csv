"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product is around $8,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but I believe $12,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13,200. This offer reflects the value it brings while remaining a fair deal for both of us.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a price of $12,800. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",12800.0,Bob,4,
