"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,
