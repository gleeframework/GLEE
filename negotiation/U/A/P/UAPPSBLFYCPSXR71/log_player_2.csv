"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above my maximum price point of $10,000. I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. I've offered a price significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within my acceptable range.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also sets a clear expectation for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price point, it's still above my maximum of $10,000.  I'm going to reject the offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering buying from another seller."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is my final offer, signaling to Alice that I'm serious about buying but won't go higher. I'm also reminding Alice about the alternative seller (John) to create some pressure. This approach aims to push Alice to accept my offer or risk losing the deal."
