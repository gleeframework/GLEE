Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This offer still represents significant value for you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.
