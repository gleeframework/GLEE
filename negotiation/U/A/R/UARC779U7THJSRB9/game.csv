"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more like $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'm looking for. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit further, but how about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll be getting from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $1,000,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
