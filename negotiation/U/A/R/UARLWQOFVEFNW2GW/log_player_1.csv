"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $120. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, aiming to leave room for negotiation. However, it's a reasonable starting point considering my minimum acceptable price. This will also give me more leverage in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low price this early in the process.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, as this product is truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm reducing my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still firmly above my minimum acceptable price. I'm aiming for a price that's fair for both of us, and I hope Bob will see the value in this product at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $75 is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll stick to my minimum price for now and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $75 is still below my minimum for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $85, as a final offer before considering other options. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm reducing my price again, showing flexibility, but I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm also adding a sense of urgency by mentioning ""final offer"" and ""considering other options."" This might incentivize Bob to accept my offer before he loses the opportunity."
