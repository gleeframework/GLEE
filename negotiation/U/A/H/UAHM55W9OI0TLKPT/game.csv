,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $10,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a decent return on my investment.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about $10,125? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10125.0,Alice,7,
