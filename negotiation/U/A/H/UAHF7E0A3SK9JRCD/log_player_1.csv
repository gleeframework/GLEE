Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has immense value for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts and potentially negotiating."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I need to get. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair profit margin for both of us. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're looking for a fair profit margin, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 just doesn't cut it for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go down to $1,000,000. This is a great deal for you, and a fair price for me. It's the last offer I can make before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will meet my price point.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a solid profit and eliminates further negotiation."
