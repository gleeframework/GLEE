The product is worth $15,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $20,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $16,000, which is still a good deal for Alice, as she values the product at $15,000. This gives us room to negotiate, but it's also close enough to her asking price to incentivize her to accept."

Alice is still asking more than the product is worth to me.  It's better to keep negotiating and try to get a lower price."

I'm offering $17,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us."

Alice is not budging much, and I'm getting closer to my maximum price.  It's better to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
