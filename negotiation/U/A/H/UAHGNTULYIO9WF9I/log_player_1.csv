I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000.  This is a starting point for negotiation, and I believe it is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I am confident that I can get a higher price from Bob, but I am also willing to sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering Bob's offer and my own valuation.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure we'll be able to reach an agreement.  To avoid further negotiation, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
