"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the enthusiasm, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is limited.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to buy it right away.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise at $120. It's a fair price that's still a good value for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
