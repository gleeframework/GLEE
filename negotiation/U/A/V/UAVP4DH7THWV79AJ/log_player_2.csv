"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $18,000 is way above his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I'm interested in your product, $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above Bob's $8,000 limit.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible and can still potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still above what I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is getting closer to Bob's limit, he's already had a few rounds of negotiations and it's clear Alice is unwilling to go much lower.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, it's more beneficial to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John.  This guarantees a lower price and saves Bob further negotiation time."
