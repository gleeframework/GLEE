"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $11,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. How about we throw in some additional support and maintenance for the product, and I'll sell it to you for $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
