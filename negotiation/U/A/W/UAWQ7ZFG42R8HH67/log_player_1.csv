I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $120 is still too low, given it's worth $150 to him."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. But $120 is just too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $130. This is still a great value for you, considering it's worth $150 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
