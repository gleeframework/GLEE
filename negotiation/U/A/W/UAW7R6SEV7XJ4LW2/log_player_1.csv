"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. Let's see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value of $120. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still higher than my minimum value, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject and try to get closer to my desired price.  It's getting risky, but I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is my final offer.  It's a little lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the deal. If not, I'll have to take the safer option and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I've already made a few concessions, and there isn't much room for negotiation.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a bad deal. I'm going to sell to John to secure a guaranteed profit."
