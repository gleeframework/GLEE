"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I think you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However, $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for some room for both of us to profit. Let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1250000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1325000. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested!",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1325000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a fair price that considers your profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1300000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1285000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",1285000.0,Alice,5,
