Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price of $950,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I maximize my potential profit. 
* **Considering Bob's Value:** The offer is also significantly lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000). This makes it more likely that Bob will accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

* I want to secure a price as close to Bob's valuation as possible, but also be willing to walk away if necessary. 
* By starting high and then being open to counteroffers, I create a dynamic negotiation where we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
* If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth pursuing further negotiations or if I should switch to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal. I believe I can negotiate a better price, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  
* I will likely offer a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer, aiming for a compromise. 
* I'll continue to monitor my options with John to ensure I'm not losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer of $925,000 represents a compromise between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $900,000. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring I'm still getting a good deal. 
* **Room for Agreement:** This offer leaves room for a potential agreement while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* By moving closer to Bob's price point, I signal my desire to reach an agreement. 
* I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept. 
* However, I'll remain mindful of John's offer as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is lower than my previous counteroffer, it is still higher than John's offer of $800,000.  This represents a significant profit and is a good deal given the current negotiation dynamic.

**Strategy:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or of further price reductions. 
* **Secure Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profitable sale that's better than the alternative with John. 
* **Flexibility:**  While I'm accepting Bob's offer now, I'll remain open to potential future opportunities to sell the product for a higher price if they arise."
