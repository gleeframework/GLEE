Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that your asking price is reasonable.
* **Alternative Option:** By suggesting you have other options (""list it publicly""), you create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant. Remember, your absolute minimum is $12,000."
