"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's initial offer is above his maximum price point.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so he's starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but it might push Alice to be more flexible in her negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his ideal.  He has 7 rounds left, and with a bit more negotiation, he could potentially secure a better deal.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still trying to negotiate a lower price than Alice's latest offer, but he's moving closer to her position.  This strategy could potentially lead to a quicker agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is now at Bob's maximum price point.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffers and running out of rounds. It's safer to accept this offer and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at the same price."
