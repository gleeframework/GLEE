"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity with immense value, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking $1,400,000 for it, a price that reflects its true worth while leaving room for negotiation. Let's discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,300,000 to me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a more reasonable price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This price would give us both a good deal and allow us to close this transaction efficiently. Let's work together to find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
