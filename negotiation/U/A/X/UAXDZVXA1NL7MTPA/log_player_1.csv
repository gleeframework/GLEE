Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is much higher. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not giving the product away for less than you value it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a significant gap between your price and Bob's perceived value, allowing for some give and take.
* **It demonstrates your willingness to negotiate:** By offering a price, you're showing Bob that you're serious about selling and open to discussion. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while leaving room for a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, there's still room for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still leaves a good amount of value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not giving in completely to Bob's initial offer.
* **Fair Value:** You're still offering the product above your minimum while acknowledging Bob's lower price point.
* **Positive Language:** The message reinforces your willingness to work with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price.

This counteroffer maintains a balance between pushing for a better price and keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and call it $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,750 is very close to your desired price range, and it's significantly higher than the $8,000 you could get from John.  Accepting this offer maximizes your profit while still allowing for a successful negotiation with Bob."
