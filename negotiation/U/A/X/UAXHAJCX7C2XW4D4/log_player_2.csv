{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still very fair given the value it holds for me. I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is higher than $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1120000. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we may not be able to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. My next counteroffer is $1165000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,165,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counteroffer:** Alice's counteroffer is a decrease, bringing her closer to Bob's desired price. This suggests she's serious about closing the deal. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice increases. Buying from John would be a guaranteed deal, but at a higher price.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While there's still a difference between Alice's offer and Bob's ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and leaves room for potential future negotiation on other terms.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Alice's offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal completely and having to buy from John at a higher price."
