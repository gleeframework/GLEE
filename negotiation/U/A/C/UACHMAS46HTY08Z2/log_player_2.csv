"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still within my budget. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I can always make a counter-counteroffer or switch to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe there's room for Alice to come down a bit more. I will try to get a lower price by sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $9,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's latest offer of $10,500. This shows that I'm willing to meet halfway, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my budget. Hopefully, this will be attractive enough for Alice to accept, but I'm prepared to potentially switch to John's offer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still a bit too high.  I've already made a few counteroffers and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down further.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy from John for $8,000.  This ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with and avoids further negotiation."
