"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price that allows for a profitable sale for both of us.  I'm eager to finalize this deal if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond your initial assessment. It represents a significant investment on my end, and I need to ensure a fair return.  To move us closer, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I understand your position, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. As I said before, I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my intended use. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. Let's not waste any more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly anchored at $800,000. While accepting John's offer is tempting, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your directness. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $1,600,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of this product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly fixed on $800,000 and shows no sign of budging. Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 ensures a guaranteed and substantial profit, which is the primary goal."
