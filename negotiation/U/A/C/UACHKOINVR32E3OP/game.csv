"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, given its value to me.  This is a fair price that allows for a profitable sale for both of us.  I'm eager to finalize this deal if you're open to it.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond your initial assessment. It represents a significant investment on my end, and I need to ensure a fair return.  To move us closer, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  while I understand your position, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. As I said before, I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my intended use. I'm ready to close the deal at this price. Let's not waste any more time.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.  I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now.",800000.0,Bob,6,
