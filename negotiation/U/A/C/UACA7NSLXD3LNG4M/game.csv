"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
