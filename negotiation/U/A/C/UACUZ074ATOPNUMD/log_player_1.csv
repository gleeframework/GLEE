{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full desired price ($12,000) right away, giving Bob some space to negotiate.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a better price from Bob than his initial counteroffer. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $12,000, giving me the luxury to decline Bob's low offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer outright. I'm providing a counter-offer that demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Middle Ground:** My counter-offer of $8,500 is a compromise between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $6,000.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $8,500 is still a good deal.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer, my budget is firm.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** $7,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $8,000.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** While Bob is willing to negotiate, there's limited room for me to increase the price significantly.
* **John as a Guaranteed Buyer:** I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $12,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob is currently offering. This is a guaranteed sale that meets my minimum requirements.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially missing out on the better offer from John. 

I'm choosing to sell to John as it's the most financially advantageous option at this point."
