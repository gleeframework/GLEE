"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $20000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $17000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",17000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,,

"Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $17500. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping within my financial limits.",17500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're able to continue the conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet your counteroffer of $17500. I'm willing to go up to $18500, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,,
