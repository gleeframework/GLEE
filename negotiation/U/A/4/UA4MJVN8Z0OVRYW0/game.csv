"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think the product is worth more to you than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is my final offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
