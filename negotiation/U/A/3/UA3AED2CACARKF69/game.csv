"Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth significantly more than that. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider a lower price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $12000?  This is a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
