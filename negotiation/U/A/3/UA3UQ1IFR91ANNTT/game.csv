"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is a $2,000 value. With that, I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
