"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, so rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $12,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,500 is still more than you're comfortable paying.  You're only $3,500 away from your maximum budget, and there's always the option of buying from John.  Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is a $2,000 value. With that, I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, especially with the added warranty and maintenance package. However, even with those extras, the price is still $3,500 above your maximum budget. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, and you're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. To avoid the risk of going over your budget or exhausting your negotiation attempts, the best decision is to buy from John for $10,000. It's the most secure way to ensure you get the product within your desired price range."
