"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $750,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $875,000, which still reflects the value this product brings.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $800,000? This would allow us to move forward while respecting both our financial considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is the same as what John is willing to pay, so I'll accept it. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
