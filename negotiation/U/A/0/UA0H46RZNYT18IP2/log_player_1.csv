Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher offer from Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price. How about $90? I believe it's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $87 for the product. I hope this is a price you can consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum. I'm concerned that if I reject this offer, he might get discouraged and walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80. It's better to take the slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely."
