"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay that price for a product that's worth $8,000 to you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $8,250 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my budget.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,750. This price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. Let's close this deal now.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $8,375. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product.",8375.0,Bob,6,
