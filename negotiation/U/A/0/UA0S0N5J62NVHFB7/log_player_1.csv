"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit beyond my minimum of $8,000.  Let's see what Bob offers!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is still a good profit for me and hopefully close enough to Bob's valuation that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject it and see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price.  I'm starting to get a bit nervous about the possibility of John making a better offer, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $8,200. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully, it's close enough to Bob's valuation to convince him to accept.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, so I need to be more flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're running out of time. I'm starting to feel the pressure. While I would like to sell to Bob and potentially make a higher profit, I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might lose the opportunity altogether. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000 to guarantee I at least meet my minimum profit."
