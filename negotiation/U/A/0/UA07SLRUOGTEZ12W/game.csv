"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. My asking price is $1,000,000. This represents a substantial discount from its true value to you. I'm sure you'll find this a fair and mutually beneficial deal.  Please let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
