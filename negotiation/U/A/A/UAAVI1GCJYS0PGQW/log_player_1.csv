This offer starts at a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation. It also expresses a desire to reach a mutually agreeable price, making Bob feel like a valued customer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $9,000?  That's still a great price for this product, and it's closer to what I need to get for it."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I appreciate his willingness to meet in the middle, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
