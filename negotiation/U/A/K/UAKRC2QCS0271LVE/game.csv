"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $700000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's inherent value and the potential benefits it offers, I'd be willing to come down to $725000. This price still reflects a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $712500. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's more in line with what I'm comfortable paying.",712500.0,Bob,4,
