Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $120. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach my $100 limit. It's better to secure the product from John at the desired price than risk further negotiation with Alice."
