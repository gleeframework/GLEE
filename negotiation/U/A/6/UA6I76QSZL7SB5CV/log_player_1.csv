"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a final price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the high initial price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous that it would immediately offend Bob. We're aiming to open a dialogue and gauge his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our minimum and his own stated value for the product.  Accepting this offer would leave a lot of money on the table. We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and a guaranteed backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, my initial price takes into account the true potential of this product, which I believe is worth far more than your valuation. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We provide a brief but firm reason for rejecting Bob's offer, highlighting that it doesn't reflect the product's value.
* **Significant Move but Above Minimum:**  We make a significant price reduction to show willingness to negotiate but remain well above our $1,500,000 floor and closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Framing:**  We re-emphasize the product's ""true potential"" to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but I need to stick within my budget. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, it's still below what John is offering. We are moving in the right direction and have time for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. To show my commitment to making this deal happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Tone:** We acknowledge progress and maintain a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** This offer puts us slightly above John's offer, demonstrating our willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Appeal to Value:** We reiterate Bob's potential success with the product, adding a subtle emotional incentive. 
* **Time Consideration:** We are over halfway through the rounds. This offer pressures Bob to consider the diminishing opportunity for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you coming down, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now at a crossroads. Bob's offer is only $100,000 below John's guaranteed price. However, we've established a pattern of incremental movement, and Bob is consistently coming closer to our price. We have a good chance of securing a final price closer to $1,500,000 if we play our cards right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,525,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We acknowledge Bob's seriousness and make a final, firm offer to create urgency.
* **Split the Difference:** This common negotiation tactic creates a sense of fairness and compromise, even though it's slightly in our favor. 
* **Above John's Offer:** We stay above John's price, aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only a few rounds left, we add pressure for Bob to accept this strong offer."
