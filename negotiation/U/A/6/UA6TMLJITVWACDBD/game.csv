"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great price for such a unique product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $98? That's a fair price that works for both of us.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $98 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $102. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",102.0,Alice,5,
