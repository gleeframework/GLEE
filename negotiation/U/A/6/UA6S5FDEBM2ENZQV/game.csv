"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. I believe this product will be a valuable asset for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $9,000 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Could we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
