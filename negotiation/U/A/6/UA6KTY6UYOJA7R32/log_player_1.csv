I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a strong opening offer, allowing for potential profit while still being competitive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to secure a sale, I'm not willing to sell for that low. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but shows a willingness to compromise while leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. However, John's offer is still more appealing, and I'm comfortable selling to him."
