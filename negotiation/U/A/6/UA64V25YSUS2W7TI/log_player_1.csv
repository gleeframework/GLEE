{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. "", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases the likelihood of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.

By offering the product at $130, you leave Bob with $20 of perceived value ($150 - $130) which makes the deal attractive to him. At the same time, you secure a $50 profit ($130 - $80) if he accepts."
