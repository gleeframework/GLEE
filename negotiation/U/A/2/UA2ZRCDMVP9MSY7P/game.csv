"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer! While $8500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $9000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a little high for me.  I'm firm on $8500, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $8500. I'm willing to go a little lower than my previous offer, but I can't go any lower than $8750.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. If you're interested, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",8750.0,Alice,5,
