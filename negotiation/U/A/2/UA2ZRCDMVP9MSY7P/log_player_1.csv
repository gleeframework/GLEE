"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. $8,500 is still below my minimum threshold, but it's good to know he's interested. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer! While $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $9,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9000 is still a little high for me.  I'm firm on $8500, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his persistence, $8,500 is still below my minimum price point. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $8,500. I'm willing to go a little lower than my previous offer, but I can't go any lower than $8,750.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it's a fair compromise. If you're interested, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8750}
