"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is better than Alice's initial asking price, you can still do better. You have a clear alternative with John who is selling the product for $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you can get the product for $120 from John, your counteroffer should be close to that.  $125 gives Alice some wiggle room but is still a good price for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is $140. This is only slightly better than her initial offer of $135 and is still above your maximum price of $120.  It's now more beneficial to buy the product from John for $120, ensuring you get the best possible price."
