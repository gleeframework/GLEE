"Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I'm confident it holds similar value for you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,750,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let me know your thoughts.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
