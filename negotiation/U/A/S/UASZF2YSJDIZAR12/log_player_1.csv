I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is a good deal for me.  It's closer to my minimum than John's offer, and it ensures I close the deal within the allotted rounds."
