"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $980,000.
