"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This recognizes the product's value while offering you a significant discount from the initial offer.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is cutting it too close. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,600,000, and even if she slightly budges, it's not worth the risk of missing out on John's guaranteed price of $1,200,000.  It's time to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the deal with John."
