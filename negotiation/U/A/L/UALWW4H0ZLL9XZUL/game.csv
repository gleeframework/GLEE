"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This recognizes the product's value while offering you a significant discount from the initial offer.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,750,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is cutting it too close. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
