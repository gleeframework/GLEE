"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $150 for this product. How about we split the difference and agree on $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50?",127.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $127.50 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can close this deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $130, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
