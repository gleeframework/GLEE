"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. It's a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with an offer of $120 for the product.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $95. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider $95, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, and I think $105 is a fair price for this high-quality product.",105.0,Alice,5,
