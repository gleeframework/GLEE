"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product is truly one-of-a-kind and will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  ",900000.0,Alice,3,
