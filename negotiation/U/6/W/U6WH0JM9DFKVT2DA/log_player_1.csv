"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but I want to see if I can get a good starting point. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'm hoping to get a good deal in these first few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for anything significantly lower than my minimum. I'm still confident I can secure a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum is $8,000, and I want to avoid selling to John at that price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more.  I have a few more rounds left, so I'm not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $8,200. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that this price is fair, considering his valuation and my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. $6,800 is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to take such a big loss.  I have a few more rounds, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $8,000. We're nearing the end of the rounds, so I'm hoping Bob will realize that this is the best offer he's going to get from me. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'd rather sell to him than to John at the same price."
