Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd ideally want to pay less than that.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Sense of Exclusivity:**  The message hints at the product's high demand and Bob's privileged position as the first recipient of the offer.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Deal with Bob:** The price is attractive enough to entice Bob while still being highly profitable for you.
2. **Maximize Your Profit:**  You aim to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible.
3. **Provide a Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still rely on John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
