Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you something incredibly valuable. I know it's worth a million dollars to you, and I won't sell it for a penny less to anyone else.  However, I'd like to give you the first chance. What do you say to a price of $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Value:**  Since Bob values the product at $1,000,000, that's the absolute maximum he'd be willing to pay.
* **No Room for Negotiation:** By starting at Bob's maximum price and stating you won't go lower, you eliminate his ability to negotiate you down.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** While you could aim slightly higher, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, and you'd get the same $1,000,000 from John. This strategy ensures you get the best possible price while guaranteeing a sale."
