"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,
