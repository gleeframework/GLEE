"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $20000. It's a fantastic opportunity and I believe it's a fair price. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Can we meet in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $18000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $19000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. Let's try to make this deal happen.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $19000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17500. Can we meet in the middle again?",17500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $17500 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $18500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16500. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $17000 as a final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",17000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $17000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16000. I'm trying to get as close to my target as possible.",16000.0,Bob,8,
