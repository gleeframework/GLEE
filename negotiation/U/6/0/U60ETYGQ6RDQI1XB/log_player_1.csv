Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to aim slightly lower to entice Bob while still maximizing your potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $149 is just below your guaranteed price and significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob while still netting you a profit close to the maximum. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and highlights the offered price, making the decision easy for Bob."
