"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $750000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $900000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make a bit more. I can offer it to you for $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1050000 is getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $950000. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $950000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I can offer it to you for $1050000. However, I want to make it clear that this is my final offer, and if you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
