"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, as a compromise.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and it's closer to your offer.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
