Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify that price at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the potential value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1250000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price to make it work.  Would you be willing to go down to $1150000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that you've already lowered your initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that Bob's interest in the product will motivate him to increase his offer further. I'll counteroffer with a price that's a compromise between his current offer and my desired price."
