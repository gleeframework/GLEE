"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $105. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested!",105.0,Alice,5,
