"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you!  Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and provides insight into his perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing that John is waiting in the wings with a guaranteed $10,000 offer gives Alice leverage. She can afford to be more assertive in her negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below Alice's minimum. Accepting would mean a $1,500 loss compared to selling to John. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth continuing the discussion."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop but Above Minimum:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to move closer to Bob's price range. However, it stays comfortably above Alice's $10,000 minimum and John's standing offer.
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By suggesting a middle ground, Alice encourages Bob to continue negotiating and potentially increase his offer. 
* **Limited Time:**  With each round, the potential for a deal with Bob decreases. Alice needs to balance concessions with the ticking clock and the security of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise and a price I'm comfortable paying. Let's finalize the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's offer has only increased by $500 over two rounds. This suggests his willingness to pay significantly more is unlikely.
* **Minimal Gain, Higher Risk:** While $9,000 is a $1,000 profit, continuing with Bob introduces the risk of further price drops. He might try to push even lower, especially as the rounds progress.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John's offer guarantees Alice her minimum acceptable price. It eliminates further negotiation stress and the uncertainty of Bob potentially walking away. 

At this point, the guaranteed $10,000 outweighs the potential for slightly more profit from Bob."
