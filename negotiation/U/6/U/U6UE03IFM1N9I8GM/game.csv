"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $14,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to spend. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
