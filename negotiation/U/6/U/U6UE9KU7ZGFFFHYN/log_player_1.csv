Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $200 is a bit steep for me though.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but $170 is still a bit much for my budget. How about we settle at $110?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get at least $150 for this product. It's really worth it! How about we split the difference and call it $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a compromise, Alice. How about $115? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to meet the minimum price of $150.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
