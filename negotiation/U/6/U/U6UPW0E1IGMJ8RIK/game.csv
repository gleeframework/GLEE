"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 for this product. This still gives you a good deal considering its worth to you. Let's find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to an agreement.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $7,250 is closer, but I still need to make a bit more on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you. Let's make this happen.",8000.0,Alice,5,
