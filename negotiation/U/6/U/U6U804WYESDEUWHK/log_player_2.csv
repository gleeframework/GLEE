# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you have a fallback option with John, there's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000.

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000, so I'm counteroffering at $1,137,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,137,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,137,500

At this point, Alice is clearly not willing to budge much further.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance you'll end up paying more than John's price of $1,000,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
