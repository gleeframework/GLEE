"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a product that is truly unique and valuable.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm hoping we can agree on a price that's a bit more manageable for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid $800,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",825000.0,Alice,5,
