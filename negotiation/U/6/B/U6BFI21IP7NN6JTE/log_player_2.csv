"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,500.**  This is less than your maximum budget of $12,000. 
* **Buying from John would cost you $12,000.** This is more than Alice's offer. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option as it allows you to save $1,500 compared to buying from John."
