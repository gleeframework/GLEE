Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation increases the chances of him accepting while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,500 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Value & Alternative:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, selling it quickly to Bob at a higher price is more desirable."
