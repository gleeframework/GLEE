"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's something that could be incredibly beneficial to your operations, and I believe its worth to you is significantly higher than the price I'm willing to accept.  I'm asking for $1,400,000, which is still well below its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value of the product ($1,400,000 vs $1,200,000).** This means there is still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially get a better price.** Even if you end up buying from John, the outcome is still better than accepting Alice's offer.  

By rejecting, you are setting the stage for further negotiation with Alice or potentially finding a better deal elsewhere."
