"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is my best price for now, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer before I explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm hoping you'll accept it. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement, and I don't want to miss out on the opportunity to sell to you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's worth closing the deal at this point.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and my previous offer of $1,150,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,137,500. Let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",1137500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price, but $1,137,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,120,000. This is my final offer, and I don't want to miss this opportunity, but I need a little more from you.",1120000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need a bit more assurance that we can finalize the deal. I'll offer you a slight concession: I'll throw in a small warranty and support package, which is worth an additional $10,000. So, I'm offering the product to you for $1,130,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this point.",1130000.0,Alice,9,
