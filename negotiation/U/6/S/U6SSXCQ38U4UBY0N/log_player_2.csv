# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You want to save as much money as possible. $9,500 is still above your budget, so it's best to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

You're still aiming to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible.  $9,000 is still a bit too high, so it's worth another round of negotiation."
