{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for me to make concessions if Bob counteroffers. It also frames the deal in a way that makes it seem like a win for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9500 is a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to push for a higher price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still allows me to make a profit while offering you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9000, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'm really hoping to get it for $8750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and it's the highest I can go right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept it because I think it's unlikely he'll go higher, and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer altogether."
