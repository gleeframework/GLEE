```

Bob has reached his limit. He's been trying to negotiate a better price with Alice, but it's not getting him any closer to his goal of $100.  Since he's already at Round 7, he doesn't want to risk losing the deal altogether. John is offering a guaranteed price of $100, which is the best option for Bob at this point."
