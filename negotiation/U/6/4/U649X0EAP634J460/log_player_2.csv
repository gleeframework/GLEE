"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what Alice values the product at.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price.  He has the option of buying from John for $15,000, so he has some leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $12,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This price is still within Bob's budget of $15,000 and represents a good compromise, giving Alice a decent profit while allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away or make a counteroffer that is too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
