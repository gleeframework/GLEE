Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. I want to start strong but also leave room for a compromise if Bob counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm aiming for, but it's not too far off. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. This is a slight reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and lead to a successful deal."
