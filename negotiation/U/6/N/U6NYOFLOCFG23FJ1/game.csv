,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $85, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $90 is a fair price, considering the value of the product to me and the fact that you're still making a profit. Let's make this deal happen!",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to the price you're willing to pay, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",95.0,Alice,7,
