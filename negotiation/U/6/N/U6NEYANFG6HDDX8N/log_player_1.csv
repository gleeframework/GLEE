"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and engaging tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full $120 immediately, as that might be too aggressive and lead to an immediate rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.**  While it's tempting to take $100, I'm committed to getting closer to my desired value. 
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.** There's still room to compromise, but I want to see if I can get Bob to move closer to my price.  

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Middle Ground:**  $110 is midway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping the tone friendly can help keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment. Would it be possible for us to meet at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob is getting closer, his offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More room for negotiation:**  I've already compromised twice, and there's still room to find a middle ground without losing too much.
* **Risk of selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum, but I still believe I can get closer to $120 with Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle between $105 and my previous offer of $110."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep working with you. I'm willing to go down to $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, I think. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 107.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my last offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $105.
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm still keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging.

**Reasoning for not selling to John:**

While selling to John would guarantee my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price with Bob. I've made several concessions already, and I believe I'm close to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I would like to propose $106 as our final price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $106 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited rounds left:**  We're down to only 4 rounds, and I need to be strategic about maximizing my profit. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  While selling to John guarantees $120, I'm still hopeful I can negotiate a higher price with Bob. I believe we are both nearing a point where we are willing to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still below my minimum, hoping to find a compromise and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and we're almost there!  I'm willing to go down to $109 for this final round.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 109}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final round push:**  I'm increasing my offer by a small amount to show commitment and urgency, hoping to entice Bob to make a final concession. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  $109 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's a good compromise point.
* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept.

**Why not sell to John:**

While selling to John guarantees $120, I believe there's still a good chance I can secure a better price with Bob. I've shown flexibility, and this final offer is a significant step towards a deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're down to our last two rounds. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $107 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Risk of no deal:**  There's a significant chance Bob won't budge further, and I risk not closing a deal at all.

**Decision:**

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum of $120, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with the product at a lower price."
