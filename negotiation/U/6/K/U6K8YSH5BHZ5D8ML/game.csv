"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $1,000,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $1,300,000. How about we split the difference and I pay $1,150,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I can do $1,250,000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
