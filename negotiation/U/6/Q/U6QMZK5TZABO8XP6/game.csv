"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is the best I can do at the moment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is closer to my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already come down significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
