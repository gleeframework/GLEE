{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value of $800,000. This gives Alice an incentive to negotiate while also demonstrating Bob's seriousness about securing a deal."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is getting closer to John's price of $1,200,000.  While there is still room for negotiation, the potential savings are diminishing.  At this point, it is more beneficial for Bob to purchase from John and avoid further negotiation."
