"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, reflecting the value this product brings. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is fair considering the value you place on the product and allows you to meet your minimum.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
