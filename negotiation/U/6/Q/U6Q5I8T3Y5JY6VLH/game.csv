"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider  $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle of our previous offers at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a bit more in line with your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to come down another $500. I'll offer you the product for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
