,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1000000 doesn't fully reflect the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential this product offers.  Let's find a mutually agreeable solution.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $1150000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $1125000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
