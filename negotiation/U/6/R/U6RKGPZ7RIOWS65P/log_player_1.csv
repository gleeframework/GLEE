"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe there's potential for a higher price.  I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,000,000 doesn't fully reflect the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate the offer, but $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's a step in the right direction, I still believe I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if this deal falls through."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in this product.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer. While $1150000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $1125000? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like more, I'm getting closer to my minimum and there are only a few rounds left.  It's a good deal, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk losing him completely."
