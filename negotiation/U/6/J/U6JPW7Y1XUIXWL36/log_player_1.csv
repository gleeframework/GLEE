"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, $1,500,000. This is a bold strategy, but I believe it's necessary to see how much Bob values the product. If he rejects this offer, I can gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept anything less than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate, while still holding firm on the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,200,000, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again in hopes of finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, but I want to see if we can finally meet somewhere in the middle.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe there's a chance we can reach a better agreement with a few more rounds of negotiation.  I will counteroffer again and see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to meet Bob halfway.  I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession, and I'm hoping it will convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only a few rounds left, I can't risk a counteroffer from Bob that might be even lower.  I've made significant concessions, but Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John and avoid the risk of losing even more money."
