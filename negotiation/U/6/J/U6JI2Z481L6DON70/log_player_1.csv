It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob is refusing to budge on his price. I've already gone down significantly from my initial asking price, and I don't think I can get any closer to my target without risking losing the deal. 

John is a guaranteed sale at a much better price for me. It's time to move on and sell to John."
