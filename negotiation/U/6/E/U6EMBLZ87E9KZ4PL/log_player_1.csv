Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $15,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my fallback price creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the price is firm, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a quicker sale.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, justifying the price and potentially swaying Bob towards a deal.

By positioning the price strategically, I increase my chances of a profitable sale to Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
