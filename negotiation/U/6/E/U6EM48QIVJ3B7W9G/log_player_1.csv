"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $7,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $10,000.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price still offers you a significant savings, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $8,500 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Could you do $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $7,500 is closer than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $7,500 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a great price for both of us. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
