This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for both of us.  It also allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for both of us to make a profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation,  $850,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

This gives you a good deal, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This offer gives you a significant profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach an agreement."
