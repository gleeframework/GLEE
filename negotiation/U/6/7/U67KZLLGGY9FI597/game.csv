"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I agree this product could be valuable, but that price point is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is significant, and $900,000 is quite a bit below what I'd be willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure this is still a worthwhile deal for me.  Could we settle at $985,000?",985000.0,Alice,5,
