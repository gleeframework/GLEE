Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is significant, and $900,000 is quite a bit below what I'd be willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $15,000 less than John's offer and considerably less than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has steadily lowered her price, indicating a willingness to make a deal.
* **Time Investment:** Continuing to negotiate might yield smaller gains, but there's a risk Alice could become less flexible.

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether."
