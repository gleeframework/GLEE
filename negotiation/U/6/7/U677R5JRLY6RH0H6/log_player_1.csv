"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential willingness to pay the full value.  It's a bit of a gamble, but if he rejects, we can negotiate down from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm coming down slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I believe this is a fair compromise and might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm now offering my minimum price.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John and be done with the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price.  I've lost some profit, but I've saved myself further negotiation and the risk of getting a worse deal."
