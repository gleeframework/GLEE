Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget, I am only able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value, but it also shows my willingness to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
