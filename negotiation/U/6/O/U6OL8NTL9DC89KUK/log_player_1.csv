{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  It's still a great price for a product this valuable."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about buying this product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $12,000 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle - $13,500. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $13500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I only have a few rounds left. I'm not sure I can get him up to $15,000, so it's better to take the sure thing with John."
