Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15000.  It's still a great price for a product this valuable.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about buying this product.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $12000 just isn't enough for me. Let's meet in the middle - $13500. This gives us both a good deal. What do you say?
