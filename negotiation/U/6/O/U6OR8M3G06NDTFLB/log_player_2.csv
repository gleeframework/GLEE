"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or, if that fails, he can still buy from John for $10,000."
