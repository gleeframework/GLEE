Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product holds a value of $1,200,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your earnings, aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,050,000 leaves a reasonable margin for Bob ($150,000) while securing a substantial profit for you ($250,000 over John's offer). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, the message implies some flexibility for negotiation if Bob were to counter."
