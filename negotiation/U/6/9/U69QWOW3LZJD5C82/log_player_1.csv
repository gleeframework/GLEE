"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high price, but leaving room for negotiation. It's a strong opening that reflects the product's value to me while acknowledging Bob's potential gain.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $850,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm to a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm confident that Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the same as before, but we've already rejected it once. There are only 6 rounds left.  It's time to be practical.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $850,000 is a significant sum and still well above my minimum.  Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation failures."
