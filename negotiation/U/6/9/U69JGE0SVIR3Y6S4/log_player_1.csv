Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This also allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, giving me a chance to assess his interest and potentially reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value of $100 and less than the offer from John.  I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although $78 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident that John will buy the product at $100, so I will choose to sell the product to John."
