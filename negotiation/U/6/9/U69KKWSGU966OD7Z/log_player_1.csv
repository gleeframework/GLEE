Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, I want to start with a significantly higher offer to see if I can secure a higher profit margin. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  The $15,000 offer gives Bob the impression that I'm willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a price higher than my minimum of $10,000.
* **Backup Option:**  I'm not risking a loss because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. 

This strategy aims to balance ambition with the security of a guaranteed sale."
