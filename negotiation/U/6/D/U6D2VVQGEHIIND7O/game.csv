"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1400000.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This would still be a good deal for you considering the product's worth, and it's the closest I can go right now. Let's see if we can make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1600000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1550000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
