"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I've done some research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for a unique product like this.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you've done your research, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit low for this product. Considering its unique features and potential value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $850000 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800000. This product has a lot of potential and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $800000. My new counteroffer is $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
