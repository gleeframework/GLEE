"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's offer of $14,000 and your ideal price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point for further negotiation, giving you a good chance of securing a deal while still saving some money."
