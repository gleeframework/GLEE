"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is motivated to sell:** She values the product at $1,000,000 and is aiming for a profit.
* **You have a fallback option:** John offers the product at your maximum price ($1,500,000), ensuring you won't be left without it.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. She might come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
