"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Starting Point:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" emphasizes the product's worth and subtly suggests that my asking price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone encourages engagement and portrays a willingness to negotiate. 
 
This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Starting high creates the possibility of securing a deal well above both my minimum and Bob's valuation.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response to this initial offer will reveal how eager he is to buy and provide insight into his negotiation strategy. 
 
It's important to remember that I have the safety net of John's offer, allowing me to confidently negotiate with Bob without the pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far too high for my budget. Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. Let's start with a realistic price and see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's shown a willingness to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount, especially when I have John's guaranteed offer. By rejecting and counter-offering, I can try to guide the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $2,300,000 is a significant jump from your offer. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial reduction from my initial price to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Ground:** However, the counteroffer is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. This maintains pressure on Bob while leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** Framing the price reduction as a ""middle ground"" emphasizes fairness and encourages a collaborative approach to the negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  The significant price drop prevents a stalemate while still pursuing a strong outcome.
2. **Test Bob's Flexibility:** His response will reveal how much he's willing to budge from his initial offer.
3. **Maintain Control:**  By staying above my minimum and John's offer, I retain control and the option to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This shows my genuine interest in the product, but it's important to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below John's offer of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for him to increase his bid further. I'll reject this offer and present a counter-offer aiming to settle somewhere between our two current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. It seems we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm proposing $1,650,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the product's value is recognized."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Positioning:** I've positioned my counteroffer strategically between Bob's offer ($1,300,000) and my previous price ($1,900,000) as well as above John's standing offer ($1,500,000).
* **Highlighting Compromise:**  By explicitly stating this is a ""significant compromise,"" I aim to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While showing flexibility, I am still holding firm above my guaranteed fallback option (selling to John).

This approach aims to:

1. **Encourage Movement:** The compromise might motivate Bob to make a significant jump in his next offer.
2. **Maintain Profitability:** I'm still aiming for a price well above Bob's initial offer and my minimum acceptable price. 
3. **Control the Negotiation:** My willingness to walk away if needed gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,650,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a substantial increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my serious interest in acquiring the product.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting close to John's offer, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  While his offer represents a substantial increase, we are now in the later stages of the negotiation, and I want to push for a price closer to my initial offers. Bob has consistently shown a willingness to move upward, and I want to leverage that in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're definitely in the ballpark now. You've been a dedicated negotiator, and I respect that. To meet you halfway, let's make it $1,525,000. This reflects my final offer, acknowledging your commitment while fairly valuing this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession:** I've lowered my price slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise but remaining firm above John's offer.
* **Justification:** Emphasizing Bob's ""commitment"" and the ""unique"" nature of the product reinforces the value proposition.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds remaining, this firm stance encourages Bob to make a move closer to my target price or risk losing the deal. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Secure a Favorable Deal:** It positions me to gain a significant profit above both my minimum and John's offer.
2. **Prompt Decision:** The ""final offer"" element encourages Bob to make a concrete decision quickly.
3. **Maintain Control:** I retain the option to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my terms in the remaining rounds."
