"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,300,000 is far too high for my budget. Considering the value I'm placing on the product, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. Let's start with a realistic price and see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $2,300,000 is a significant jump from your offer. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still valuing the product fairly.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm happy to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This shows my genuine interest in the product, but it's important to find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
