"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit above my minimum of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is significantly closer to my desired price than my initial offer, and it's above my minimum of $80. Accepting his offer is the best option in this scenario."
