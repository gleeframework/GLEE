"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, we believe it's worth $950,000. Please let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). 
* You have a clear advantage in negotiation as you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but there's room for negotiation.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This seems like a fair price considering your potential profit and my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a revised price of $900,000 for our product. This still represents a significant profit for us while being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal is more aligned with what you're looking for.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* There's potential to get a better price by making another counteroffer. 
* Buying from John at $1,200,000 is not a good option at this stage, as we're trying to save money."

{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $900,000 is still above my target price.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $890,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize it."", ""product_price"": 880000}
