"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have multiple rounds to work with, so there's no need to rush into a deal that isn't favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your maximum budget. It's a firm offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to come down a bit. By starting with your maximum, you establish a clear boundary and give Alice an incentive to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $140 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $130 is still above your budget. There's still room to negotiate, and you have 7 rounds left. It's worth trying to push for a lower price before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. "", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price between your initial offer and Alice's last offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate while still staying within your budget. By offering a ""halfway"" price, you're appealing to Alice's sense of fairness and increasing the likelihood of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, $125 is still above your budget. You have 5 rounds remaining and can still try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget.  Let's split the difference and settle on $110. This is a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is another compromise, again splitting the difference between your previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget.  By offering a ""split the difference"" price, you appeal to Alice's desire for a quick and easy solution and increase the likelihood of a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $117. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair deal considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $117, which is still above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, you only have 3 rounds left. It's a risk to keep trying to get a lower price, as Alice may not budge further, and you could end up with no deal.

Given the time constraints, it's more strategic to purchase from John for $100. This guarantees you get the product at a price you're comfortable with and ensures you don't miss out on a deal altogether."
