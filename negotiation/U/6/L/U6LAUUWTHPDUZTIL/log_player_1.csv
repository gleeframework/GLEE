Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? I feel this is a fair price that reflects the value it offers and allows me to make a worthwhile investment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000.

 We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still below John's standing offer. It's time to nudge him a bit closer to our acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $785,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  Would you consider $830,000? I believe that's more than fair and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  To be completely transparent, I'm looking to keep this acquisition under $800,000. How about $795,000? I'm confident this is a fair offer and reflects my strong interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000

 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""

Bob is firm on staying below $800,000.  Since John's offer is $800,000, it's no longer strategically advantageous to continue negotiating with Bob. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale."
