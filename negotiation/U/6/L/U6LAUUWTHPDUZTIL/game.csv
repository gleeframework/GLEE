"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your aspirations, potentially worth a million dollars to you in the long run.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $875,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the value this product brings.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $785,000? I feel this is a fair price that reflects the value it offers and allows me to make a worthwhile investment.",785000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $785,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line.  Would you consider $830,000? I believe that's more than fair and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",830000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely in the ballpark now.  To be completely transparent, I'm looking to keep this acquisition under $800,000. How about $795,000? I'm confident this is a fair offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",795000.0,Bob,6,
