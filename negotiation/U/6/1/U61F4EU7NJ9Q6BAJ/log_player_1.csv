{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also aware of John's offer of $15,000, so I'm willing to accept a price no lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's a compromise, but still closer to my initial price and within a reasonable range for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to take the risk of another round and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price to $14,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offers, but it's still above Bob's latest offer and closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price I'm satisfied with.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and Bob's offers have only increased incrementally.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is more important than trying to squeeze out a few extra dollars from Bob."
