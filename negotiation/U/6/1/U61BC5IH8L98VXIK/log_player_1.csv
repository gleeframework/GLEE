Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, $120 is quite a bit below its value. Could you do $170? That's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 
Explanation: While we could push for a bit more, accepting $140 is a good deal. It's a significant profit above our minimum, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale entirely."
