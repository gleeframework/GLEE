"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you've expressed interest in. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it can be of significant benefit to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000.
* **You save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, the information provided doesn't indicate that you have any leverage to do so. It's a good deal for you, so accepting it is the most logical choice."
