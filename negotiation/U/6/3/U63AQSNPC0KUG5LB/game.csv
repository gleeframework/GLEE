"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $75 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $87.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about $82.50?  It's a good middle ground, and I think we can both be happy with that.",82.5,Bob,4,
