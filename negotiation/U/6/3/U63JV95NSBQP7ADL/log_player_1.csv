"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit for myself.  I'm confident Bob will find this appealing, but if he rejects, I'm prepared to counter and potentially even move on to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, hoping to capitalize on Bob's clear interest in the product. If he rejects again, I'll reconsider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn. I'll accept his offer and move on."
