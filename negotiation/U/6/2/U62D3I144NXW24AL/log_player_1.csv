Round 2
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a better price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Offer:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500,000) and a good return overall.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is unlikely to go higher.  We've both compromised, and further haggling might be counterproductive.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging this out longer risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures the sale."
