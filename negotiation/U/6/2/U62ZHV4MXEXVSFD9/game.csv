"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm thinking something closer to  $800,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I could come down to $1,900,000. This offer reflects the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still quite a gap from what I'm willing to pay.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is appealing, I need to see a price that reflects the real value of this product.  Would you be willing to consider $1,600,000? I'm confident it's a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  I feel this is a fair compromise and reflects the value I place on the product.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be candid, I have another offer on the table for $1,500,000. To make this work for me, I'd need to see you at $1,450,000.  This would allow me to move forward with you knowing I'm getting a fair deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  I can go up to $1,375,000, but that's my absolute limit. It's a strong offer, and I think it's fair given the other options I have available.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
