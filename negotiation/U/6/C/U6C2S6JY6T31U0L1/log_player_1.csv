Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, still landing you a price significantly higher than your fallback option (John at $8,000). 
* **Confident Approach:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the price as fair and justified."
