,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a great price for a product of this quality. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $100 is a bit higher than my initial target, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $95 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.  Let me know your final decision.",102.5,Alice,5,
