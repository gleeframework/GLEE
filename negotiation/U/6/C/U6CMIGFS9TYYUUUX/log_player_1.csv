Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm starting with a price of $100. It's a good starting point that's higher than my minimum but still potentially attractive to Bob. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $95. It's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 94}

I'm counter-offering with $94.  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I still believe I can get a slightly better price. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so it's important to try to close the deal."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping to get $94, $93 is still a good price and we're running out of rounds. It's better to close the deal now than risk getting nothing if we keep negotiating."
