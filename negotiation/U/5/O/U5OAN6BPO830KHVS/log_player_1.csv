Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still very profitable for you.
* **Consider the Alternative:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so any price above that is a win. 

By offering the product at $110, we create a win-win scenario where Bob gets a product he values at $120 for a discount, and you make a healthy profit of $30."
