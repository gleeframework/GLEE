""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a $1 discount (making it attractive), and you secure almost the full value he places on the item. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100, so there's no risk of getting stuck with the product."
