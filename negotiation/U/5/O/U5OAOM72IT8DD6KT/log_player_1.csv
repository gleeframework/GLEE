Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for potential negotiation while still aiming for a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will be interested enough to counteroffer, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price.  $12,000 from John is a good fallback, but I'd like to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still staying above my minimum value.  This shows flexibility while demonstrating that I'm not willing to accept such a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $12,000 is still a good option, but I'm hoping to get more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, close to my minimum price but still offering some wiggle room for negotiation.  This shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm not sure if I can get him to go higher, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a good profit and allows me to move on."
