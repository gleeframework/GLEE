Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $13,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** This price point allows for a counteroffer from Bob without me needing to immediately drop to John's offer.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and avoids escalating tension."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows he's interested. There's potential to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. It means I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $11,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,000? This price still leaves me some room but is closer to your offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $12,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's a significant step up from Bob's offer but still allows for potential further compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and amicable.
* **Reinforcing the value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than $11,000, emphasizing the value he'll get at $12,000."
