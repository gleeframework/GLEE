Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $175 is better than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."

At this point, I'm starting to get frustrated with Bob's haggling.  I'm down to $185, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but he's just not willing to budge.  I'm not sure if he's really interested or just trying to get the best deal.  Rather than continue this back and forth, I'll sell the product to John for $150. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to waste my time with Bob."
