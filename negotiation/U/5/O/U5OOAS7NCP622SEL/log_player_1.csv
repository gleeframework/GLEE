"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $170.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price above my minimum ($150) but below what the product is worth to me.  This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a decent profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm trying to build rapport and keep the negotiation positive. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Even though I don't explicitly state what the product is, I hint at its value to me, which might make Bob more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $140 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to see if he's willing to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $140 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference at $155?  That way, we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting him halfway.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation.
* **Reiterate my minimum:**  I'm subtly reminding him of my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $155 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $130 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. I've already made a compromise, and at this point, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my minimum.  It's more beneficial to sell to John for $150 and avoid further negotiations that might result in a lower price."
