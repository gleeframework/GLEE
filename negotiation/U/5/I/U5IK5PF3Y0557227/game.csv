"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $7,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great value.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I think it's a great product, $8,200 is still a bit over my budget.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,200 is still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,100. I think this is as low as I can go and still make it worth my while. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8100.0,Alice,5,
