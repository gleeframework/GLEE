"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.**
* **You have room to negotiate.**  Even if Alice rejects your first counteroffer, you can continue negotiating or switch to John if necessary. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially save more money.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My initial counteroffer is $12,500. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $14,000, but it's still above her minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm aiming to find a price that's fair to both of us, while still saving as much money as possible. 
* **Flexibility:** I'm prepared to negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer. If the deal falls through, I can still buy from John for $15,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within my budget.**  I am willing to pay up to $15,000, and her offer is $13,500.
* **It's a good compromise.**  While I would prefer a lower price, Alice has shown some flexibility by moving closer to my counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  If I reject this offer, I risk having to buy from John at a higher price. 

It's a good deal for me, so I will accept the offer."
