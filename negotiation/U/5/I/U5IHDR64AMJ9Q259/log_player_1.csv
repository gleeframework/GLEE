Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I want, but it's still higher than what I'd get from John.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise that's still more profitable for me than selling to John, but also shows a willingness to negotiate with Bob."
