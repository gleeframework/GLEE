"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I propose a price of $750000 for the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've given it careful consideration, and while I would like to agree to your proposal, I still feel that a more equitable price would be $800000.
