"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. There's still a chance to get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to miss that opportunity just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $1,100,000 is still not enough. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation is dragging on and I might be better off selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 still isn't workable for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This negotiation is going nowhere fast. Bob is unwilling to come up to my minimum acceptable price. With only 4 rounds left, the chances of him increasing his offer to a satisfactory amount are slim. John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and significantly better than anything Bob is offering. I'm going to stop wasting time with Bob and sell to John."
