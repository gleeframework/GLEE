Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially achieving a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000, and I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but staying above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while still attempting to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is close to John's offer of $10,000. Since I'm unsure if I can get a higher offer from Bob, it's best to accept his offer and secure the sale."
