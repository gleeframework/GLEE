"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, and it is still within Bob's budget. It is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob can still secure a better deal by continuing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 
This counteroffer is closer to Alice's last offer, but still below Bob's maximum.  It's a strategic move to see if Alice is willing to meet Bob halfway."
