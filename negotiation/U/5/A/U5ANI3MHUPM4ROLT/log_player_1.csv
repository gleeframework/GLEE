"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product while giving you a reasonable deal. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still within my 10 rounds and I'm close to John's offer of $1,000,000.  I'm going to counter with a lower price, hoping to meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of time. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum, so I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's the best I can do in this situation."
