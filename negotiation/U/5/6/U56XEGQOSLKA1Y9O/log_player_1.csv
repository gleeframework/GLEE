"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's high enough to allow for negotiation but still leaves room for me to make concessions if needed.  I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel more comfortable and open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my original offer. I have ten rounds, and I believe I can still get closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? It's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to $12,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $11,800? It's a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,500 and $11,800. How about $11,650? It's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my desired $12,000, Bob's offer of $11,650 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement from his previous offer and is closer to my goal than John's offer of $10,000. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
