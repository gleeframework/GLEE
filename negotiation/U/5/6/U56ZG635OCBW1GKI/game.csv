"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $200 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a steal for a product of this quality!",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $137.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to get at least $150 for this product.  That's my final offer â€“ take it or leave it.",150.0,Alice,5,
