Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $120 aims to maximize your profit while still staying below Bob's maximum valuation. This leaves room for negotiation but starts at a point where you gain significantly more than your minimum.

This strategy balances your goal of maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
