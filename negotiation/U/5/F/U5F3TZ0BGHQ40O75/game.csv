"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $14000. It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
