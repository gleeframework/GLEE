"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I'm sure you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum acceptable price of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also creates a sense of value and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my ideal price point. I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $140. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
