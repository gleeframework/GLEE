# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $11,500 is still above your target, so rejecting and making a counteroffer makes sense."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $10,500?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a fair price, it's a bit lower than I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I believe this is a price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to your target, you can still try to push for a lower price. Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you the chance to see if you can get closer to your $10,000 limit."
