"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. I think it's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price from John since you know he's willing to sell for $150. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or get the product for your target price from John."
