I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed $800,000 with John, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

This strategy is based on:

* **Maximizing profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price.
* **Risk assessment:**  John's offer guarantees me a minimum profit, so I can afford to be ambitious with Bob.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  A slightly higher price than John's offer leaves room for bargaining with Bob. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
