"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying within your budget.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive and enthusiastic tone encourages Alice to continue the negotiation. 
* **Not Too Low:** While we want to save money, offering something drastically lower (e.g., $5,000) could be insulting and make Alice less likely to engage in a back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can do $10,500, which is the lowest I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Offer:** Alice's counteroffer is still $500 more expensive than buying from John. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Alice stated this is ""the lowest she can go,"" there's still room to negotiate. She might be willing to come down slightly to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a great product, Alice, and I appreciate you coming down in price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $9,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating our ""absolute limit,"" we're signaling to Alice that this is a serious offer and we're unlikely to go higher. However, the tone remains respectful and solution-oriented.
* **Midpoint Compromise:** $9,000 represents a reasonable midpoint between our initial offer ($8,000) and Alice's current price ($10,500). 
* **Urgency and Decision:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" adds a bit of pressure and suggests that a quick agreement is in Alice's best interest."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to meeting your price, Bob! I can do $9,200, which is the next lowest price I can offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $9,200 is only $200 more than our target price and a good compromise. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Alice has compromised twice now. Pushing further could make her less willing to negotiate, and we might lose the opportunity to buy it below $10,000.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate has a cost in terms of time and effort. Accepting now secures the deal at a reasonable price."
