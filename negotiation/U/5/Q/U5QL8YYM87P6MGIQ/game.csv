"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my business needs. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows right now. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
