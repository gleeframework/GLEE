"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value you've described.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 might be a stretch for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's unique features and benefits.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to compromise further if necessary.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $825000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. I hope you can meet me at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
