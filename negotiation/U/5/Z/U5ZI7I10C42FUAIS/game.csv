"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10,500.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $11,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
