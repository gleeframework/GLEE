Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling to another buyer who's already offered me that amount.
