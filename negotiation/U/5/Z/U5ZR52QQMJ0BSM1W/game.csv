"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I'm still working to find a price that works for me.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to move a little further.  I'm offering $1,075,000.  This price is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal with a little more negotiation.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $1,087,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to offer $1,080,000.  This price is a good compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a final deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
