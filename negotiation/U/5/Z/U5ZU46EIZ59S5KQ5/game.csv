"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $110 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $125. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",125.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $122.50. It's the last offer I'm willing to make, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",122.5,Alice,7,
