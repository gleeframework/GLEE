Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome with Bob while having a safety net in place."
