"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm looking for $12,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is above my maximum valuation. I will reject it and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than my actual maximum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still get a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting low, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying but need her to move on price. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above both my maximum and John's price. I'll reject and try to nudge her closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can do.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm a serious buyer and ready to close the deal today if the price is right."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount this time ($1,000). This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I have a firm limit in mind.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm adding a bit of pressure by mentioning I'm ""ready to close the deal today."" This might encourage Alice to be more flexible. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming a little below my actual maximum ($10,000), leaving a small buffer in case Alice makes one final counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to my maximum price, which matches what John is offering. There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal. It's time to accept."
