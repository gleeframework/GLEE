"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. This reflects the product's value to me while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise that leaves some room for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $11,000. Considering the product's worth to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $12,250. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",12250.0,Alice,5,
