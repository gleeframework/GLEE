"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'd like to start the conversation at $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's value of $800,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.
