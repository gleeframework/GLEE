# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the product's value to you. While her offer is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than what she values the product at ($800,000).  Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or sticking with John's offer, which is closer to your maximum budget."
