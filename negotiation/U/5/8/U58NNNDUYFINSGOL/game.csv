"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is getting closer, but to be frank, I need to see the number a bit higher. Would you consider $1,375,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and then some.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can only go up to $1,325,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. Can you consider that?",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you've been great to work with, and I respect your approach to this negotiation. To be completely transparent, $1,350,000 is the lowest I can go. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your transparency, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, which is the same as my previous offer. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
