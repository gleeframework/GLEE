**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price range significantly below our minimum. It's unlikely he'll come up to a price point that's acceptable in the remaining rounds. We have a guaranteed offer from John at our desired price, making it the most logical decision to maximize profit and minimize further negotiation risk."
