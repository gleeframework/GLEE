"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. Bob might reject it, but it sets a baseline for the negotiation and demonstrates the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try and counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. This is a good middle ground to test Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have time and a backup offer. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to offer $850,000. This is a further compromise, but I still need to earn more than what Bob is offering. This price is still above his maximum value, but it's possible he may be willing to pay it if he's determined to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is tempting, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I've made significant concessions, and it's worth seeing if we can get closer to $800,000 before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm going to offer $825,000. This is closer to Bob's potential maximum value and shows I'm willing to be flexible.  We're getting close, and hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is finally within my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's close enough to my value and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to counteroffer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
