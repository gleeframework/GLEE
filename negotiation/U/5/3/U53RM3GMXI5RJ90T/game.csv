"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $1,025,000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still looking for a bit more room.  How about $1,000,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to make a good sale.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
