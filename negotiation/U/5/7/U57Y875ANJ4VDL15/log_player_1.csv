Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm leaving a significant gap between my offer and my minimum price, allowing for multiple rounds of counteroffers.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or making a counteroffer.
* If Bob doesn't counter within a reasonable time, I will likely move on to John and sell for my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your position, but I'm currently looking for a deal closer to my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to pay more than his initial valuation, suggesting further negotiation is possible.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  While I could sell to John for $15,000, I don't want to risk losing Bob altogether.  He's potentially a buyer who could bring a higher price with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired price point, potentially somewhere between $11,000 and $12,000. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground that balances getting a better price while still maintaining a chance of securing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,500. This still represents a great value for you, and it's a price I can work with. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by too much. This shows I'm flexible but still aiming for a profitable deal.
* **Emphasize the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, hoping to encourage acceptance.
* **Maintain negotiation momentum:** This counteroffer keeps the conversation going, hopefully leading to a successful transaction.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll finalize the sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation and decide if I want to counteroffer again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $11,500.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I would have to sell to John for my minimum price.
* **Time is a factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely John might find another option, leaving me with nothing.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale for $11,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering the potential risks of continuing to negotiate."
