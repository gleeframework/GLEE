Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price, leaving room to negotiate down.  
* **Anchoring:** By opening with a high number, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value, potentially making him more receptive to a lower (but still profitable) price later.
* **Alternative in Play:** You have John as a backup, which gives you leverage to walk away from a bad deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. He went straight to his maximum budget, indicating potential willingness to go higher. Rejecting now allows you to counter and explore if you can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  You're showing flexibility by lowering your price, encouraging Bob to reciprocate.
* **Middle Ground:**  Aiming for the midpoint between his offer and your previous ask suggests fairness and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Profit:** You're still significantly above your minimum price, aiming for a more profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,300,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield smaller increments, risking the deal entirely.  Bob is unlikely to go much higher.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting secures the sale and avoids the uncertainty of further back-and-forth."
