I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a decent starting point that gives me some room to negotiate, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction to this initial offer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to accept that.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering with $18,000. This is still above my minimum price and leaves room for further negotiation, but it also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to counter again, hoping to push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but only to a certain point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure how much further we can negotiate. It's becoming a waste of time, and I'm confident John will buy the product for $15,000.  I'm going to sell it to John."
