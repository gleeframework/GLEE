"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $160. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  It's always worth negotiating, especially since you have the option to buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $160 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to your budget, it's still above your comfortable limit.  Since you can buy from John for $100, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit out of my range. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
