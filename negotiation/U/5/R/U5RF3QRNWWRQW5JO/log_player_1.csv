Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than the $8,000 Bob values the product at, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  $9,500 is still above your $10,000 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a strong opening position:** This price signals that you're serious about selling the product, but you're not desperate to get rid of it.

By offering this price, you are setting the tone for a negotiation where you are in a strong position, but also open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price. It's also possible that Bob might be willing to go higher if he realizes that I'm not desperate to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by suggesting a middle ground.  
* **Staying above my minimum:** $9,000 is still above my $10,000 minimum, so I'm not losing money.
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair deal for both of us"", which can be persuasive. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but that I'm also firm on my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not at $10,000.  With each negotiation round, the process is taking more time and energy.  It's also possible that Bob will continue to make lower offers, and I might end up selling the product at a price significantly lower than my desired value. 

Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $10,000.  This guarantees that I achieve my minimum desired profit, and I don't have to continue the negotiation with Bob."
