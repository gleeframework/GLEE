"Alice, your product is interesting, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $750000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $850000 to see if we can reach a deal.  This is a significant product, and I believe it's worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
