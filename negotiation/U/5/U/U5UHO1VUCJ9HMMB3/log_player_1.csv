Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Strong Alternative:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 gives us a strong fallback position and leverage in the negotiation.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob, who clearly sees substantial value in the product."
