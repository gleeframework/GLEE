"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $160? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $145, which is closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $160 might still be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. How about we try $155? It's a compromise that still gives me a good profit, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",155.0,Alice,5,
