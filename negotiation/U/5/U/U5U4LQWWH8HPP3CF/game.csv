"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value is worth more than $900,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's bridge the gap and get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a good price, but I'm still not willing to give up too much value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,5,
