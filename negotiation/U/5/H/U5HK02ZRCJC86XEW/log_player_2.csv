"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $140.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $150.

Since Alice's offer is lower than what you're willing to pay (and lower than John's price), accepting Alice's offer is the best choice to save money."
