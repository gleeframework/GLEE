{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $140 is above Bob's value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:** It's closer to my minimum price of $150, but still leaves room for Bob to counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly message encourages Bob to engage and negotiate.

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while still leaving room for a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum of $150, it's still below my desired price.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I believe I can still get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Knowing John will buy for $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum of $150, but closer to Bob's value, increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message maintains a positive tone, making Bob feel like I'm working with him to find a solution.

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential earnings and maintaining a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $130, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $132 is still below my ideal price, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for further negotiations:**  While I'm accepting Bob's offer, I'm keeping in mind that I can always negotiate further with Bob if I'm not satisfied with the deal later.
* **Avoiding the risk:**  I'm choosing to accept this offer rather than risk having Bob walk away completely.

This decision balances my desire to maximize profits with the need to ensure a sale. While $132 is not my ideal price, it's a reasonable offer and minimizes the risk of losing the sale entirely."
