Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [Product description - highlight key features/benefits]. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  We're starting with a price above our minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's worth and its potential benefits to Bob, creating a sense of its value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message uses open-ended language to encourage Bob to engage in a discussion. 

This approach allows us to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His response will reveal his willingness to pay and potentially his perceived value of the product. 
* **Negotiate from a Strong Position:**  We've set a high starting point, giving us leverage in potential counteroffers. 
* **Maximize Profit:**  We're aiming for a price higher than our minimum while still being open to a reasonable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While we want to maximize profit, we also need to ensure we receive a fair value for our product. Accepting his offer would result in a considerable loss. 

Rejecting the offer allows us to counter with a price closer to our minimum, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to accept. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $16,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Interest:**  We start by acknowledging his interest to build rapport. 
* **Counter with a Middle Ground:** We propose a price that's a compromise, midway between our previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Frame it as a Fair Offer:** We emphasize that this is a ""fair"" solution for both parties.  
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  We end with an open-ended question to encourage further discussion and potentially reach an agreement. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:**  Demonstrating willingness to compromise increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  $16,500 is still above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Keep the Negotiation Going:**  By inviting Bob to respond, we keep the conversation active and increase the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $10000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While we want to maximize profit, we also need to ensure we receive a fair value for our product.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob may lead to further concessions, but it's likely we won't reach a price we're comfortable with.  

Selling to John at $15,000 guarantees we receive our minimum acceptable price, making it the most rational decision in this scenario."
