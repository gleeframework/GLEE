Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, the message emphasizes the product's value, which might make the offer more appealing.

**Why not higher?**  While you want to maximize profit, starting too high (e.g., $140) might make Bob immediately reject the offer without a counter-proposal.  

**Why not lower?** Offering the product at $100 or slightly above leaves no room for negotiation and might make you lose potential profit if Bob was willing to pay a bit more."
