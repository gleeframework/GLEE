"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $1,800,000, we establish a high anchor. Even though Bob's perceived value is lower, this anchor can influence his counteroffers to be higher than they might have been otherwise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for several rounds of negotiation where we can gradually decrease the price while still aiming for a final sale price significantly above $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way above what I'm able to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value and significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is always an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Not Drastic Reduction:**  We decrease our offer by $200,000, which shows flexibility but avoids appearing desperate.
* **Reinforcing Value:** We reiterate the product's value to counter Bob's anchoring to his lower price point.
* **Justification:** We frame the reduction as a gesture of goodwill and a desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer still keeps us well above our minimum price, allowing for further concessions in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a significant step from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but Still Below Minimum:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, which is a good sign. However, $1,100,000 is still significantly below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Negotiating Room Remains:** With 6 rounds left, there's still time to try and negotiate a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer Needed:** A carefully crafted counteroffer is needed to both acknowledge Bob's movement and guide him closer to your acceptable range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect your willingness to move on price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,450,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This offer is slightly closer to our side, but it creates an appearance of a significant concession and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Shifting Focus to Agreement:** The language emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, promoting a collaborative atmosphere rather than a contentious back-and-forth.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While we are coming down, the offer is still safely above our absolute minimum, leaving room for potential adjustments in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached your minimum acceptable price. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher amount in the remaining rounds, it's risky. Bob has consistently moved upwards, but there's no guarantee he'll go higher than $1,200,000. Accepting now secures the deal at your desired minimum."
