,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is way above what I'm able to pay. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value and my minimum acceptable price.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This is a significant step from my initial offer and represents a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect your willingness to move on price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,450,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This shows my commitment to this deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
