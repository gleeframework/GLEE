"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
