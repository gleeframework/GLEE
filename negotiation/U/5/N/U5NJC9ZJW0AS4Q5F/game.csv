"Bob, I'm confident this product would be a valuable asset to your company. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. This price reflects the product's high quality and potential for significant returns.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $950000. This price reflects a fair balance between our needs and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to my expectations,  $950000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1050000. This price still offers you significant value and allows for a successful partnership. I'm confident this is a fair compromise and I'm eager to move forward with this transaction.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
