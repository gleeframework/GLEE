"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this opportunity. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still allows me to recover my investment while providing you with a substantial advantage.  Let's continue the conversation.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
