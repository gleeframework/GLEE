Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's aim for a final offer that benefits both of us. I'm prepared to accept $1,170,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close this deal. I believe this is a fair compromise. Let's seal this agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,170,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,170,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and waiting any longer risks her accepting a deal from another buyer.  While you could try to push for a slightly better price, accepting the $1,170,000 secures the product at a price significantly lower than both her initial offer and John's price."
