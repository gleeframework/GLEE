"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing its value to you. Let's discuss it further. Are you interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is being a bit vague in her initial message, her offer of $14,000 is still less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000."
