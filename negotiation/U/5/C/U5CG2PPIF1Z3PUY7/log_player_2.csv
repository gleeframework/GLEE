"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset for you.  It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's maximum budget is $12,000, and he can get the product from John for that price. Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Since Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense for him to reject Alice's offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price or find another seller."
