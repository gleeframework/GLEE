"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not instantly rejected. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is more than Bob's initial assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to accept such a low price yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $9,500 to make this work.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility while still being firm about my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $9,250 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250.  How about $9,400? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm offering a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility while still staying close to my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9,400. I'm willing to go up to $9,300, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,300 is tempting and close to my minimum, I'm still not completely satisfied. It's better to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and try for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,350.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9350}
```

I'm trying to be as agreeable as possible while still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $9,350 is a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $9,325, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,325. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,325
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  $9,325 is very close to my minimum, and accepting it ensures I don't lose out on the sale."
