"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and it allows you to make a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to stay above $950,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and is closer to your desired price point. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000.  However, that's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers.  $937,500 is a fair price that considers both of our positions. Let's finalize this deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,
