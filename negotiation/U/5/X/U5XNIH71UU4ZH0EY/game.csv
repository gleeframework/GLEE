"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's significantly below the value I've placed on this product. Let's find a price that's fair for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  Let's keep the conversation going.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and provides us both with a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
