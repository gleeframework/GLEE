Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now.  While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to take the $125, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. We've only had four rounds, so there's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. I'm willing to come down to $128. That's just a couple of dollars more than your offer, and it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 128}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with $128. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $128, which would be $126.50. Would you be willing to accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $126.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm not sure how much wiggle room Bob has, but I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $127? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 127}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $126? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've had several rounds of negotiation, and while Bob is willing to come up in price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $150.  I'm not sure how much more room there is for negotiation, and I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum, it's in my best interest to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
