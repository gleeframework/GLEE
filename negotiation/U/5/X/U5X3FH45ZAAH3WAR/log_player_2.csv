{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Bob is getting close to his maximum budget. While he's still hoping to save some money, he's also aware that he has limited rounds left. He's already had 6 rounds of negotiations, and there are only 4 rounds left. It's a high risk to continue negotiating, as there's a chance that Alice won't budge further and he might end up with no deal.

Buying from John for $12,000 guarantees him the product at his maximum budget. It's a safe bet that minimizes his risk of not securing the product."
