{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum.  I'm confident that if Bob rejects this offer, his counteroffer will be closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I can still try to get more.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and I think it's a fair price that gives us both a bit of what we want."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

Bob's offer of $13,500 is only $500 less than my initial offer and is well above my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to accept his offer."
