Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's potential for him to counteroffer and for you to reach a price that benefits both parties. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher price could scare Bob away, so this offer allows for a more natural back-and-forth.

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and the value Bob places on the product. There's room for you to push for a better price.

By rejecting his offer, you maintain the leverage to potentially secure a price closer to your desired $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Meeting Halfway:** $9,000 is halfway between your initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500.  This could appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While it's a lower price than your initial offer, it's still above your minimum, allowing you to potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Value:** $8,750 is close to the value you place on the product ($8,000) and is a fair price considering the negotiation process.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob, or he might walk away. 
* **Limited Upside:** There's not much room for further negotiation to significantly increase the price.  

While it's not your ideal price, accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for less."
