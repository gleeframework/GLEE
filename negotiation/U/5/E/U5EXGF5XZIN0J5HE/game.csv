"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, reflecting a significant discount from my original offer.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 still falls short of my minimum.  I'm prepared to go a little further and offer the product for $1,125,000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows both of us to achieve our goals. Let's close this deal!",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and reasonable price for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
