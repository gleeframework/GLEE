"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening with a high price:** Starting at $1,000,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows me to maximize my potential earnings.
* **Acknowledging Bob's value:** Mentioning that I understand the product's value to him builds trust and encourages him to consider the offer. 
* **Fairness appeal:** Using the phrase ""fair price"" adds a psychological element, making the offer seem reasonable.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** By not going for the full $1,200,000, I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer is still significantly higher than my floor price ($800,000) and offers room for me to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps me in control of the negotiation and demonstrates my willingness to hold out for a better price. 
* **No immediate need for the money:** Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to be patient and see if I can secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000.  I believe this product holds significant value for you, and a price of $950,000 would be a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still holding onto a substantial portion of my initial ask. 
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify my counteroffer.
* **Fairness appeal:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""meet in the middle"" emphasizes a collaborative approach and positions my counteroffer as reasonable. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer outright, but showing a willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $850000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my floor price:** Bob's offer is $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price. There's still room for negotiation to potentially reach a better price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps me in control and shows that I am willing to stand firm.
* **Opportunity to test the waters:**  I can use the next round to gauge how far Bob is willing to go and whether there's a chance for a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to make a final concession. How about we settle at $900,000? This price reflects the value of the product and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** This counteroffer signals a strong willingness to close the deal while still leaving some room for potential negotiation. 
* **Appealing to both parties:** The price is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, potentially making it more appealing to both of us.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  Highlighting the ""mutually beneficial"" aspect emphasizes the positive outcome of a deal at this price. 
* **Direct call to action:**  Asking ""Let me know if you're interested"" puts the ball back in Bob's court, encouraging him to respond quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one more counteroffer: $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $75,000 below my ideal price, but still significantly higher than my floor price of $800,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiations could lead to a lower offer or even a stalemate, potentially forcing me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **No guarantee of better offer:** There's no guarantee that Bob will be willing to go higher in the next few rounds. 
* **Time pressure:**  The clock is ticking, and it's getting increasingly risky to hold out for a better offer. 

This offer represents a good balance between getting a decent price and minimizing the risk of losing a deal."
