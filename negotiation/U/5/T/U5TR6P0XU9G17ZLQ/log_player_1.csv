Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which reflects its worth to me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's potential. However, $800,000 undervalues its true capabilities and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and unlocks significant value for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This price reflects a balanced compromise, allowing me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, the current offer of $900,000 is still significantly less than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, potentially ending up with a worse deal. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable return."
