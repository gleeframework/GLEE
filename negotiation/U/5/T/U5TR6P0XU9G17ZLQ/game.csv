"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which reflects its worth to me. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's potential. However, $800,000 undervalues its true capabilities and the returns you'll see. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and unlocks significant value for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 remains outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. This price reflects a balanced compromise, allowing me to acquire the product while acknowledging its value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
