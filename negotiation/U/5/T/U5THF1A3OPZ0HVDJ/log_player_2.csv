"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I will end up paying $1,150,000, which is more than I'm willing to pay. Buying from John will cost me $1,200,000, which is more than Alice's offer, but I'd rather not overpay. So, I will reject Alice's offer and see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
