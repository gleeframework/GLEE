Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This reflects its value to me, and it's the maximum I can afford at the moment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. I'll counteroffer at $1350000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1275000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $1312500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity, and it's a bit closer to your offer. What do you think?",1312500.0,Alice,5,
