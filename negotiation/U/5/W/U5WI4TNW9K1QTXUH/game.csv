"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference at $15,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",15000.0,Bob,4,
