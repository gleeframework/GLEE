{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly lower than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and framing the offer as a discount to make it more appealing.

**Reasoning:**

I want to start with a price that is tempting for Bob while still leaving myself room to negotiate. This allows for a possible deal while also ensuring that I'm not immediately conceding to a price significantly below my minimum value.  I'm hoping to push Bob towards accepting a price closer to my minimum, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay up to $800000.  This is my best offer. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, it's important to remember that I have a backup option with John. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at such a low price, especially since I can get a much better price from John.

**Reasoning:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and get a better deal from him. I'll likely counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, potentially making a compromise. If Bob doesn't meet me halfway, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800,000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $1,000,000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility while still staying significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and framing my counteroffer as a compromise. I'm also highlighting the value the product offers to reinforce my position.

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to bridge the gap between our desired prices. $1,000,000 represents a middle ground. I believe it's still a profitable deal for me, and it might be enticing enough for Bob to reconsider his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm on his offer of $800,000, which is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product for so much less than its value to me. 

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
