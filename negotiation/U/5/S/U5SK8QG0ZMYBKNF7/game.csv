"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount, but I'm hoping we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay up to $800000.  This is my best offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $800000 is below what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to drop the price to $1000000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,4,
