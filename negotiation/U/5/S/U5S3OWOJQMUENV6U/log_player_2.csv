"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option at $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice for a better price."
