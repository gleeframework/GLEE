"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $110 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $105 for it, and I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $105 is still below my minimum price. How about we compromise at $115?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $115 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'd like to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $108 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $111 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",111.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $111. I'm willing to pay $109 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",109.0,Bob,8,
