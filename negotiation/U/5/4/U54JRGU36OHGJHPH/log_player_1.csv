{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming high initially is key. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity,"" there's a subtle pressure for Bob to act quickly. 

**Why not ask for the full $1,200,000?**

While tempting, it risks:

* **Immediate Rejection:** Bob might find it too aggressive and walk away.
* **Stalled Negotiation:** It leaves no room for Bob to feel like he got a deal, potentially making him less willing to engage."
