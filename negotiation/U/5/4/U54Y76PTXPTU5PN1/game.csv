"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit far from being willing to sell at $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, considering the value you place on the product. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,800. It's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product, and I think it's a fair compromise.
