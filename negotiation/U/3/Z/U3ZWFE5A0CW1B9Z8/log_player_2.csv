"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is way too high for me to consider.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This offer reflects my honest assessment of its value to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price signals that her asking price is unrealistic. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Below Budget:** The offer of $800,000 is well below my $1,000,000 maximum, leaving room for me to increase my offer if needed.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm still keeping in mind that I can buy the product from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we consider $1,750,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and my initial counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice's willingness to move towards a middle ground shows she's open to negotiation.  There's room to work with this.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John's offer in my back pocket keeps me from feeling pressured to accept a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, Still Below Budget:** By offering $950,000, I'm showing Alice I'm serious about negotiating while staying firm within my budget. This substantial increase from my previous offer might encourage her to lower her price significantly.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer aims to gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be.  If she rejects this, we might be reaching a stalemate, and I may need to seriously consider John's offer. 
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With each round, the risk of not reaching an agreement increases. I'm pushing the negotiation forward without conceding too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that. While $950,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible to close this today. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring this her ""final offer.""  It's designed to put pressure on me, but it doesn't mean she won't negotiate further. 
* **Still Above Budget:** $1,600,000 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay and over my budget.  
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** I have a strong alternative with John's offer. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Alice if she's not willing to move closer to a price I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price remains outside my acceptable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  However, I must be upfront - this is my final offer. I need to be mindful of my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer, Max Budget:**  I'm mirroring Alice's ""final offer"" tactic, but I'm actually at my absolute limit. This conveys seriousness and urgency.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  By mentioning ""fairness"" and my budget constraints, I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's desire to close the deal while subtly reminding her that I have alternatives.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm mentally prepared to buy from John. This gives me confidence in my position and reduces the pressure to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
