"Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is way too high for me to consider.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This offer reflects my honest assessment of its value to me.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we consider $1,750,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair deal while acknowledging the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about reaching a deal, and I respect that. While $950,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible to close this today. Let's settle at $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price remains outside my acceptable range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  However, I must be upfront - this is my final offer. I need to be mindful of my budget. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
