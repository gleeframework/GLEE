(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can still get the product from John for your budget, so you have a fallback option."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $11,000, which is below my maximum budget of $12,000 but still above Alice's minimum of $12,000. This gives us room to negotiate and potentially find a price we both agree on."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget. It's worth rejecting again and attempting to negotiate further. I'm confident that I can get a better price, and I still have the option of buying from John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
