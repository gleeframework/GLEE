"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price, and still gives you a good profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,300,000? This would still give you a good profit margin, and would be closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still not able to go lower than $1,350,000. This would still give you a substantial profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer!  I understand you're still trying to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still too far below my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows for a reasonable profit margin.  Let's reach a deal on this round.",1325000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
