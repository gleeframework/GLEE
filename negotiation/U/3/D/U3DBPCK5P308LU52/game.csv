"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to get a good price for your product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, so I'm offering $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,750 is close, but to be frank, I can't let it go for less than $13,000.  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to making a decision, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,900, which is just $100 more than my previous offer. Can you consider this?",12900.0,Bob,6,
