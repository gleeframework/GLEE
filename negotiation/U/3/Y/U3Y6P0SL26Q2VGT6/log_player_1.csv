"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $120."", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm mentioning the product's value to Bob, hoping to get him thinking about how much he'd be willing to pay. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for Bob to counteroffer and potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still below what I'd like to get. I believe there's room for negotiation, especially since the product is worth significantly more to him. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if I can close the gap and get a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** While selling to John guarantees a safe $80, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $105? This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $120 to $105, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to nudge him towards a higher price.
* **Midpoint Approach:** $105 is closer to my desired price ($120) than Bob's offer ($90), but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still thinking that $90 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go up to $95, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still not ideal. It's a bit too close to my minimum value for the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room for me to make a counteroffer and try to secure a higher price. I believe I can push for a price closer to $100.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $80, I'm still confident I can get a better deal with Bob. The potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk of losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $95 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair compromise and a great price for the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is my final compromise. It's a significant step down from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum and closer to the middle ground.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value Bob will receive, aiming to encourage him to reconsider.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm confident that $100 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping this offer will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, so how about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $97.50 is very close to my desired price of $100. While I'd prefer to get $100, the difference of $2.50 is not significant enough to risk losing the deal.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer now guarantees a sale and income, and it's better than waiting for another round and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John at a lower price.

Given the circumstances, accepting this offer is the most logical choice to maximize my profit within the given constraints."
