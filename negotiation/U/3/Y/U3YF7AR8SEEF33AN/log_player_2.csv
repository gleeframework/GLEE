"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer at his maximum budget. This sets a clear limit and forces Alice to consider a substantial price reduction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price. There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should continue to push for a lower price. Offering $12,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's previous offer and shows Bob is serious about negotiating.  It's a good balance between pushing for a better deal and not being too aggressive that Alice might walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfort zone.  There's room for further negotiation, and Bob should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should continue to push for a lower price.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and this offer is a reasonable compromise. It's a good middle ground between Bob's desired price and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his comfort zone.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and hasn't been able to get Alice to drop below his $10,000 limit. John offers a guaranteed price that meets Bob's budget, making it the most logical choice at this point."
