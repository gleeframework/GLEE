"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11500.

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10800. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $11200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",11200.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10900.0,Bob,8,
