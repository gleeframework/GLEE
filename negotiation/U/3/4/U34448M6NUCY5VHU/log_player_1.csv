Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 as a starting point.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to a million, his increases are incremental.  At this stage, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that significantly outperforms John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the $1,000,000 from John."
