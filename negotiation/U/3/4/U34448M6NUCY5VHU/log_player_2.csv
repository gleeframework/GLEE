{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 as a starting point.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,800,000 represents the product's true value, I understand your perspective.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not going to pay more than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still outside my range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 significantly undervalues the product. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a much higher price.  However, I value our conversation and am willing to make a final offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm going to try to push for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  To be fair, I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price is within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
