,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1300000 is still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to consider a price of $1350000. This would allow for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1250000. Is this something you'd consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still significantly lower than what I believe is fair for this product. To compromise, I'm offering a final price of $1300000. This is a very reasonable price considering the product's true value. I hope you'll reconsider.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1300000, so I'm offering $1220000. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",1220000.0,Bob,6,
