"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that I'm already dropping below my minimum asking price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is a significant drop from my initial asking price and a good compromise.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.  Let's close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
