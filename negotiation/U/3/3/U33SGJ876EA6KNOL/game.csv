"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I would like to stick to my previous proposal. I am offering $950000 for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider $1025000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $975000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's my final offer. If you're interested, we can finalize the deal at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm still willing to work with you. However, $990000 is still a bit too low. I'm going to make one final offer: $1075000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for a much higher price.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
