Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a reasonable range. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also want a fair price.  It leaves room for negotiation and hopefully starts a conversation that leads to a mutually agreeable price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although it's lower than her initial offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can reach a better price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to counteroffer again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still below her asking price and within my budget.  This move continues to build momentum towards a deal while maintaining a strong negotiating position."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at the upper limit of my budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach a deal within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure the product at a guaranteed price from John, ensuring I get the product within my budget."
