"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth $8,000 to Alice, so you have room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer will allow you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $9,000. 
* It's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000, giving her some room to negotiate.
* This price is still significantly better than buying from John for $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $9,200 is still higher than your initial counteroffer of $8,500. You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated that she's open to lowering the price.  Rejecting her offer again gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer that's closer to your ideal price while still leaving room for negotiation.  Remember, you can always buy from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer of $8,500, showing that you are willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.
* It is still below Alice's latest offer of $9,200, indicating that you are serious about negotiating. 
* This price is still significantly better than buying from John for $10,000. 
* This counteroffer leaves room for Alice to negotiate a bit further, as she's aiming for $8,000, without making it seem like you're lowballing her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is getting closer to your limit, but it's still higher than your ideal price. At this point, the negotiation is becoming time-consuming, and the potential for a further price drop is uncertain. Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, it's a safer and more efficient option to avoid further negotiation and simply buy from John."
