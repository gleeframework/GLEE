"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'm getting a good value, and you're still selling it for more than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. It's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting a great value for your money.
