"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $18,000 is far above his maximum budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if she's willing to come down closer to his price point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $16,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $16,000 is less than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, which is significantly cheaper.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if she's willing to come down closer to his price point or accept the deal with John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'm getting a good value, and you're still selling it for more than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. It's still a good deal for you, as you'll be getting a great value for your money. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above Bob's budget, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price of $10,000. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as she's already made her final offer."
