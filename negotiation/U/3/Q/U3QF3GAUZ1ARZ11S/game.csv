"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $12,000 falls significantly short of that.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
