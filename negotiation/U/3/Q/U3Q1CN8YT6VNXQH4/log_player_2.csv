"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price, and he knows that Alice is motivated to sell. By offering $11,000, he's showing his willingness to negotiate while also setting a price that's within his budget. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to compromise, potentially leading to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit of $12,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and secure a better price. There's still room for Alice to compromise, especially considering that she is motivated to sell the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it aligns with my budget. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing his final offer, matching his maximum budget of $12,000.  This demonstrates his commitment to a deal while leaving no room for further negotiation. Alice now has a clear choice â€“ accept and sell at Bob's desired price or risk losing the sale."
