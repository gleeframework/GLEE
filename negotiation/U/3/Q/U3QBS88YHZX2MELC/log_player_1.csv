"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest. $1,500,000 is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  This strategy allows me to potentially secure a higher price while also having the option to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. While I could accept and sell the product for $900,000,  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a viable option, but I'm not ready to walk away yet. I'll counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. This is still above my minimum value and a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's low offer.  This move shows flexibility while maintaining my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum value. There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in future rounds, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer secures a good price and eliminates the risk of ending up with nothing. Selling to John for the same price provides no additional benefit, so accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
