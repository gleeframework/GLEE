Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  You want to start with a counteroffer that's close enough to Alice's offer to show you're serious but still leaves room for further negotiation.
