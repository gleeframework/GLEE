"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something that's truly valuable to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to stretch your budget to get the product, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $11,000, and we can call it a day?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make sure you get a fair price. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $10,850.  This is a good compromise that shows we're both willing to meet in the middle.  What do you think?",10850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you at $10,850, but I'd like to propose a small premium for the convenience and exclusivity of this deal. How about we meet at $11,050? This way, we can both feel good about the transaction.",11050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not sure I understand the added premium. I've already shown my commitment to getting this product, and I believe $10,950 is a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's finalize this deal at this point.",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting close to your budget limit, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we meet at $11,025? This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.",11025.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. We're almost there.  I'm willing to go up to $10,975. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our interests.  Let's close this deal now. ",10975.0,Bob,10,
