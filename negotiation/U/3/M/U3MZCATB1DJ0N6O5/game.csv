"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This price is still significantly more than your value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings to the table is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This price would be a good deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
