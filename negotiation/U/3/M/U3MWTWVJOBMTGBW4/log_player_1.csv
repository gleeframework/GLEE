Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly higher allows you to potentially earn more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is still a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $120. It leaves room for negotiation while being enticing enough for him to consider.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob towards a quicker decision. 

By starting at $140, you give yourself some negotiating room if Bob tries to haggle, while still ensuring a profit above your minimum."
