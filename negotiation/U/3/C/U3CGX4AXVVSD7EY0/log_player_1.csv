{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $700,000 if he buys it for $800,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000, which you can get from John.
* **Targeting a High Profit:** By offering the product at $1,200,000, you aim to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential profit of $300,000. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  If Bob is very risk-averse, he might try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  This offer starts the negotiation. Be prepared to potentially lower the price slightly to secure the deal with Bob."
