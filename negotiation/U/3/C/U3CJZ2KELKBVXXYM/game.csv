"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for this product.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, just like I offered in round 4. Can you meet me at that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made three concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $127.50. That's the best I can do. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options.",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're frustrated, but I'm not willing to pay $127.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $127.50, which is $126.25. Can you consider that price?",126.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Bob. I've already made a lot of concessions, and I'm not willing to give in anymore. I'm willing to meet you at $126.50. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else.",126.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to pay $126.50. I've already offered $125, and I think that's a fair price. I'm not going to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if you're not willing to meet me at $125.",125.0,Bob,10,
