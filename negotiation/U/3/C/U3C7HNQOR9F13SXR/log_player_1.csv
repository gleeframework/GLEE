Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is still a decent amount, it's significantly lower than what I consider fair.  I'll try to counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.
