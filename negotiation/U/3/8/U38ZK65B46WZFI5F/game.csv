"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to make a serious commitment. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
