Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm not willing to accept Bob's low offer of $600,000.  I believe the product is worth more, and I'm going to counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value and potential.  To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This offer still allows for a substantial profit for you, while acknowledging the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a big leap for me. To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $700,000.  If you're willing to work within that range, I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, $700,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your budget constraints. However, $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This price point is still fair considering the potential benefits for you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
