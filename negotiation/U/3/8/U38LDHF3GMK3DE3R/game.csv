"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 is significantly below the product's true value and potential.  To show my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This offer still allows for a substantial profit for you, while acknowledging the product's value. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a big leap for me. To be frank, my budget for this is closer to $700,000.  If you're willing to work within that range, I'm confident we can make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your budget constraints. However, $700,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product for your business.  To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This price point is still fair considering the potential benefits for you, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a good compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this.",900000.0,Alice,5,
