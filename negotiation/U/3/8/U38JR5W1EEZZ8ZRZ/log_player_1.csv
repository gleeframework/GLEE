Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000.  This is significantly more than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested. If he rejects, I can gauge his seriousness and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While it's tempting to take the $800,000, I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'll start by trying to meet him halfway, but I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,200,000, which is halfway between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I hope this encourages Bob to come up with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low, but he's getting closer.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to close the gap with my counteroffer.  I need to make sure I'm getting as close as possible to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm going to offer $1,100,000. This is a smaller step down from my previous counteroffer, showing I'm serious about finding a compromise, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to make a move towards my desired price."
