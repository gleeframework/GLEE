Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal.  However, I am aware that Bob might reject this offer. If he does, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum of $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects my offer, I will keep John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise.  While John is a solid backup option, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to be more realistic, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation with Bob and potentially losing out on a deal with John. John is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
