Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe is worth at least $1,000,000 to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification of Value:** Highlighting that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to Bob attempts to anchor his perception of its value.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is a bold opening strategy. Bob might outright reject the offer. However, it gives you the best chance to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate down from a strong position. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
