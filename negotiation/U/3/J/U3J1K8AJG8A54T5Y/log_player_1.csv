Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,400,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so there's a margin for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 

By starting with this offer, you're showing that you're serious about getting a good price, but also leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm raising the price slightly to $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to accept significantly less than my initial offer.  This should hopefully lead to a faster and more favorable agreement."
