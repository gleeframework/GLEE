"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best price possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a good starting point. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still a reasonable price considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what he would pay John and still leaves Alice with a profit. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and the possibility of losing the product to another buyer (or John) outweighs the potential savings."
