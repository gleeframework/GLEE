"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. In light of that, I'd like to extend a counteroffer of $9000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our previous offers and I believe it provides a fair value for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a little higher than my budget allows. I'm really determined to purchase this product, and I'm prepared to pay $8750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
