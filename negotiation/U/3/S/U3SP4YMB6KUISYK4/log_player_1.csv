Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above my minimum:** I won't sell for less than $1,500,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's ambitious:**  I'm aiming for the highest possible price, knowing I can always lower it if necessary. 

By starting high, I put the pressure on Bob to justify why he would pay less.  If he counteroffers, I can then adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum.  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also maintaining a strong position.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer but still comfortably above my minimum price. I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, hoping he'll see the value in my product and come closer to my price.  If he rejects this offer again, I'll be more inclined to consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much further. It's time to move on and accept John's offer, which is at least my minimum acceptable price."
