"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  $1,400,000 is still a significant amount, and there's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,320,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,320,000 is better than her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should counteroffer again to try and get the price closer to his desired range."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,275,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my original asking price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise and saves him $200,000 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it's risky considering Alice is already at her lowest price and Bob could lose the deal altogether."
