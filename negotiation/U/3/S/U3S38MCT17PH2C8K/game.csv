"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given my own valuation, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a significant step up from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
