"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,100,000. This is a significant amount less than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. I'm confident that I can secure a price closer to my desired value of $800,000 within the ten rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my desired value. I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation. I will counteroffer in the next round to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm adjusting my offer down to $1,050,000. This is a significant step closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to compromise.  

My goal is to find a middle ground while still securing a price significantly above my minimum of $800,000.  I believe this counteroffer will keep Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my desired value.  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price, but I'm running out of rounds. Accepting this offer will give me a substantial profit, and the risk of continuing the negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a loss of the deal entirely.  It's a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
