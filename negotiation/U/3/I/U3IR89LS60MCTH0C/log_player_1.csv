"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's estimated value. This allows room for negotiation while still getting a decent price.  I'm confident Bob will be willing to negotiate, as he values the product higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is above my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than my initial goal, it's a reasonable price, and it's better than selling to John for $120.  I'm also nearing the end of the rounds, and it's likely Bob won't budge further."
