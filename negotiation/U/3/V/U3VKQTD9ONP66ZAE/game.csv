"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  This still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know if you're interested.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your seriousness. I'm willing to go down to $155, but that's my absolute bottom line. It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures I can cover my costs. Let me know if that works for you.",155.0,Alice,5,
