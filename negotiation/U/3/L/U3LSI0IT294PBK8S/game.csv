"Alice,  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value this product brings to your business.",10500.0,Alice,5,
