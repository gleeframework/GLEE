"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,400,000. Since Alice values the product at $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer of $1,400,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price. Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John, so there's still some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject a lower counteroffer and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
