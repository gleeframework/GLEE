"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. Let me know if you're interested!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $925,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
