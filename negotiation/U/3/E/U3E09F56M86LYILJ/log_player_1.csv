"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $7,750 is still below my acceptable price of $8,000. I'll try to push for a higher offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still too low.  Let's aim for something closer to $8,250. That's a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you, and it's also closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
