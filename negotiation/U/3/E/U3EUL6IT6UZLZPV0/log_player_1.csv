"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and start the bargaining process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can negotiate a better price. How about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $9,750,  considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to reject and try to get a little closer to my target. I've already rejected him once at this price, so I think I can get a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still a little higher than that. How about we split the difference and settle for $9,625?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $9,550. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but we've already gone through 6 rounds and haven't gotten to my desired price point yet.  It's starting to feel like it's going to be a long negotiation to get to my ideal price. John's offer of $12,000 is a sure thing and is much closer to my minimum.  I'm going to take the safer option and sell to John."
