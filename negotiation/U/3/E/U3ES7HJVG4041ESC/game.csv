"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $155. This still allows me a reasonable profit while giving you a fair price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $155 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $150? This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option for the same product.",150.0,Bob,4,
