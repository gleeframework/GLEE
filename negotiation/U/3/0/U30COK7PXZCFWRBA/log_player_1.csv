"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** We start with a strong opening offer that is significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and our minimum. This provides room for negotiation while signaling the product's value.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  The high price allows us to gauge Bob's interest level and understand how eager he is to purchase. His response will provide valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), so we can afford to be assertive in the early rounds.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and its potential benefits, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his own valuation of $1,000,000, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a significant gap between his offer and our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000). We have room to negotiate and try to close that gap. 
* **Alternative Safety Net:**  We can still fall back on John's offer if needed, allowing us to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my valuation for this product. To move things forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000. This represents a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (But Not Too Much):** We lowered our price by $150,000, demonstrating a willingness to make a deal, but not drastically dropping our price. 
* **Midpoint Psychology:** This counteroffer sits roughly between our initial asking price and Bob's offer, potentially making it feel more reasonable.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message continues to emphasize the product's value, justifying the price point.
* **Time Pressure:** As we progress through the rounds, introducing a mild sense of time pressure can be beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Strong Profit:** Accepting this offer gives us a $50,000 profit over our secured alternative with John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead Bob to lower his offer, especially since we're already in Round 4. It's best to secure a favorable deal now rather than risk losing the profit."
