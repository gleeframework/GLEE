"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and its potential benefits, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my valuation for this product. To move things forward, I'd be willing to accept $1,450,000. This represents a substantial reduction on my part and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is closer to my budget and a good compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
