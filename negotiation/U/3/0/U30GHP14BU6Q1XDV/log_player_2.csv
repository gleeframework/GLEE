"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,080,000 is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000.  While there might be room for further negotiation, accepting this offer secures the product and saves Bob $30,000."
