``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,100,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. I also leave the door open for further negotiation, suggesting a win-win outcome.

This strategy aims to:

* **Establish a baseline:**  This gives Bob a clear understanding of my initial expectation.
* **Set the tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation collaborative and positive.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a mutually agreeable price."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's tempting to take the quick sale, I'm willing to risk further negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** This shows him that I am serious about my value and won't settle for a drastically low price.
* **Moving to the next round:**  I want to see if I can increase Bob's offer by making a counteroffer and continuing the negotiation process.

I believe I have enough rounds left to potentially get a better price, and I'm confident I can find a solution that benefits both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come closer to my price, but $980,000 is still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,020,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are at the end of our negotiations with Bob. Although he has increased his offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

* **Sell to John:**  With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a satisfactory price with Bob. To ensure I get the minimum return I need, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,200,000. This decision is based on the following factors:

    * **Time constraint:**  The negotiation with Bob has reached a stalemate, and it's unlikely he will increase his offer enough to meet my minimum price. 
    * **Guaranteed value:** John's offer provides me with a guaranteed return that meets my minimum requirement.
    * **Risk mitigation:** While I'm hoping to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether.

I believe that selling to John at this point is the most sensible choice, given the limited time and the potential for a less favorable outcome with Bob."
