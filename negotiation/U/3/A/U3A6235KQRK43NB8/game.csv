"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $7,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $6,750?  That would make it much easier for me to say yes.",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $7,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",7200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $6,900.  Let me know if that works for you.",6900.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $7,500, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,7,
