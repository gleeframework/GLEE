"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still worth exploring further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John at this point would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to sell. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1400000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below the value of the product for him.  I'm going to continue negotiating.  John offers a safe $1,500,000, but I think I can push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,500,000, but this is my final offer.  I believe this price is still fair given the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1300000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are getting increasingly lower.  While I could counter again, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  It's time to secure the sale."
