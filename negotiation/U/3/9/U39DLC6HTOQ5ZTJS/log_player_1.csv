Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you considering your value for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I would prefer to get a better price, I need to see if I can negotiate a better deal before I sell to John."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $950000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for.  I need to see if I can push for a higher price before I settle."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1050000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering you value it at $1500000 and I'm already willing to pay over my initial goal. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $980,000 is still significantly below what I'm hoping for.  Selling to John ensures I get the maximum value for the product, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future."
