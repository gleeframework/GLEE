"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to do $100 for it? That's the absolute maximum I can pay.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. It's a great deal for a product like this, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's make a deal!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",110.0,Bob,4,
