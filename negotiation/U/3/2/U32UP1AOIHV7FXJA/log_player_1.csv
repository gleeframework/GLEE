"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting high, at $15,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's still good for me, while also gauging Bob's interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm hoping for more. I'm going to reject and see if I can get him to come up a bit in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is $500 above my minimum and we are already in round 4. I don't want to risk losing too much time and having to deal with more counteroffers.  I'm going to accept his offer."
