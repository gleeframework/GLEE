I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While $115 is better than nothing, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $118. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob seems determined to stay at $115, which is below my minimum. I'm not willing to go any lower. John is a guaranteed sale at $120, so I'll take that option."
