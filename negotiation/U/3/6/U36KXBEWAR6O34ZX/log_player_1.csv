{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but still allows for some negotiation room.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to settle for that low of an offer.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $900,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant discount for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000, so I'm going to counteroffer once more.  If Bob doesn't meet me halfway, I'll sell to John."
