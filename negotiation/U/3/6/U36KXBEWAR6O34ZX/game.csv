"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant discount for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $950000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a very fair offer, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
