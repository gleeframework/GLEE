"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000.  It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $900000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant discount for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. While it's a better price than her initial offer, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer will allow you to try to push her further towards your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a very fair offer, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While it is closer than previous offers, it is still a risk to continue negotiating. You have a reliable alternative with John who is willing to sell the product for your budget.  Buying from John eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Alice and guarantees you the product at your desired price."
