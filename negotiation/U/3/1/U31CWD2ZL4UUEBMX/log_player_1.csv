Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* I'm not starting at my absolute minimum price of $1,500,000 because I want to see if there's any wiggle room with Bob before potentially selling to John.
* This strategy aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and potential negotiation range.
    * Maximize potential profit while keeping the option of selling to John if negotiations fail."

* By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.
* I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open if this counteroffer is also rejected."

**Explanation:**

* While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I would ideally like to get. 
* I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of Bob before resorting to selling to John.
* I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely lead to further price reductions, potentially below my minimum.
* Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and a significant profit.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell the product to John at this point."
