Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $12,000 for the product.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **Starting point:** Offering $11,000 allows for some room for negotiation while still being above my minimum. 
* **Strategic message:** The message highlights the value to Bob while also suggesting that this is a fair price.

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for counter-offer:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is not realistic. I can likely get a better price with a counter-offer.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum gives me confidence to continue negotiating with Bob without being desperate. 

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? This price is still within your stated value for the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on value:** The message reiterates that the offer is within Bob's stated value for the product, making it seem more appealing.
* **Fair profit:** The message subtly emphasizes my need for a ""fair profit"", justifying my refusal of Bob's low offer. 

This counter-offer aims to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties while still remaining profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not close enough:** $10,200 is closer to my minimum, but still below it.  I'm not desperate to sell and can likely get a better price.
* **John is my safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $12,000 gives me the leverage to keep negotiating with Bob.
* **Potential for a slight increase:** There's still room for Bob to increase his offer a bit, especially since he's already shown a willingness to compromise.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, and I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,200.  I'm going to be upfront: $10,200 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Would you be willing to go up just a little more, to $10,800? This would allow me to make a fair profit, and it's still well within your stated value for the product. Let's try to close this deal - I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **A small but significant increase:**  I'm only asking for a $600 increase from Bob's last offer.  This seems small enough that he might be willing to budge.
* **Reinforcing value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this price is still within his stated value for the product.
* **Positive and forward-looking:**  The message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us, fostering a sense of collaboration.

This counter-offer aims to secure a deal that is both profitable for me and within Bob's budget, moving the negotiations closer to a successful conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $10,200. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is firm at $10,200, and I'm not willing to go below $10,800. We've reached an impasse.
* **John is the better option:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation. 
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag on and potentially lead to a lower price or a lost deal entirely.

It's time to cut my losses and accept John's offer.  It's a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
