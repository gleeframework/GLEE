``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, making it attractive to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I'll be prepared to counter if Bob rejects my initial offer.  I'll also be watching the clock â€“ if the negotiation drags on too long, I'll be happy to accept John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $1,000,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $900000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,200,000. It's the best option to maximize my profit."
