This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Strong Return:**  $1,125,000 is a significant profit above your minimum selling price.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further negotiation or Bob walking away.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
* **Relationship Building:** While a slightly higher price might be attainable, accepting shows Bob you're willing to compromise for a mutually beneficial outcome. This can be valuable in future dealings."
