"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This offer is fair and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my desired price and is a good compromise. It's time to close the deal and secure this profitable outcome."
