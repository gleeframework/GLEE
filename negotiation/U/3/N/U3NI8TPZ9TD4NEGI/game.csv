"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's close this deal now.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
