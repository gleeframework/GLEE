Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below John's standing offer.  It's unlikely Bob will reach the $1,200,000 mark quickly enough to justify continuing negotiations. Accepting John's offer guarantees the desired profit."
