"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm looking for a price around $22,000 to make it worthwhile. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be closer to $8,000 for me to consider it. What's the best you can do?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is far too low for me to consider.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right that $18,000 is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? That's my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $14,500 is just outside my budget.  I can do $10,500, which is a fair deal for both of us.  I need to be mindful of my spending, and this is the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,6,
