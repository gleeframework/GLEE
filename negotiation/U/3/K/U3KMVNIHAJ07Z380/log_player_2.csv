"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm looking for a price around $22,000 to make it worthwhile. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's clear you'll need to negotiate.  It's too early to buy from John at this stage, as you might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be closer to $8,000 for me to consider it. What's the best you can do?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, it establishes a starting point within your budget range.
* **Gauging Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** There's a large gap between your offer and Alice's, allowing room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is far too low for me to consider.  This product is truly top-of-the-line and offers significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved closer to your range, $18,000 is still significantly above your $10,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to bring the price down further. 
* **Alternative Available:**  Remember, you always have the option to buy from John for $10,000 if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $11,000? That's a fair offer considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** You've increased your offer significantly from $8,000 to show Alice you're serious while still staying below your $10,000 limit (giving yourself some wiggle room).
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""market value"" introduces an objective element to the negotiation, encouraging Alice to consider a more competitive price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests Alice's willingness to go below her stated midpoint and closer to your range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right that $18,000 is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see a strong return.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Be wary of ""final offer"" statements. It's often a negotiation tactic.
* **Still Above Budget:**  $14,500 is still significantly above your ideal price and what John offers.
* **Time to Push:** With rounds decreasing, now is the time to firmly push Alice closer to your acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $14,500 is just outside my budget.  I can do $10,500, which is a fair deal for both of us.  I need to be mindful of my spending, and this is the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Implied:** By stating this is the ""highest [you] can go,"" you're implying this is your final offer without directly saying it.
* **Slight Buffer:** Offering $10,500 gives a tiny buffer above John's price in case Alice counters very close to your limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  With fewer rounds remaining, this offer reinforces the need for Alice to accept a price closer to your range or risk losing the sale."
