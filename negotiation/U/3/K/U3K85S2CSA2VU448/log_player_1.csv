Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, so selling to John would not be a good deal. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a bit more than $87.50. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to work within your budget, but $87.50 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $88.50?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to go up to $86. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While selling to John is an option, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! Let's do $87.  That's a fair price for both of us and will let you get this great product you've been wanting."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. Can you do $84? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left, I need to make a decision. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not sure he'll go any higher. To guarantee I get at least $80, I'll sell the product to John."
