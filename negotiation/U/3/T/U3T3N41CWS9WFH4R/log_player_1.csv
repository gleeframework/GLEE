Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $200,000.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to find a price that is appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than his $1,200,000 valuation) but also maximizes your profit. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, emphasizing value and exclusivity to entice Bob.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves you with a significant profit of $150,000 over your guarantee. This leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($50,000 below his valuation).

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,150,000. He might try to negotiate further. You'd need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
