"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make a counteroffer. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I can do $1,000,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
