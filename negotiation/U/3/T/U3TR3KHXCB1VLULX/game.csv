"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but I think $1,100,000 is a little high.  Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we do $975,000? I think that's a fair offer.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
