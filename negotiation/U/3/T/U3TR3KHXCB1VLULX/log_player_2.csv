Alice's offer:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $175,000 less than John's price.
* **Reaching the Limit:**  Alice is firm on her price, and further haggling might make her less willing to negotiate. You risk getting stuck without a deal and ending up paying John's higher price. 
* **Time Value:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the product and lets you move on to other priorities."
