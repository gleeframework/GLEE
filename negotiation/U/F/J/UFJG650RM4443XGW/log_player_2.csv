"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's in my best interest to reject and make a counteroffer. I have a clear goal of staying under $800,000, and  $1,200,000 is a significant distance from that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify going over $800,000. Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $900,000 right now. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I was hoping we could get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm committed to staying under $800,000 and will continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  What do you say? "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price range, $1,025,000 is still above my limit of $800,000. I will continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. I still have more rounds to work with, and I don't want to settle for a price that is higher than my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the absolute highest I can go without jeopardizing my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay.  I've already made significant concessions and it's clear we're not going to find a middle ground.  It's better for me to secure the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000. This ensures I stay within my budget and avoid further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
