"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't justify going over $800,000. Let's meet in the middle - I'm prepared to offer $900,000 right now. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I was hoping we could get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  What do you say? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,025,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm prepared to go up to $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is the absolute highest I can go without jeopardizing my budget.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $975,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm hoping we can finally meet in the middle. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,7,
