Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her own minimum ($12,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing Alice closer to her ideal outcome.
* **Time Value & Guaranteed Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price. This avoids potential delays or complications with the sale to John."
