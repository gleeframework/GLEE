"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $8,500?  I think that's a fair price considering your value for it, and it's within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8,500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $8,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target. Would you consider $8,600? This would be a great deal for both of us.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your target, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $8,650, which is the lowest I can go. This is still a great deal for you, considering its worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?",8650.0,Alice,5,
