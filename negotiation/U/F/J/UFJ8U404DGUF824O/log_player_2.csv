"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is quite high, considering her product's worth to her is much lower. There's plenty of room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 seems a bit steep to me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it."",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  This counteroffer goes significantly below Alice's initial asking price. This signals strong interest in the product but establishes a lower baseline for negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $10,000 leaves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below both Alice's offer and John's alternative. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message keeps the tone polite and expresses a willingness to negotiate further, encouraging Alice to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  A $2,000 reduction indicates she's willing to deal, but we can likely get it lower.  Holding out keeps the pressure on her and might result in a more favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $11,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer makes a smaller jump ($1,000) than our previous one, showing Alice we're getting closer to a price we'd agree on. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By offering $11,000, we're trying to gauge how much further down Alice is willing to go.  Her response will give us a better idea of her bottom line.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** The message remains courteous and collaborative, keeping the negotiation moving forward in a positive manner."
