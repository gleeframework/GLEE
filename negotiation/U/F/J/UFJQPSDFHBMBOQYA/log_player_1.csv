Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,500 is more than your minimum price of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:**  By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your commitment to reaching a deal.

Remember, you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum price, it's still significantly less than what you initially proposed. It's worth continuing negotiations to see if you can reach a more favorable price.  

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than your initial offer, perhaps $11,000. This shows you are flexible but also determined to get a price closer to your initial value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}
