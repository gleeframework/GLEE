Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious investment in it. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this negotiation. While your valuation is understandable, the product's intrinsic value and potential benefits warrant a higher price.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,275,000. This price takes into account the product's value, but also reflects my own budget constraints. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is the most strategically sound option at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable Deal:**  This price is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, securing a good profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Prolonged negotiations can lead to frustration and potentially cause Bob to walk away entirely. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** John's standing offer of $1,200,000 is a safety net, but accepting Bob's offer guarantees a larger profit now."
