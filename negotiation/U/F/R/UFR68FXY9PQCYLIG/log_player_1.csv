{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this price reflects its worth while also allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $12,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $11,500 leaves Bob with a potential ""win"" by saving $500, making him more likely to accept.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 from John, so there's no risk of losing out entirely.

This offer aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still being attractive enough to close the deal."
