"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while recognizing your budget considerations.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're willing to accept.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
