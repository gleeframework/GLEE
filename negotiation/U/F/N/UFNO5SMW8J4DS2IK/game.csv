"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,075,000.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's get this done.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
