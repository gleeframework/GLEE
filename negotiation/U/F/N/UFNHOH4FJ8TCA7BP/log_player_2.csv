**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm happy to buy the product, but I'd need to get the price down to $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $10,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget of $10,000. I'll reject the offer and see if we can negotiate further.  I'm not comfortable going above my budget, but I'm willing to go a little higher if necessary."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my budget of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go significantly higher. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
