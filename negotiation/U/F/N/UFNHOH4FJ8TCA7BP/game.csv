"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm happy to buy the product, but I'd need to get the price down to $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but $10,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $11,250? It's a fair price for the product, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11250.0,Alice,5,
