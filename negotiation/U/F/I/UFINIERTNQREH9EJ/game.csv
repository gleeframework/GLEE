"Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'd be getting a great deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
