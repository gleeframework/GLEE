Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price point, even if it's a bit above your initial valuation."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $100 for the product, which is a fair price given its value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'd be getting a great deal."", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is already offering. Cutting my losses now and selling to John guarantees the best outcome for me."
