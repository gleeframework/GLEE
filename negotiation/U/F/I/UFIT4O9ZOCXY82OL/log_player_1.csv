Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,400,000.

I believe this price is fair and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.

I'm eager to move forward with the deal if we can come to an agreement.
