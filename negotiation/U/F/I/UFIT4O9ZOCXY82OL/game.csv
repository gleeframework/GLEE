"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer. I'm confident this product will generate significant value for your business, and I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,600,000. I believe this price is fair and allows for a win-win scenario for both of us. Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'd like to make a serious offer of $1,550,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. I'm eager to move forward with the deal if we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
