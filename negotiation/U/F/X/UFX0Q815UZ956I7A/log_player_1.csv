{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also using positive language to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $11,000 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
