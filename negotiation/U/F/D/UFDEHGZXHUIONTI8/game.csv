"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price of $1,300,000 is a more accurate reflection of that.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm confident this revised figure is more appropriate.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
