"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $95 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much on the price. I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment to $102.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
