"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering this product for a price of $1,800,000. I believe it presents a fantastic opportunity for you, even considering its high value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1800000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is equal to your minimum acceptable price. There's no room for further negotiation to increase your profit. You have a guaranteed offer from John at the same price, so it makes sense to sell to John and avoid further rounds of potentially fruitless negotiation."
