"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for it. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise while acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a firm budget. I can  increase my offer to $700,000.  This is a fair offer considering my maximum limit is $800,000.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept a price of $975,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your reduction is substantial, but it's still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $837,500? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer.",837500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $925,000.  I'm confident this offer reflects the product's true value and leaves very little room for further negotiation.",925000.0,Alice,7,
