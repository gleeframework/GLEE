,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit too high for me.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $95.  I'm confident we can make this work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 just isn't going to work for me. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $98? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",98.0,Alice,5,
