"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm curious to see Bob's reaction and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's potential to reach a price that's closer to my desired value.  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering with $85. This is a compromise between my minimum value of $80 and Bob's offer of $70.  I believe this price is reasonable and hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum value of $80, I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of securing a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm counter-offering with $82. This is a slight increase from my previous offer of $85, but it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and accept this offer.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiations, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $80, and with only 4 rounds left, the chance of reaching a price I'm happy with is getting slim. To guarantee a profit and avoid further negotiation, I'll choose to sell to John for $80."
