"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'll gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,500,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

```

I'm still aiming for a better price. I'll counter Bob's offer again, seeing if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding firm on a significant profit. This offer is a good compromise, and I'm hoping Bob sees it that way."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and I've already countered several times. There's a risk that he'll continue to lowball me, and I'm not sure if I can get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's better to be safe and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
