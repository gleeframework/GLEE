"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a steal for a product you know will be worth $15,000 to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $12,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
