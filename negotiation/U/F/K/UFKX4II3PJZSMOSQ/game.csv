,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  It's still a great deal for you, and it lets me get closer to what I need. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I am still unable to meet you at $100. I would like to stick to my budget of $80 if possible. Would you consider coming down to that price?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I can't go any lower than $90.  This is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree, I may have to move on to another buyer.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry to hear that you can't go any lower, Alice. I really appreciate your efforts, but I'm still hoping to stay within my budget of $80. I wonder if there's any possibility of meeting me at this price point?",80.0,Bob,6,
