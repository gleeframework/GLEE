Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Since Bob values the product at $15,000, the maximum price he might accept is slightly below that.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he desires, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Plan:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while considering Bob's potential counter-offer and the security of a backup buyer."
