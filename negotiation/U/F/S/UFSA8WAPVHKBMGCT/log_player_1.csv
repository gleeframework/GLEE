"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and believe it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe $120 is a fair price considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, which matches Bob's offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I can sell the product to John immediately at my minimum acceptable price."
