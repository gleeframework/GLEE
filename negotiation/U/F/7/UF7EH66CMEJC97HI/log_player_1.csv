Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000? This offer reflects the value this product brings."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is inching closer, we are still far above our minimum and have room to negotiate. By continuing the back-and-forth, we might be able to secure a price closer to $1,300,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'll come down slightly.  How about $1,280,000?  This is my final offer."",
 ""product_price"": 1280000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** By stating this is our final offer, we signal seriousness and a limit to our flexibility.
* **Strategic concession:**  We're conceding, but in smaller increments ($20,000 vs. $50,000), showing we're getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Time pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds. Putting slight time pressure can push Bob towards a decision."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer. How about $1,240,000? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,240,000 is a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increases,  and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means we have the capital sooner, which has its own value. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting Bob's offer can be seen as a gesture of goodwill, potentially leading to future business."
