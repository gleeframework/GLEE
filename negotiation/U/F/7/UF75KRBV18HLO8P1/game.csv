"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm keen on the product but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. While $1,400,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,100,000. Would you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your continued engagement.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,275,000. This offer reflects the value I place on the product.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the latest offer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, I'm very close to taking you up on that offer, but $1,275,000 is still just a bit beyond my budget. Could we settle at $1,225,000? I'm hoping this can be our final agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
