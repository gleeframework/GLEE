"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm not able to disclose specifics at this time, but I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm willing to let you have it for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I'll be moving on to another buyer.  Think about it, and let me know your decision.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
