Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering the benefits it will bring you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still landing within a range that's highly profitable for you.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the high price, making it more palatable for Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counter-offers.  You have a strong fallback position with John at $800,000."
