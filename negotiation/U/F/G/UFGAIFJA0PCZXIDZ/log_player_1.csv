While I recognize you see the value, my original pricing reflects the true potential of this product.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,700,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need a price that works for my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his latest offer is still significantly below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
