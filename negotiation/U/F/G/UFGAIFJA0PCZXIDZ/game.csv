"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you see the value, my original pricing reflects the true potential of this product.  To move towards a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the significant returns you'll see.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,700,000 is still out of my range. I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I need a price that works for my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,400,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
