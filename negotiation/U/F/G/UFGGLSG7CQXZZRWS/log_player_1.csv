Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 (John's price), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a higher profit than if I waited for John.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still attractive enough that he might be tempted.  
* **Time Value:** Selling quickly to Bob avoids potential delays in finding another buyer (even though John is lined up).

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still ensuring a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
