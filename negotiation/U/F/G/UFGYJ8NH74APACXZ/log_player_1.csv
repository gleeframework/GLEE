"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,500, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the reduction, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $9,000 is a good compromise. It's still a profitable sale, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
