You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* You're trying to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's initial offer is your maximum price. 
* There's no reason to accept her offer immediately. 
* You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

**Reasoning:**

* You're trying to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $85 is still higher than your desired price, but lower than her initial offer, so it's a step in the right direction.
*  There's still room for negotiation, so you can try for a lower price."
