"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  I want to see if he's willing to pay close to my ideal price point, while leaving myself space to adjust if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my ideal price point and my minimum. I want to explore if there's more room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is closer to my target price, I'm still not entirely satisfied. There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'll come down to $10,400.  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,400, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,200 is tempting, it's still below my minimum.  I believe there's still potential for a higher offer, and I'm not ready to settle for less.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $10,300. This is a fair price for both of us. It allows me to make a profit while still providing you with a great deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,150? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob seems to be going nowhere. The price is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not convinced I can get a better offer from him. To ensure I don't lose out on any profit, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. This guarantees I won't lose money and still gets me a decent return."
