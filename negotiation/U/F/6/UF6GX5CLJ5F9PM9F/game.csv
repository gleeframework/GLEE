"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'll come down to $10,400.  That's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,400, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $10,300. This is a fair price for both of us. It allows me to make a profit while still providing you with a great deal. Let's close this deal.",10300.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,300. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10,150? I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",10150.0,Bob,8,
