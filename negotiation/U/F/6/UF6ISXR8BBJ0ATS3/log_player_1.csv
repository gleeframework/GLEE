"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired value by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $10,500?  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value just yet.  I'll try to push for a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $9,800 is closer, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $10,200? It's a compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and we're running out of rounds.  John is offering my minimum, and it's a safer bet to secure the sale now rather than risk getting nothing at all from Bob."
