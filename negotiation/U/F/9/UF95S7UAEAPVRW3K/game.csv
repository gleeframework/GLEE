"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $10,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for the product. This price would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $9,750? It's a compromise that should benefit both of us. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm prepared to pay. Let's split the difference again, how about $9,125? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you think?",9125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to accept $9,125. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we try $9,500? It's a small step closer to my original offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value I have in mind. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
