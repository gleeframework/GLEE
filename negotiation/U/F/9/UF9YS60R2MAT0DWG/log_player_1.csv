Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is higher than what the product is worth to him, but still lower than what it's worth to me, leaving some room for negotiation.  This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer, while still allowing me to make a good profit. If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I also have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is a better price than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or, in the worst case,  sell to John for my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,750. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I've already had two rounds of negotiation, and I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob. John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so it's the best option at this point."
