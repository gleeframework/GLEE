"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90, slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I can adjust my price down in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, I am not willing to accept such a low price.  I will counter-offer in the next round to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay less while still remaining within a reasonable range for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $78 is close to my minimum price, I am not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price with further negotiation. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to offer $82. This is still higher than Bob's last offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to make a deal before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer of $79 is very close to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. John is guaranteed to pay my minimum, so it's the safest option at this point."
