This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. This also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm willing to lower the price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation but still value the product highly."
