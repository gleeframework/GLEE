Round 3
Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. To make this happen, I could come down to $140. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her ""final offer"" of $140 is still more than your maximum price and more importantly, higher than John's standing offer of $120. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
