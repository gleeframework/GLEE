Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my potential profit and still being appealing to Bob.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than my minimum:** I'm still getting more than my $80 minimum.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $20 compared to what he's willing to pay.
* **It's attractive compared to the alternative:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell it to John for $80. This offer gives me a better chance of getting a higher price."
