"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's equally valuable to you. I'm starting with an offer of $2000000. Let's see if we can come to a deal!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2000000 is a lot higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1700000 is closer, it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting this product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1350000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in your product. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $1100000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer the product for $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping you see the value in this and we can finally come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've really enjoyed our negotiation, but $1200000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $1150000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1150000 still doesn't quite reach my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to go down to $1175000 as a final compromise. This offer takes into account your budget and reflects the true value of the product. I hope we can finalize this deal in this round.",1175000.0,Alice,9,
