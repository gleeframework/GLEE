"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
