"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  Since John offers the product for $8,000, it makes more sense to cut the negotiation short and buy from John to secure the best possible price."
