"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1200000, which is a 20% discount from the true value of $1500000, but still a significant profit for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  To make this deal work, I'd need to see a price closer to $800000. This would still allow you a substantial profit while giving me a good value.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1000000. I'm confident that the product will bring significant value to your business, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
