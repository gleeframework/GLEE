Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000, which is a 20% discount from the true value of $1,500,000, but still a significant profit for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is still significantly higher than my budget.  To make this deal work, I'd need to see a price closer to $800000. This would still allow you a substantial profit while giving me a good value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
