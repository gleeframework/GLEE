"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a little concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $102, which is still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
