"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $120 and John is selling it for that price, there's no point in negotiating with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point."
