"Hi Alice,  $200 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell the product to you for $175.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $155?  That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll sell the product to you for $165.",165.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $165 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm really close to my limit, but I can do $160. If we can agree on that, I'll take it. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",160.0,Bob,6,
