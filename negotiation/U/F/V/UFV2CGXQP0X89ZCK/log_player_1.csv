Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,200,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($1,500,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $1,200,000.
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at our desired price. This gives us leverage in the negotiation."
