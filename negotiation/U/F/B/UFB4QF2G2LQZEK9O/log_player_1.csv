Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you need to price it above that to make a profit with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 gives you a starting point.  You want to aim significantly higher than that.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob.  He might try to counter-offer, but you have a strong bottom line with John's offer.
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly."
