Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on that price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still looking to stay under $8,800.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,780?  That's a small difference but it would make this deal work for me.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at $8,800. It's a small difference, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I wanted to get a bit more, we've been negotiating for a while, and $8,800 is close enough to my minimum price. It's better than selling to John for $8,000, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate."
