"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but still within a range that Bob might be willing to pay.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $100. I'm confident I can do better in the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better deal with a counteroffer. I'm not desperate to sell yet, and I'm confident I can close the deal at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 102}
```

I'm going to counter with $102. I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe Bob is starting to realize that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product. I hope he'll accept this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $98 is very close to my minimum value, I'm not going to sell for less than what I think it's worth. I'm confident that I can either get a better price from Bob in the next round or sell to John for my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is my absolute minimum value for the product, and I'm confident that Bob will accept it at this point. He's been steadily increasing his offer, and I'm sure he'll recognize that this is a fair price for both of us."
