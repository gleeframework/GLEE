"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $950,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $925,000, which would be $887,500. Can you consider this offer?",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  While $887,500 is closer, I still need to be closer to $900,000 to make this work for me.  Let's split the difference again and aim for $906,250. This would give us both a good outcome.",906250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, this time between $887,500 and $906,250, which would be $896,875. Can you consider this offer?",896875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, this time between $896,875 and $906,250, which comes to $901,562.50. Let's seal the deal with this fair and mutually beneficial price.",901562.5,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $895,000, but no higher. Can you consider this offer?",895000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, between $895,000 and $901,562.50, which comes to $898,281.25. This is the absolute best I can offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer. ",898281.25,Alice,9,

This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",896640.63,Bob,10,
