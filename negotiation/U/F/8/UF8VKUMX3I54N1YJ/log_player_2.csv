``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from Alice, which saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further**, the goal is to save as much money as possible. Accepting her offer achieves that goal."
