"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value it brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer.  $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. How about $9,500?  That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,000. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
