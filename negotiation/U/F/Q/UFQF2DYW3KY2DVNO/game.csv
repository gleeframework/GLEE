"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,200,000.  This leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However,  $1,100,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise. I'm proposing a final price of $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1150000.0,Alice,5,
