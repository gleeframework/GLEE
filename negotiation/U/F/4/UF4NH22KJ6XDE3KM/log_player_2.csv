"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than my minimum asking price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for your company.  This is a one-time opportunity, and if you decline, I'll be moving forward with another buyer who is already interested. Please consider this offer carefully, as it presents a significant advantage for your business.
