"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,200,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my desired price.  How about $1,350,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it allows me to get closer to the value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,350,000 is still a bit above my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
