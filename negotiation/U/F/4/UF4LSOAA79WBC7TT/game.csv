"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $9000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $8500? It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $8500 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we split the difference and go with $8250? This would be a good deal for both of us and we could finalize the transaction.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $8250. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $8400? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.",8400.0,Alice,5,
