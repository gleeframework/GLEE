"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $8000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $8500? It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still aiming for a price lower than $8,500.  While it's tempting to take the compromise, you can likely get closer to your desired price with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $8250. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we try $8400? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400

Alice has come down to $8,400, which is a better deal than John's $10,000.  While you could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a better price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether. Accepting the offer at this point is the most sensible choice."
