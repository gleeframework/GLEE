Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers. I think it would be very valuable to you. How about a price of $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring we are well above our minimum. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, we get a good price. If he rejects, we have John as a guaranteed backup."
