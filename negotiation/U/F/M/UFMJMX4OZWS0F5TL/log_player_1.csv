Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,000 is more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer and for you to negotiate. 
* **It's a strong opening:** A slightly aggressive offer can encourage Bob to seriously consider your proposal.

**Important Note:** The negotiation strategy should evolve based on Bob's responses and the time constraints you face."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is still above your minimum of $10,000, but it's closer to your initial offer than you'd like. Since you have the option to sell to John for $10,000, rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer with a price closer to your initial $13,000. Consider a price like $12,800. This shows Bob you're willing to compromise but also that you're not desperate to sell at his first counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,800 is closer to where I need to be.  It's a good compromise, and it leaves a fair amount of value for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to your initial offer:**  It's a small move closer to your $13,000 price, showing you're willing to compromise but not drastically dropping your price.
* **Focuses on compromise:**  The message emphasizes that this price is fair for both sides, creating a positive tone for continued negotiations. 
* **Leaves room for a final deal:**  If Bob rejects, there's still a bit more wiggle room to negotiate. 

Remember:  You can always adjust the counteroffer based on Bob's reactions and your own sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12200, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,200 is lower than your initial price and your counteroffer, it's still above your minimum of $10,000.  Considering the following:

* **You can always sell to John:**  You have a guaranteed sale for $10,000, so you're not taking a huge loss. 
* **Negotiating further might be unproductive:**  Bob has already stated his maximum, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or an even lower offer. 
* **The price is still good:**  $12,200 is a significant profit for you, and it's likely that you won't be able to get much more from Bob.

**Conclusion:**

It's best to accept Bob's offer and close the deal.  You can potentially save time and effort, and you'll still make a good profit."
