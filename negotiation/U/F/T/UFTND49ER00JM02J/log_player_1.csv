Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.

Offering the product at $14,999 creates a sense of urgency and a ""deal"" for Bob while still securing almost the maximum profit. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate, but you have a strong fallback position with John."
