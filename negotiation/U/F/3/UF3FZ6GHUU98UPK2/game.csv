"I'm not willing to go as low as $125, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $135, so I'm offering it to you for $130. Is that something you'd be interested in?",130.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $127, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $129. This is my last offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",129.0,Alice,9,
