"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is really my starting point given the value this product offers. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  Let's split the difference - how about $12,500? It's a fair price that shows I'm serious about buying the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I appreciate that.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? That's my final offer, as I need to be fair to myself regarding the product's worth.",13750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still sticking with $12,500. That's a fair price considering our previous discussions and the product's value to me.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price, so let's make it happen!",12500.0,Bob,6,
