Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale. I think it's really fantastic and would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 for it."",
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a higher price ($150) allows room for negotiation.  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of getting a price higher than the $100 minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! That's a bit too pricey for me though. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $70 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own valuation of the product ($100).  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $70 is too low for me. Could you do $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Compromise:** We're coming down from the initial offer ($150) to show willingness to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** $130 keeps us comfortably above our $100 minimum and allows room for further negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $100 to Bob, so there's a chance he might be willing to go up to $130 if he's motivated to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you considering my offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $100 matches both our minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer. There's no benefit to further negotiation or risking the deal by pushing for more. Accepting now secures a fair price."
