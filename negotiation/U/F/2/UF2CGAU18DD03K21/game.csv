,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is beyond my budget. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value.  To be frank, $850,000 falls significantly short of what I consider a fair deal.  I'm willing to move down to $1,025,000. This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still above my comfort zone.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $925,000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price point given my budget constraints.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but the reality is that $925,000 doesn't align with the value this product brings.  My final offer is $975,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,5,
