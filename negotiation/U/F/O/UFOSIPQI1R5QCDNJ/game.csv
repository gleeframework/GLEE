"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my initial price reflects the true value and potential of this product. While I understand your perspective,  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price point is still very reasonable given the potential return on investment you'll gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial price, but I still think $1,900,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
