"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  While $950000 is closer, it's still a bit too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $975000. It's a fair price for both of us, and will allow us to move forward with this transaction. What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $965000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",965000.0,Bob,6,
