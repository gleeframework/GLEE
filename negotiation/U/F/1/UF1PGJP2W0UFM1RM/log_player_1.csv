Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price just below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good deal.  I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob, but allows room for him to counteroffer if he feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's tempting to accept, I want to try to get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm lowering my price a bit to show willingness to negotiate, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This price is closer to the middle ground, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still not close enough to my desired price. I'm not willing to risk going another round and potentially getting an even lower offer.  John is offering a price that meets my minimum, so I'll take that deal and secure my desired profit."
