This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation while still ensuring I am able to earn more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $12000 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I am not willing to settle right away. I want to see if there is any wiggle room for a higher price.  I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're working with a budget, Bob. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 for the product. This price still reflects its value and allows me some room to negotiate.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still aiming to keep the cost within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $14000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is close to my desired price point and  I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn.  I'll accept his offer of $14,000."
