You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}

$90 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can get closer to $85."
