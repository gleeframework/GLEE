"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8000. What do you think?",7000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your offer of $6500, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's value to me is $8000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $6900. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted price. What do you think?",6900.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $6300. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is lower than its value to you.",6300.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your revised offer of $6300, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $6500, but this is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,5,
