Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell it for less.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **John's value:** John is willing to pay $15,000, which is my minimum.
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'm offering $14,000, which is a compromise between my minimum and Bob's maximum. This gives Bob a decent discount while still allowing me to earn more than I would by selling to John.

This strategy maximizes my chances of a successful sale to Bob while also ensuring I can still get my minimum price if he declines."
