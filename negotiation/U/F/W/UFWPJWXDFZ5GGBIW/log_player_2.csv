The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. This is a good deal, but I can try to get an even better price. I will reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal. It's still lower than my initial valuation of $1,200,000 and closer to my target price of $1,000,000. I'll accept the offer and save $150,000."
