{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is considerably higher than my minimum threshold of $8,000. It also highlights the potential value Bob will gain from the product.  This strategy allows for room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit."
