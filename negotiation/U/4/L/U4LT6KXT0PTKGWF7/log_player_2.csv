"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget of $800,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a good fallback option with John, so there's no risk in pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price but still within a reasonable range. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying within your budget.  This gives Alice a chance to consider your offer and potentially come closer to your desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is still higher than your budget, and shows she's unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $800,000. It guarantees you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
