Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $16,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a price of $16,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,000. This is my final concession, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly on price. She went up from $16,000 to $17,000, indicating she's unlikely to accept an offer close to your $13,500. At this point, it's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $15,000. You'll save $2,000 and avoid potentially wasting more time in a negotiation that seems to be going nowhere."
