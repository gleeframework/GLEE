"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $16,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a price of $16,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $17,000. This is my final concession, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",17000.0,Alice,5,
