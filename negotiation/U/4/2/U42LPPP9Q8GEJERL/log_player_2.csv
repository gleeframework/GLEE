Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $1400000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above my minimum price.  I have another buyer, John, who's willing to pay $1500000 for the product.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to accept John's offer.
