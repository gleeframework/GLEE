{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, hoping to build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not going to accept it. I'm going to try to counteroffer him, seeing if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,750 is still slightly below my minimum price, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'm going to accept his offer, as it's closer to my desired price point and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
