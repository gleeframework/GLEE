Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is too high for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! $1,150,000 is definitely an improvement. However, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I believe this price is fair considering our negotiation progress and the product's value.
