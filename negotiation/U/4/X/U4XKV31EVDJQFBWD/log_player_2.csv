"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm willing to offer it for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $135 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $135 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal considering he was initially willing to pay $150 to John. Accepting this offer saves Bob $20 compared to buying from John."
