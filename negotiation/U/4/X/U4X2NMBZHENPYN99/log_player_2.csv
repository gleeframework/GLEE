Round 3

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer! While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,750 is still a bit too low. Let's try $14,000. I think that's a fair compromise that allows us both to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're close to John's price:** Alice is holding firm at $14,000. John's price is $15,000. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significant difference.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're running out of rounds. If we keep pushing and fail, we might end up having to buy from John anyway.

Accepting at $14,000 secures a reasonable deal without risking losing the product altogether."
