"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's not worth accepting at this point.  You have two better options: 

1. **Reject and counteroffer:** You can attempt to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. 
2. **Buy from John:** This is the safest option as it guarantees you get the product within your budget. 

However, since the goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your limit.  You can try to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to drop the price even lower. You're still within your budget range to continue negotiating, and you could potentially get the product for a better price than John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm really serious about buying this product, so how about we settle on $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $12,500. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your budget. While you're close to a potential deal, it's important to remember your goal is to save as much money as possible.  At this point, you've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiations, and the likelihood of Alice coming down to your price is low. 

John offers the product at your maximum budget, so going with John guarantees you the product while staying within your financial limits."
