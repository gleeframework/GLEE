I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a strong opening offer that leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so I don't need to accept any offers that are lower than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

I'm countering with $1,450,000. It's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum value and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, it's still above my minimum value of $1,000,000. Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away, and I'm comfortable with the price."
