{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You're still getting a profit and leaving room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable amount:**  It shows you're serious about selling but not desperate. 

By starting with this offer, you open the negotiation and get a feel for Bob's willingness to pay. You can adjust your strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I will counteroffer Bob to try and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer addresses Bob's concerns by acknowledging his perspective while holding firm on my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to compromise but only to a certain extent. By offering $9,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still ensuring a profitable transaction for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  It's risky to accept Bob's offer because there's a chance he might reject my counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hoping to negotiate a better price. However, I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting close but $8,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and do $9,400. This would be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 9400} 
```

This is my final counteroffer to Bob.  I'm offering a price that's close to his target, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows that I'm flexible and willing to work with him, but also that I'm not desperate to sell.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to John."
