{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product might be high to you, but I am looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? I am very interested in purchasing this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I am not comfortable accepting $10,000 for a product worth at least $10,000 to me.  It's a good starting point, but I believe the product's value warrants a higher price.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget concerns, I need to ensure a fair return on this valuable item.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still reflects the product's quality and potential benefits to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $11000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum.  With only 6 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating.  It's better to secure a sale than risk losing him and being stuck with the lower offer from John."
