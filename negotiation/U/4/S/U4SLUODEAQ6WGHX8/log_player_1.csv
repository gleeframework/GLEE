"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm starting at $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to start at a price that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the value of the product to me.
* **Being open:** I want to signal that I'm willing to work with Bob, making him more likely to engage.
* **Positive tone:**  I want to create a positive and collaborative environment for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I've stated that the product is worth at least $100 to me.  Bob's offer is at my minimum, so accepting it wouldn't give me any profit. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Time to counter:**  I'll use this round to make a counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, showing a willingness to meet Bob halfway.  
* **Fairness:**  $125 is a reasonable midpoint between my starting price and Bob's offer.
* **Encouragement:** I'm highlighting that it's still a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit margin:** Bob's offer of $115 gives me a profit of $15, which is better than selling to John for $100.
* **Limited time:** We're already in round 4, and time is running out.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While $115 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it for now, knowing that I could potentially get a better price in future rounds."
