"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, allowing for some potential negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $90 is still a good deal. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and we're already on round 2. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
