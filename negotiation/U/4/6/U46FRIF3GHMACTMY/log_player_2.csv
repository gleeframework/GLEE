# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it!

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.  You should try to counteroffer and get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I can offer you a compromise at $950,000, which is still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her original $900,000, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to counteroffer again, as you can potentially get a lower price."
