"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, which means you wouldn't save any money by accepting.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John, also for $12,000. 
* The choice between Alice and John doesn't impact the price you pay, so there's no benefit to one seller over the other."
