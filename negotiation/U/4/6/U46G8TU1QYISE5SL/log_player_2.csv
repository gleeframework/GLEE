"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or go with John directly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message aims to be polite while clearly stating my budget limitations.
* **Strategic Goal:** My ideal outcome is to pay somewhere between $80 and $100. I need to give Alice a reason to keep negotiating with me instead of moving on to other potential buyers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met my ideal price point. There's no point in negotiating further, as I can't get a better deal from John. Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
