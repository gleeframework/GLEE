Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $700,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. I'll accept $850,000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that benefits both of us.

We're still getting a better deal than John's offer, and there's room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a price below $800,000.  While $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $825,000 for the product. This is a very competitive price considering the value you place on it. It's also a significant reduction from my previous offers. I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
