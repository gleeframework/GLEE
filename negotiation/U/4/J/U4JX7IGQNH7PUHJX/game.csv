"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me.  However, $1,600,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
