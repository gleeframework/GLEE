"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to sell to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for further negotiation. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lower bound and secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. It's still a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll continue to counter-offer, aiming to reach a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're inching closer to a price that works for both of us. Let's see if Alice is willing to meet us in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you think $95 is a fair compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50, which is still a great deal for you and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to stay above $100, and we're running the risk of her increasing the price again.  $102.50 is a reasonable compromise, saving us $17.50 compared to John's offer."
