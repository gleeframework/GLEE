"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay closer to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",750000.0,Alice,3,
