"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle? Would you be willing to go up to $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $1,220,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
