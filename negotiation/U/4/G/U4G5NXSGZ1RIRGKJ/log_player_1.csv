Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly avoids delays and potential complications.  
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is a strong compromise:
    * It's significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000, creating a sense of urgency.
    * It leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice, exceeding her minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties (even if John is the only one) adds a subtle pressure for Bob to act fast."
