Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $10,000.  I believe it offers significant value, but I'm aiming for a quick sale.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim to sell it to Bob for the same price to maximize my profit. 
* **Avoid Loss:** Offering it below $10,000 would be a loss compared to selling to John.
* **Direct Approach:**  The message is clear and emphasizes the value proposition while making it clear this offer is time-limited to encourage a decision."
