Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially earn a considerable profit. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  By starting high, you establish your perceived value of the product and set a benchmark for negotiations.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  This approach allows for negotiation and potential compromise without immediately risking a deal breakdown.
* **Exploring Bob's Value:** This tactic helps you gauge how much Bob values the product and his willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000.

Remember, the key is to find the balance between maximizing your earnings and ensuring a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** I am not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. 
* **I can still potentially get a better price from Bob.** Even though his initial offer was low, there's still a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I want to see if I can do better.** While selling to John is a safe option, I'm still hopeful for a higher price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I'll need to carefully consider a counteroffer that is high enough to be attractive to Bob but also reflects the product's value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $2,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  The price is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring that I'm not selling at a loss.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see how far he's willing to go.

**Potential Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  This would be a successful negotiation and earn me a substantial profit.
* **Bob rejects and counters with a higher price:**  This indicates a strong interest from Bob, and I can continue negotiating.
* **Bob rejects and counters with a lower price or walks away:**  This would signal that we may not reach an agreement, making selling to John the more sensible option."
