"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the high demand, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $15,000. There's no reason to accept it at this point. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise while staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $13,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your maximum budget, it's still above your desired price. It's worth continuing to negotiate. You can try a counteroffer closer to the middle ground, but still below $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and meet at $16,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between the previous offers. It's a reasonable price for Bob, and still gives Alice a profit margin. This counteroffer sets the stage for a potential deal in the next round."
