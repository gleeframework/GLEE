"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so starting significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) provides room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial high offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and potential for a deal within our desired price range. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the safety net of John's offer ($1,500,000), allowing us to be firm in our negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to our desired range, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal. We are also safe knowing we have John's offer as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value this product brings is truly substantial. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're showing flexibility by coming down slightly from our initial offer, indicating willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The $1,900,000 price point keeps us comfortably above both Bob's offer and our minimum acceptable price.
* **Encouraging a Response:** By suggesting a middle ground, we encourage Bob to re-evaluate his position and potentially offer a counter-proposal closer to our target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered Alice's latest offer, but I still feel that the product's value aligns better with my budget if we could meet closer to my previous proposal. Would $1,850,000 be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow and Steady:** Bob is moving closer to our range, but in smaller increments. This suggests he's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to improve his position. 
* **Time Considerations:** We still have several rounds left, allowing us to continue negotiating strategically without rushing into a less-than-ideal deal.  We're not losing a significant amount of potential profit by holding out at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a solution. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need you to meet me closer to my previous price. Would you consider $1,875,000?"",
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Flexibility:** We're making another small concession, demonstrating our interest in closing the deal.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer effectively splits the difference between his previous offer ($1,850,000) and ours ($1,900,000), suggesting a fair compromise.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By continually nudging the price closer to our target, we maintain negotiating momentum and keep the pressure on Bob to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I believe we can find a common ground here. How about we aim for $1,860,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob's offer of $1,860,000 is a good deal. It's significantly above his perceived value and represents a successful negotiation on our part.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the potential gains are becoming smaller.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Bob walking away or becoming frustrated.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now allows us to reinvest the earnings sooner, potentially generating further returns. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Dragging out the negotiations with Bob might cause us to miss out on other potential buyers or investment opportunities."
