"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've personally valued at no less than $10000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12500. This is a fair price that allows me to make a profit while still giving you a significant discount from its true worth. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
