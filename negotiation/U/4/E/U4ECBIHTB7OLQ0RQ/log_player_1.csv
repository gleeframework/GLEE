"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $800,000, I start significantly higher to leave room for negotiation. This also establishes a strong initial position.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product without being too specific. This allows Bob to justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The tone remains open and positive, inviting Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I can sell to John for my minimum price, giving me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still considerably lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to keep the conversation going."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. Considering the unique value proposition of this product, I can bring it down to $1,050,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm coming down by $50,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $50,000. While movement is good, at this pace, reaching an acceptable agreement within the remaining rounds seems unlikely.
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of selling to John for my desired price. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  I'll reject Bob's offer and propose a counter-offer closer to my minimum.  This will signal the seriousness of my position and prompt him to make a more significant move if he's genuinely interested."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, to be completely transparent, I have another potential buyer for this price point. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000, but that's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer, adding a sense of urgency.
* **Mentioning Another Buyer:**  This introduces a mild pressure tactic without revealing the full extent of my alternative (John's offer). 
* **Final Push:** This counter-offer will signal to Bob that he needs to make a significant move if he wants to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another potential buyer, but I'm still confident that I can make a good deal. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:**  Bob's final offer of $980,000 is still significantly below my $1,200,000 minimum. Further negotiation seems unlikely to bridge this gap significantly.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds remaining and Bob holding firm, the potential for a breakthrough is low. It's not worth the risk of missing out on John's offer.
* **Guaranteed Return:** Selling to John guarantees my desired price without further negotiation or uncertainty.

**Important Note:** While Bob's offer is tempting, it's crucial to prioritize my bottom line and minimize risk.  The guaranteed sale to John ensures a profitable outcome in this situation."
