Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:**  This offer allows me to either accept a counteroffer closer to my minimum or move on to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Value of Time:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that amount with Bob.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation active and allows me to demonstrate my willingness to stand firm on my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $950,000. This price still offers you a significant value and allows me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Compromise and Value:** I present the price as a compromise (""meet in the middle"") and reiterate the value the product offers Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 

This counteroffer balances the need to secure a good price with the risk of Bob walking away and potentially leading to a sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me and the value you're placing on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth, and while Bob is willing to pay more than his initial offer, we're still far from my desired price.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer and closer to my minimum desired price. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a higher price.  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation and a potential lower price.

Even though I could continue negotiating with Bob, the potential gains don't outweigh the certainty of a higher price and the time saved by selling to John."
