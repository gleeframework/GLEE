"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested! I'm willing to go down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to get this for $10,250.  Would you consider that?  I'm very interested in purchasing and we could potentially close the deal quickly.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,250 is still too low.  Let's compromise at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $10,750 is still above my budget.  I'm really hoping to get this for $10,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can pay.  If you're willing to come down to that, we can finalize the deal immediately.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,6,
