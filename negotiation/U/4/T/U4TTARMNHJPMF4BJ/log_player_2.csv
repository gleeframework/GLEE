"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, you can still get a better deal. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so rejecting and counteroffering gives you a chance to get closer to your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested! I'm willing to go down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Rejecting and counteroffering again will give me a chance to get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10,250 is still too low.  Let's compromise at $10,750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, but $10,750 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm sticking to my goal of $10,000. Rejecting and counteroffering again gives me a chance to try and push her down to my price, or at least get closer to it.  It's worth the risk, as I have a backup option in John."
