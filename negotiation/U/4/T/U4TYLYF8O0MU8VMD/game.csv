"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $14,000 is close, but I need to get at least $15,500 for it to make sense on my end.  Would you be willing to consider that?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still willing to work with you. Can we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
