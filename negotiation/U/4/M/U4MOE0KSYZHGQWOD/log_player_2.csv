"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. While I can't disclose the exact details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $10000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for $15000, a price I believe reflects its true value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $10000 if you decline. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While Alice claims the product is worth more to her, it doesn't matter for Bob. He can get the same product from John for $12,000. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to save $3,000."
