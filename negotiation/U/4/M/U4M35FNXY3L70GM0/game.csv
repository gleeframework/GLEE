"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,600,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still slightly out of my reach. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
