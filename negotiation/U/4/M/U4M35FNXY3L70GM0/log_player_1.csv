"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is still a significant sum, it's too far below my minimum acceptable price. I believe we can still reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,600,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still slightly out of my reach. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like we've reached a mutually agreeable point.  It's important to close this deal before we run out of time."
