This price reflects a strategic midpoint between the intrinsic value of the product and your perceived worth, aiming to create a mutually beneficial transaction. I trust this offer will be appealing and look forward to discussing further details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal for him."
