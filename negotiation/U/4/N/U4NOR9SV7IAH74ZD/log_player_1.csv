Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to part with it for $135. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we want to see if we can get a bit more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $15 markup (12.5%) is a reasonable starting point. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **First Refusal Incentive:** By framing the offer as a ""pre-listing"" opportunity, we create a sense of exclusivity and potential loss aversion for Bob, encouraging him to act quickly. 

If Bob rejects the offer, we can always sell to John at our minimum acceptable price of $120."
