"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $12,000 to me, and I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $11,000. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price, hoping that Bob is getting closer to my desired value."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm getting close to my minimum, but the negotiations are taking longer than I anticipated.  I'm confident that I can sell to John for a much higher price. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
