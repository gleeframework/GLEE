"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price than $12,000, as Alice values the product at $8,000. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still significantly higher than Alice's valuation ($8,000) but lower than Alice's initial offer ($12,000). This is a good starting point for negotiation, giving Alice some room to counter while still saving Bob money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Since Alice is willing to negotiate, Bob should try to push for a lower price.  There's still room for Bob to make a counteroffer that could be acceptable to Alice, and it would be worth exploring those options rather than settling for $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate, but still keeping the price lower than Alice's latest offer. This small increment might entice Alice to accept, especially as it's still well above her valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a significant savings for Bob compared to John's price of $15,000. While there is always a chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without taking on unnecessary risk."
