"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.  Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my perspective. I'm still not able to meet at $17,000. I would like to propose $14,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
