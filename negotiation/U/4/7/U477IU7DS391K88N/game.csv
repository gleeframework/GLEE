"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be a great fit for you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could be flexible, but I can't go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $10,000?  I think that's a fair offer considering the current market.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I see you're serious about this product.  While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to consider it if we can settle on $12,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
