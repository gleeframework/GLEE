"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.

"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
