"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation and ensures a mutually beneficial deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,225,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a reasonable price. I'm aiming to maximize profit and believe I can still negotiate a better deal than $1,225,000 within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to accept $1,280,000 for this product. This reflects my desire to close the deal while acknowledging its inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1280000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm strategically conceding a smaller amount to entice Bob while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. This keeps the negotiation moving and increases the likelihood of a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best deal possible. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still securing a $250,000 profit above my minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now guarantees the deal.
* **Relationship:** Ending on a positive note with a mutually agreeable price can foster goodwill for future potential interactions. 
 
It's a strong offer, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result."
