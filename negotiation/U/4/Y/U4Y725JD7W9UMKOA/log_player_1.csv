Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I remind Bob that the product is valuable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and try to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* If negotiation fails or drags on, I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can get Bob to budge further.
* **Risk Assessment:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I'm willing to risk a little more negotiation to see if I can get a better deal from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $9,000. I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my minimum while still appealing to Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows me to cover my costs while still giving you a great deal. Let's meet in the middle on this!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Empathy:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns to show I'm willing to work with him.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I'll have secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to carefully consider whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. The longer the negotiation goes, the higher the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $12,000. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  I'm concerned that further negotiation will drag on and ultimately lead to a stalemate. Bob might not be willing to budge much further, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. 

**Next Steps:**

Given the risk of continued negotiation and the certainty of a good profit with John, I'm choosing to sell to John. This is the most financially sound decision in this situation."
