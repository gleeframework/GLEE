Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.
