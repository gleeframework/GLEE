"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still provides you with a substantial profit and reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it allows me to secure a good return on my investment.  Let's close this deal and get this product into your hands.
