"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. It's a fair price considering my budget and what I'm willing to pay.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1400000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1600000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1300000. It's a fair price considering my constraints and what I'm willing to pay.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still a significant savings for you compared to my initial offer. I'm confident this is a deal we can both be happy with.",1500000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1500000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
