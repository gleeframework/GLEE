"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 would be a fair starting point for negotiations. This reflects the value I see in the product while still being within my budget. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
