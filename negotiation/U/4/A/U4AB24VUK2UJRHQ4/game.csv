"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I could consider $1,500,000.  This is a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is the very highest I could go.  It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price if you're interested.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
