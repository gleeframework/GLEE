(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $7500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, I would like to counter with a price of $7200 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on it while also considering your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $7,200 is closer to his goal, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. He's already demonstrated his willingness to pay less than Alice's initial offer, so she might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $7200 is closer, I'm still looking for a deal closer to $7000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and I am willing to consider a price of $7150 for the product. This is a bit higher than your last proposal, but still within our valuation range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he was hoping for a price closer to $7000, $7150 is a good deal. He's already demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has countered multiple times, so he likely won't get a much better price.  Buying from John for $8,000 is a less attractive option."
