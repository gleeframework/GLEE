Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, giving him some room to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if it seems like we won't be able to agree on a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give up the product for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm countering with $12,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows good faith and will encourage him to come up a bit more.  If he rejects, I'll consider selling to John, as I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and it seems we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, so I'll go ahead and sell to John. It's not the best outcome, but it ensures I get at least the minimum I'm comfortable with."
