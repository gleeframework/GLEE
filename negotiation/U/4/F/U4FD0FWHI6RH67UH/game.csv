"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that 150 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 130? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a little high for me.  How about $115? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 115 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at 125? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
