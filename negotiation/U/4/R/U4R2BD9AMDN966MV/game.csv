"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a price that allows for a substantial profit for you, while still providing me with a fair return on my investment. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $800,000.  Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
