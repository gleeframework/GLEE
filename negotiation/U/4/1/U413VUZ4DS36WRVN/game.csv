"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it still offers a good return for you. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is the maximum you can afford, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still more than I can manage. I'm sticking with my initial counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
