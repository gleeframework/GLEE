"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is the maximum you can afford, but I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a better price. There's still room for compromise before considering buying from John."

This is a significant reduction from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to me. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
