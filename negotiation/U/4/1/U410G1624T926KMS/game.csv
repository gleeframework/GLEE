"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that being said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
