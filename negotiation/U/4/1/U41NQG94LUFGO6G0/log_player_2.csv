"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than John's price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and Alice's value of $800,000. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to purchase from John as a last resort."
