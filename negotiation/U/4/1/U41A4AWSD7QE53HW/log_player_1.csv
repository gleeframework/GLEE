Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer to see if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should just sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a good profit. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and may entice Bob to accept, while still leaving room for potential further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is $25,000 more than what John would pay, and while I'd prefer more, it's a reasonable compromise and a quick sale.  I'm willing to accept it."
