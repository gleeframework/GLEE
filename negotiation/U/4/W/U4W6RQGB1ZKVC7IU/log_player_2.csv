Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's a much better price than what I could get elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000 and I can get the product for that price from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
