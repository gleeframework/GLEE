"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $5,000 is far too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it's a much better price than what I could get elsewhere.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  However, $7,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",8500.0,Alice,5,
