"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $8,500 is too low for me, and I think I can still get a better deal with Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $8,750? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll try to counter with a price that's closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob's offer of $8,800 is closer to my goal, but I've been negotiating with him for a while and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a higher price. John is a guaranteed sale at $8,000, and it's better to secure that than risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
