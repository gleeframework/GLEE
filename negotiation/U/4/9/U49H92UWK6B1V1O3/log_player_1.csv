Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $99. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to aim for a price higher than that. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $80.
* **Negotiation:** Offering the product at $99 leaves room for potential negotiation. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this price immediately, it sets a starting point.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** You can always fall back on selling to John for $100 if Bob rejects your offer. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you're prioritizing maximizing your profit. If you were more focused on simply making a sale quickly, offering a price closer to Bob's valuation might be more effective."
