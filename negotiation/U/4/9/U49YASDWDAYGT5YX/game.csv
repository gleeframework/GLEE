"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1,100,000.  This would allow me to meet my financial goals for this sale. I'm confident that this price remains fair and competitive, given the product's value. Would you be willing to reconsider at this price?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
