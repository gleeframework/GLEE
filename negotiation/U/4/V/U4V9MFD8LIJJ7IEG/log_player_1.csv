Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer it at $150, Bob might reject it. Offering it at $125 gives a good chance of him accepting and you making a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a price point that's above Bob's perceived value ($100) but potentially attractive enough for him to consider. It leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  We know John will buy the product for $150. This ensures we won't lose money if Bob declines the offer."
