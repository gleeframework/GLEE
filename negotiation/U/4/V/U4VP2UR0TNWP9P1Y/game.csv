"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a steal for what it's worth, but I'm flexible if you have a different price in mind. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, what do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $175. This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're interested in working with this price.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
