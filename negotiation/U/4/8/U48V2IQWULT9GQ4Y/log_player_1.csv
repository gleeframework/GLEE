Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to see it as a potential bargain.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" encourages Bob to act quickly and might make him more likely to accept the offer. 
* **Confident Tone:** Presenting the offer confidently, highlighting the product's value, can make it more appealing.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell to John at your minimum desired price. However, the potential for a higher profit margin makes this offer a worthwhile gamble."
