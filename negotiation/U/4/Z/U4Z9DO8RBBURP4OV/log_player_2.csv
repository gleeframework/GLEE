"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is still slightly above Alice's value of $100, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and within Bob's budget.  This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at 108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $108, which is still above her value of $100, but within Bob's budget of $120.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to get the product at a good price without risking further negotiations. It's a reasonable compromise."
