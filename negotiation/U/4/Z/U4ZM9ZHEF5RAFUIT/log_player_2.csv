"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'll sell it to you for $12500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her ($15,000), it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, making this the best option to save money."
