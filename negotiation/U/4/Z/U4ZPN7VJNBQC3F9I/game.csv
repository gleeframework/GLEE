"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think!",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $200. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $200 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we split the difference and I pay $140?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $180. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",180.0,Alice,5,
