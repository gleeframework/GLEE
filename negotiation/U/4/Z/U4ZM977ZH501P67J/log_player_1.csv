Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. However, I am still unable to meet you at a price higher than $10,000. Could we possibly find a middle ground?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
