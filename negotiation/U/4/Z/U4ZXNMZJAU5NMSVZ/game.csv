"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $130?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to get a fair deal here. While $130 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,4,
