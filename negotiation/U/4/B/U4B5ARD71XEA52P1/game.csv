"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only go up to $8,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints but $8,000 is significantly below its value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a fair offer considering the benefits you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is truly above $10,000. I can come down to $14,000, that's my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  I can't go higher than $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your need to sell.  Let's make this happen.",12000.0,Bob,6,
