"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,500,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, given its potential and the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can reach a deal within this range.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  This product has the potential to generate far more in returns.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This offer reflects its worth while still recognizing your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try $900,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the potential of the product while ensuring we both benefit from this transaction.  I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a compromise. How about $1,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us, considering the potential returns you'll gain from this unique product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued effort to find a compromise. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still beyond my reach.  I'm confident we can strike a deal at $950,000. This price reflects the product's potential while keeping me within my financial limits.  Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,6,
