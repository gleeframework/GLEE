Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

This offer is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's maximum price.  It gives me a good deal, while still giving Bob a chance to buy the product for less than he would pay John.  

If Bob rejects this offer, I will still be able to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a major risk by offering a lower price."
