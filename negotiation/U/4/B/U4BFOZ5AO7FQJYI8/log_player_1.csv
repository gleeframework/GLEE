Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $20,000.  I believe it's a worthwhile investment at this price, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with a price above your minimum ($15,000) allows room for negotiation. It also positions the product as potentially more valuable in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message hints at flexibility (""open to discussing""). This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere closer to his perceived value without feeling pressured.
* **Alternative Buyer as Leverage:** You don't explicitly mention John, but knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 provides you with a strong fallback position. This allows you to be more confident in your initial offer.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might reject any offer above $8,000. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still giving you the option to secure the sale with John."
