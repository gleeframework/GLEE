"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for a better price by negotiating with Alice, or at worst, you can buy it from John for $120."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. I'll offer you the product for $92.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, you're still better off continuing to negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get the product for closer to your target price of $85 or lower. If negotiations fail, you can always purchase from John for $120 as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  This is a good middle ground for us and ensures we can both come away satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $87.50 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $89. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd prefer to pay less, $89 is within your budget and a better price than what John is offering.  It's also a reasonable compromise given that Alice has made several concessions already.  There's a good chance that if you reject this offer, Alice might not be willing to go any lower, and you would end up paying $120 from John."
