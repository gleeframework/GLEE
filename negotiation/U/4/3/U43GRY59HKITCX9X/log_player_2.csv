# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.
