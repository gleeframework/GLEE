"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $9500. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit steep for me. I can do $8800, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8800 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a bit more than that. I can offer it to you for $9200. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $9200 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $9000, and that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer it to you for $9500 one last time. If you're still not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make one last offer, Alice. However, I'm still not willing to go above $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9500, which would be $9250. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you halfway, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9800. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",9800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I've already gone above my budget with my previous offers. I'm willing to meet you at $9500, which is the last price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,10,
