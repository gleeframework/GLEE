"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $110 is a better price than John's $120, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell."
