Round 2

{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** We're aiming for a significant price drop to make Alice more likely to negotiate. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer is below Alice's minimum value, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Time is on our side:** We have 10 rounds, so we can afford to be a bit aggressive in the early stages."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Pressure:** By offering the minimum acceptable price, we signal our willingness to close the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept.

* **Negotiations are getting tense.** Alice is showing less flexibility, but we're still willing to negotiate further.
* **Buying from John is a risk.** The longer we negotiate with Alice, the less time we have left to consider buying from John, and we don't want to be left with no options. 

We'll try one more counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to meet us halfway."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Offer:** This counteroffer is a midpoint between our previous offer and Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Final Negotiation:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation process and need to find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Risk Mitigation:** This offer keeps us within our budget while also showing Alice that we are serious about making a deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 7, and it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Alice.
* **Alice is not budging:**  Alice's offer is still too high, and she's not showing any willingness to compromise further.
* **John is a safe option:** Buying from John guarantees we get the product within our budget, even if it's not the most ideal price.

While we could continue negotiating with Alice, the likelihood of securing a better deal in the remaining rounds is low.  It's better to secure the product from John now and avoid the risk of running out of time."
