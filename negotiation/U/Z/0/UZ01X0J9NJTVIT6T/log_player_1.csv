Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $150 represents a 25% markup from your minimum acceptable price ($120). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By emphasizing that Bob has the first opportunity, you create a sense of value and urgency, potentially pushing him to accept a higher price. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always lower the price slightly, but remember your bottom line is $120."
