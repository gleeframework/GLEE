"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This tactic provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message frames the high price as reflecting the product's inherent value, not just my desire to maximize profit. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Assuring Bob that I'm open to discussion encourages him to counter-offer and keeps the negotiation moving.

My strategy is to start high and gradually decrease the price, but always remain above my minimum selling price of $1,500,000. I will carefully analyze Bob's counteroffers to understand his willingness to pay and adjust my approach accordingly. I am also keeping the option of John open if the negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above his perceived value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Apparent):** I've significantly reduced my price from the initial offer,  signaling a willingness to compromise. This makes my position appear more reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,900,000 counteroffer is still well above my minimum and leaves me space for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's potential to benefit Bob, reminding him of the value he gains from this deal.

I am maintaining a firm stance above my minimum while encouraging continued negotiation. By making a significant price reduction, I aim to bring Bob closer to my desired selling price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,500,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit, and it's a better outcome than selling to John for my minimum price."
