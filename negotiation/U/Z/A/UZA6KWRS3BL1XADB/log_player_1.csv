Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and its potential is truly remarkable.  I'm asking for $1,750,000.  Given its value, I'm confident this is a fair offer."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strategic Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically aims to justify the high price, even if it's slightly above his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it's not so outrageous that it would immediately scare Bob away.  It opens the door for him to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially meet in the middle and still exceed your minimum selling price."
