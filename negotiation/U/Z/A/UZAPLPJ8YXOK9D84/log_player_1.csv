Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a safety net.  Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially earn a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. Bob might be willing to pay a premium for exclusivity and early access.
* **Clear and Confident Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and your willingness to make a deal."
