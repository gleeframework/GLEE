"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price point reflects the value it offers while still being a favorable deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm aiming for a price that acknowledges the true value of what I'm offering.  How about we land at $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,8,
