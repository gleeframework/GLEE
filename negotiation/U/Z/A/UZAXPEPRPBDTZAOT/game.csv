"Alice, your product looks promising, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your concerns.  This price still allows for a mutually beneficial deal, and I believe we can both benefit from this partnership.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my maximum.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
