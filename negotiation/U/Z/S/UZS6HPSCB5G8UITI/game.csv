"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value is significant, and I'm confident it can transform your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this offer reflects the true worth of what's on the table.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns better with my financial situation while still recognizing the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer, but I need to see a more substantial commitment from your end. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
