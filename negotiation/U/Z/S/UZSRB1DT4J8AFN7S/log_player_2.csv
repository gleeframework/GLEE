"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. It's something that could be incredibly beneficial to your business, but I understand its worth might be difficult to assess without further information. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm offering it to you for $900000. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. Accepting her offer saves you $600,000 compared to buying from John.  Even if the product's true value is a bit lower than $900,000, the potential savings make it a worthwhile purchase."
