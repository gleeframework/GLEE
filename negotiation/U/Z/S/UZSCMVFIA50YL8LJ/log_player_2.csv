Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm proposing a price of $1025000. This is a reasonable compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to my preferred price range.  Considering that buying from John would cost me significantly more, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best option at this point. I'm saving a substantial amount compared to John's price, and the negotiation process has shown Alice is willing to be flexible."
