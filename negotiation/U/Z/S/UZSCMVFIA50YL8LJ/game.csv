"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its worth. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm proposing a price of $1025000. This is a reasonable compromise that should be acceptable to both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
