"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  Let's find a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, the gap between our valuations is still significant. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that. Let's bridge this gap. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
