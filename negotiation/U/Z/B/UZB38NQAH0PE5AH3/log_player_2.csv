Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,000 for the product. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice seems pretty firm on a $13,000 price, and you're not likely to get her lower. You have a guaranteed option with John for $12,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation for a potential saving of just $1,000."
