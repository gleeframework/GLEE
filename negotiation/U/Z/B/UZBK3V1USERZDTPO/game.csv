"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Considering the value you mentioned, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise and allows for potential profit for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you've suggested doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a significant reduction and represents my strong desire to see this deal through with you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still above my budget.  I understand the product has value, but I'm limited to $1,400,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
