Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $6,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

Alice is coming down in price, and $6,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's a good deal compared to John's $8,000 price.  I'll accept her offer."
