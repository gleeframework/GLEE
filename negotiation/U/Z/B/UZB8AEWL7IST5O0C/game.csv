"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a fair price, it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still aiming to keep my expenses within $10,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between, perhaps at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
