"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd like to offer you. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. How about $150?  Let me know your thoughts!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $135 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. How about we split the difference at $142.50?  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.",142.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider that?,130.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $130 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle at $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $130, which would be $132.50. Can you consider that?",132.5,Bob,6,
