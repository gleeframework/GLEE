Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000 to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,125,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount to $1,175,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly holding firm to her minimum price of $1,200,000. While we could continue negotiating, she's shown a willingness to compromise, and this offer is a reasonable saving.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal in the remaining rounds."
