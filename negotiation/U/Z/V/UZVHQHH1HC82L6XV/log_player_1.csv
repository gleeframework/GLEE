Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a high offer, but it's a calculated risk. Here's the reasoning:

* **Maximize potential gain:**  Aiming for $1,500,000 gives me a significant profit over my minimum acceptable value.
* **Understand John's role:** John's willingness to pay $1,000,000 acts as a safety net. If Bob rejects, I still get a good price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer.  By setting a higher initial price, I have more flexibility to negotiate downward if necessary. 

Ultimately, this offer is a balance between maximizing potential profit and minimizing risk."
