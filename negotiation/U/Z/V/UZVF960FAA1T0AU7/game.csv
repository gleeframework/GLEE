"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than $850,000 to make it worth my while. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see you're serious about the deal. However, I still need to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925,000 and my target, which is $1,050,000. How about we aim for $1,037,500?",1037500.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to move closer to my target. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1,025,000? That's the best I can do at this point.",1025000.0,Alice,7,,
