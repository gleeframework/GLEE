{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum ($150). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** $130 is a price that's potentially agreeable to both of us.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to counteroffers:** My message indicates that I'm open to negotiating, which encourages Bob to participate. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is both beneficial to me and acceptable to Bob, while also leaving room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product for me. I'm going to counteroffer with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's position:** I start by acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $120 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate.
* **Positive framing:** I use positive language and a friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Leave the door open:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for considering my budget, Alice. I really like the product, but I can't go above $110. Could you possibly meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's counteroffer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $150 I can get from John. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  

I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence!  I'm really close to my limit here. How about we settle on $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to call it a day. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence and showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway.
* **Final offer (almost):**  $115 is a compromise that's just above my minimum acceptable price, but still below what I can get from John. 
* **Time for a decision:**  I'm presenting this as a final offer, hoping to close the deal and avoid further negotiation. 
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language and a friendly tone to encourage Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while also minimizing the risk of further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident I can sell to John for a better price."
