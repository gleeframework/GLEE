Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150), but lower than what I believe it could be worth to Bob ($80). This allows some room for negotiation and might encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to sell the product for less than what it's worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $140. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it shows that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but it still leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. Although Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling for less than I'm comfortable with.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, so it's the safest and most lucrative option at this point."
