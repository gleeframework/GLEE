Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $650,000 is tempting, I'm looking to secure a price closer to $700,000. This would represent a fair deal for both of us, given the product's value.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand your position, $675,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $690,000, which is a fair middle ground.  This allows us both to save some money while securing a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
