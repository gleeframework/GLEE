Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 provides a safety net.  
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially still exceeding the $150 John offers.
* **Appeal to Value:** The message frames the price as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob."
