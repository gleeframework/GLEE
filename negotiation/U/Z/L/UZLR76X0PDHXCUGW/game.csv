"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle on this one.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $12750. Let's split the difference and try $13125.  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13125.0,Alice,5,
