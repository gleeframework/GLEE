"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to make the offer seem appealing and build rapport.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to entice Bob.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:**  A higher starting price gives me more room to negotiate.
* **Avoid Immediate Rejection:**  The price is within Bob's potential value range, reducing the risk of an immediate rejection. 
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can still negotiate down to a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob is interested, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Even though Bob is on a tight budget, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a backup option with John who's willing to pay my minimum price. This provides me with leverage and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, but still below John's offer, to try and bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle on this one."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but not by too much. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $13,500 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, signaling a desire to find a mutually acceptable solution.
* **Benefit Emphasis:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" aspect for both of us to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Value:**  Stay above my minimum acceptable price while creating a bridge for negotiation.
* **Induce Acceptance:** The counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, making it more attractive.
* **Show Flexibility:**  Demonstrating willingness to compromise increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $12750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $12,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Significant Gap:** There's still a significant gap between our offers, and I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.
* **Leverage with John:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, giving me the leverage to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum. This will demonstrate a willingness to compromise while maintaining a fair price for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,750. Let's split the difference and try $13,125.  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($13,500) and Bob's offer ($12,750), demonstrating a desire to meet in the middle.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $13,125 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the Gap:**  It narrows the gap between our offers, making it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By splitting the difference, I am demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Value:**  I am still receiving a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $13000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is just $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $14,000.  While I'd prefer more, it's a decent price considering the limited time remaining.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** We're in round 6, and each round increases the risk of Bob getting frustrated and backing out.  
* **Time is Money:**  Each round I spend negotiating is an opportunity cost, as I could be selling to John for $15,000.
* **No Guarantee:**  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in future rounds.  

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the best compromise given the circumstances.  It's a quick and reasonably profitable deal."
