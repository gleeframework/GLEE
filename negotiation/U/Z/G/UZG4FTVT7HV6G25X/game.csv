"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. It's a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make a more reasonable offer.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I'll counter with $7500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $6000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be able to afford it.",6000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. However, I need to make a profit, so I'll meet you at $6500, but I'll throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $6475. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",6475.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a lower offer of $6000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be able to afford it. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",6000.0,Bob,6,
