Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm initially offering it for $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a high price.
* **Backup Plan:** I have the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), ensuring I won't settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my initial ask.  I believe there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer and providing a counter-offer keeps the conversation going and allows me to guide the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the value of this product to you is substantial.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to drop my price drastically. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,400,000, I'm meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer and his counter-offer, which is often seen as a fair negotiation tactic. 
* **Maintaining Profitability:** This price point still allows me to earn a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is getting close to my bottom line. Further haggling might not yield a significantly better result and could risk losing the sale.

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting this offer still provides a substantial profit margin above my minimum ($1,200,000). 

* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now prevents the negotiation from dragging on, allowing me to move on to other potential opportunities."
