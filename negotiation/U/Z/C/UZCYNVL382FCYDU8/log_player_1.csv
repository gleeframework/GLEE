"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is well above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm positive and enthusiastic, highlighting the potential value for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* I want to get as much as possible from Bob, while also keeping the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations fall apart. 
* This first offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation, where I can adjust my price based on Bob's counteroffers and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Offer:** While $900,000 is a significant improvement over Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to accept it this early in the negotiation. 
* **Strategy:** I want to push for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal. I have ten rounds, so I can afford to be a little more aggressive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This allows you a good margin for your business, while still giving me a fair price for my product.  Let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing the benefits for both of us. 
* **Strategy:** I want to keep the pressure on Bob to accept a price closer to my goal. I'm making it clear that I'm open to a deal but won't accept anything too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Offer:**  While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum goal, it's still not enough.  I want to see if I can push Bob even further.
* **Strategy:** I believe I can still secure a better price. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and try to close the gap. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,000,000 yet, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's try $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. We're almost there, let's get this done!"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm raising the offer slightly to $1,025,000, making a small concession while still staying above my minimum goal of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the benefits for both of us, highlighting the near-finality of the deal. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and a feeling that we are close to an agreement.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is a strategic move to test Bob's willingness to close the deal. I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower, but I'm open to a compromise. If Bob rejects this, I'll likely have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any higher. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  Bob's offer of $990,000 is still below my minimum target of $1,000,000.  While I'm close to my goal, I'm not willing to risk losing more time and potentially getting a worse deal. 
* **Strategy:** With only four rounds remaining, I'm starting to run out of time. I've made a good effort to negotiate with Bob, but I'm confident I can secure my minimum price with John.  Selling to John now minimizes the risk of getting a lower offer from Bob and also avoids further negotiation rounds."
