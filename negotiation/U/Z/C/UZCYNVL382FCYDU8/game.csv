"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This allows you a good margin for your business, while still giving me a fair price for my product.  Let's get this done!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's try $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. We're almost there, let's get this done!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $990,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any higher. I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
