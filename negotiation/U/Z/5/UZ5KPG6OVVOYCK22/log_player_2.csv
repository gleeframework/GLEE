"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This offer takes into account the worth you see in the product and aims to ensure a fair transaction for both parties. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $95 is still more than you're willing to pay. Since you can buy it from John for $100, it's better to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
