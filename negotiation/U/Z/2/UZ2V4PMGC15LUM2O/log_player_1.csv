Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth significantly more than the asking price. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase. This justifies the higher price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The high initial price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It shows you value the product while acknowledging he might want to discuss the price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough that Bob doesn't immediately dismiss it."
