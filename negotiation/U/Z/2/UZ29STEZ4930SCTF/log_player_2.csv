"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, as the product is worth $12,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to accept $13,000 for the product?  I believe this price is fair, considering the value to me and your potential profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to make a reasonable profit on this sale. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This price still reflects the value the product holds for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500. This is a good deal for Bob, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further, there's also the risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
