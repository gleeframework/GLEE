"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's valuation, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. I'm happy to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can work something out!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is a great deal, and it's a fair price for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can potentially still negotiate a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, and Bob can try to push Alice further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,750?  This is a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to compromise a bit, but I need to be closer to my desired price. Let's split the difference - $10,875. This is a fair price that's mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice has come down significantly, Bob is only $875 away from his target price of $10,000. He can likely get closer to that target with another counteroffer and still have time to go to John if he needs to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm hoping we can find a way to bridge the gap.  How about $10,850?  This is a fair compromise that's within both of our price ranges.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left. Alice has come down to $10,850, which is only $850 more than what Bob can get from John.  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and the risk of running out of rounds and being stuck with a higher price is too high.  Therefore, Bob should cut his losses and buy from John, guaranteeing the lowest price and securing the product."
