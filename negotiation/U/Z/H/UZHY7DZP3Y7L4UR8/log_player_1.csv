"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm sure we can reach a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and a mutually beneficial outcome.  I've also highlighted the value Bob would get from the product to encourage him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the most I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my minimum of $8,000. There's still a lot of room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for that price just yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $9,000 simply doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is a fair compromise and meets my minimum requirements. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
