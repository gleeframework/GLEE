"Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $137.50?  That's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $137.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $115.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another seller.",115.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $118.  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller.",118.0,Bob,6,
