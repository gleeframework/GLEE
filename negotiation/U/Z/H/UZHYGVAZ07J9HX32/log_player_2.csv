"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but it's a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $137.50?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $137.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $115.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another seller."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's still above my minimum, but it shows that I'm serious about making this deal work.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's getting closer, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You have a few rounds left and can leverage the fact that John is offering the product for $100 as leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $118.  I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 118}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $121.50?  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget. You only have 3 rounds left, and it's unlikely that you'll be able to negotiate a price lower than $121.50. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John at $100."
