Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,750. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the value you place on the product.

```

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,250.  At this point, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price than John's offer of $15,000. It's time to cut losses and buy from John."
