Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still end up with a price you're happy with.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (even if it's just perceived value) can make it more palatable to the buyer. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By saying ""What do you think?"", we invite Bob to counter-offer, opening up the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a single round of negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, we move directly to John, who represents our guaranteed minimum.
* We don't want to scare Bob off with an outrageous price.  The $18,000 is a significant markup but still within the realm of possibility depending on the nature of the product."
