Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I make a profit significantly above my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my desired price, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,800,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but a step closer to my initial asking price, showing that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob hasn't budged from his previous offer, and while I'd prefer a higher price, $1,600,000 is still a good deal. I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
