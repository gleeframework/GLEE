"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,800,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable figure?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice won't budge below $1,200,000, and John is offering the product at that exact price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can get your maximum price from John without further hassle."
