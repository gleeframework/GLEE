"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we bring it down to a more reasonable figure?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
