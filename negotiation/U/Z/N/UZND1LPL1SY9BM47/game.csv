"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. Can you consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
