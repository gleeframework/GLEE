"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my price range.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $18,000 is reflecting the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair compromise, and it gets us both closer to a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $12,000 is less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept it if we can close the deal today.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
