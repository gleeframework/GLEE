Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, knowing it's a bit more than what Bob values the product at. This gives me room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:** While I want to maximize my profit, I'm not being unreasonable. $10,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he'll be saving $2,000.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message emphasizes my willingness to work with Bob, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth pursuing further. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $12,000 if I believe I'm not getting a good enough deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering the value I'm getting.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to lose so much money.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  There's still room to find a price that works for both of us.
* **Exploring other options:**  I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, but I'll also keep John in mind as a potential buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a significant discount for you. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping the price from $10,000 to $9,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my financial interests.
* **Finality:** I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to add pressure and incentivize Bob to accept. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll gain from the product, hoping to sway him towards accepting my offer.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
