"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its worth, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 might have been a bit ambitious, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's $10,000 limit. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his budget. There are still rounds available, so there's room to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $13,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still over his $10,000 limit.  Since Alice has stated this is her ""final offer,"" there's a high chance further negotiation won't yield a lower price. Given that Bob can buy the product from John for $10,000, it's the most logical choice at this point.  This secures the product at Bob's desired price without risking further negotiation that could potentially fail."
