"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its worth, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $18,000 might have been a bit ambitious, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  If you're serious about selling, this is the best I can do.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
