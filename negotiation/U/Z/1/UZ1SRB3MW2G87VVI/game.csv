"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,700,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
