# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. It's not a good deal. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $82? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:

``` 
 
You're still trying to save as much money as possible. While $82 is closer to your budget, you can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 78}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $80. How about we meet at $79? It's a small concession, but I'm willing to make it to get the deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $79, which is only $1 more than what the product is worth to you.  While you'd love to pay less, accepting this offer means you get the product for a good price and avoid any further negotiation."
