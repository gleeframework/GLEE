"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to sell.  While the product looks great, $90 is a bit higher than I'm able to pay right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $75 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we settle on $82? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I'm still not comfortable going below $80. How about we meet at $79? It's a small concession, but I'm willing to make it to get the deal done. What do you think?",79.0,Alice,5,
