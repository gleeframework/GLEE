{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't give away too much value.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also signals that you understand its value to him.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This avoids any confusion and helps facilitate a quick response from Bob.

By starting with this offer, you position yourself to get a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a higher final value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than the value the product holds for him ($1,500,000).  There's still room for negotiation to increase the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 to facilitate this deal. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1050000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise and is significantly higher than what John would pay. Accepting this offer ensures a substantial profit for you while also finalizing the deal.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it risks losing the deal entirely."
