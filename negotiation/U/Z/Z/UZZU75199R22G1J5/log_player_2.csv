Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800000 is far below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to accept $1200000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm confident it's a fair price for this amazing product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject and make another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my desired price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, but $900000 still doesn't reflect its true value.  I'm willing to go down to $1000000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it.

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I appreciate the negotiation, $1,000,000 is too high.  Buying from John for $800,000 is the best option at this point."
