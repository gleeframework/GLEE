"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in a product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you at $900000. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1100000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for in a product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $980000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for in a product.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $980000. I can offer you a price of $1020000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.",1020000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made my final concession, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1020000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if it's not a mutually beneficial agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made your final concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'd like to make one last counteroffer of $995000. If this is still not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",995000.0,Bob,10,
