Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $6,900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer twice now. There's a risk she'll stand firm, and I'd end up paying John's $10,000 price. Accepting $6,900 secures a significant discount and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
