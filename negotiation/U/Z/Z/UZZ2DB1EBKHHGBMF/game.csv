"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm interested in your product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to buy it for $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is my lowest price. Let's try to make this work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $95 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $100 is my final offer. If you accept, we have a deal. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",100.0,Alice,5,
