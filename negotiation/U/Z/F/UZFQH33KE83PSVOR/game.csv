"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $850000 is above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to me is no less than $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a new price of $825000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $800000.  This is my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
