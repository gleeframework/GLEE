"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and allows you a healthy profit margin.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if a better price can be reached."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This still gives you a significant profit and keeps the deal beneficial for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still over his limit. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to counteroffer again before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I value your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,000,000, as this would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a reluctance to budge significantly from her price point, even after several rounds of negotiation.  While $1,000,000 is close to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his maximum.  It's better for Bob to secure the product from John for a price he's comfortable with, rather than risk further negotiation that may not yield a satisfactory outcome."
