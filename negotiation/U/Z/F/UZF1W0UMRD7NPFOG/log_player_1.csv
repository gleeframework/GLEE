Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $140 offers a good profit margin above Bob's perceived value ($100) while staying attractive compared to him finding a similar product elsewhere. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a single offer, setting it slightly below your absolute minimum leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested.
