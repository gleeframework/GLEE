"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm confident this product can bring you even greater returns. How about we settle at $1,050,000? It's a price that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we settle at $1,025,000? I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
