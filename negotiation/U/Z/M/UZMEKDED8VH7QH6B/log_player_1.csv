Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below that ($11,500) gives Bob a perceived deal while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob directly avoids the potential delay of going to John. This faster sale has its own value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a small window for Bob to negotiate a slightly higher price if he's highly motivated. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  If Alice believes Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start with a slightly higher price, leaving more room for potential concessions.
* **Relationship Value:** If Alice values a future relationship with Bob, she might offer a more generous price to foster goodwill."
