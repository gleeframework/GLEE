"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. 

* **Alice's offer:** $11,500
* **John's offer:** $12,000
* **Bob's maximum:** $12,000

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can wait to see if Alice lowers her price or if he can find an even better deal."
