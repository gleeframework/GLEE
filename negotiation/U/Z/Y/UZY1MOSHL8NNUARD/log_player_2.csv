"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $12,000 to make it work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a bold approach here, aiming for a significant price reduction. This counteroffer demonstrates his serious interest in the product while showing he's willing to negotiate. It sets a clear expectation for the next round, giving Alice a chance to either accept or counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to Bob's target price, there is still room for further negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price. He has 7 more rounds left, so he can afford to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be assertive while remaining flexible. He's making a reasonable counteroffer by proposing a compromise that's closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows good faith while still aiming for a price that fits his budget."
