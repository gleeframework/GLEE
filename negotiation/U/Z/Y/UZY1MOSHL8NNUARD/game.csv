"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $12,000 to make it work.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  Let's make this deal happen.",12500.0,Bob,4,
