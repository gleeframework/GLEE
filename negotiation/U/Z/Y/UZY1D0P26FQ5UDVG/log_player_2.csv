You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. It's always better to try to negotiate with Alice first. If that fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to gauge her willingness to negotiate. This initial offer is still within my budget and gives us a starting point for a potential bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's worth trying to push for a better price. If Alice refuses to go lower, I'll still have the option to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but still trying to stay within my budget.  A $50,000 increase might be enough to incentivize Alice to accept, but if not, I'll have the option of purchasing from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget, and it's only $50,000 more than what John is selling it for.  It's worth accepting this offer, especially since we've already been through multiple rounds of negotiation. There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
