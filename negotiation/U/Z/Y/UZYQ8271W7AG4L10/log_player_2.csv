Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product from John for $8,000, so Alice's offer is not a good deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my bottom line.  It's a fair price for a product that's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested.
