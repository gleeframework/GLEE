"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond this asking price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I think it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than Alice's initial price ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially stay well below my $8,000 limit.
* **Polite and Positive:** The message remains polite and acknowledges the value of the product, even while suggesting a much lower price.  This helps maintain a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but she's still significantly above my $8,000 limit. I'll reject this offer to signal that I'm serious about a lower price and see if she's willing to negotiate further.  I'm getting closer to John's price, so I need to be ready to walk away if Alice doesn't budge enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. I appreciate the movement on price, but $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,500?  That would work much better for my budget."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump, But Still Room:** I increased my offer significantly from $6,000 to $7,500.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but it's still safely below both her offer and my $8,000 maximum.
* **Budget Focus:** I'm emphasizing my budget limitations again to reinforce why I can't meet her current price.
* **Direct and Clear:** The counteroffer is straightforward, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward efficiently."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the continued conversation.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident in the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000, and I'm not willing to pay more than $8,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer. While I might have been able to squeeze a slightly better deal out of Alice, the potential savings aren't worth the risk of her rejecting further offers and losing out on the product entirely."
