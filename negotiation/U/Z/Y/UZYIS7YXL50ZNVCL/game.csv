"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I think it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. How about $10,500?  This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for being willing to negotiate. I appreciate the movement on price, but $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $7,500?  That would work much better for my budget.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the continued conversation.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident in the value this product offers. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,5,
