"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product might be worth even more than Bob initially thought.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to plant seeds of higher worth in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving John as leverage:** While I'm willing to walk away from Bob and take John's offer, it's my backup plan.  My focus is to maximize profit, and securing a deal above $1,500,000 with Bob is the priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,150,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's showing interest, accepting at $1,150,000 would be a substantial loss.  It's time to counter and guide the negotiation towards a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product. Let's find a more agreeable middle ground. How about $1,900,000?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by acknowledging his counteroffer to show I'm open to negotiation.
* **Holding firm:**  While I'm lowering my price, I'm still significantly above his offer, reinforcing that my initial valuation wasn't arbitrary. 
* **New middle ground:** $1,900,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer but still provides a substantial profit margin. This encourages Bob to engage further while keeping the deal above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,900,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above the minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Stronger negotiating position:** Accepting this offer puts me in a stronger position if I decide to negotiate further. Bob has now crossed his perceived value threshold, indicating serious interest. 
* **Time consideration:** We're four rounds in. While I have time, securing a deal sooner rather than later reduces risk and uncertainty."
