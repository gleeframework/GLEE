"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep.  I'm willing to pay $100. What do you say?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $150.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little high on $110, though. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I think that's fair to both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
