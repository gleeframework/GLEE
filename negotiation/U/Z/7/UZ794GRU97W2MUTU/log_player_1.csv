"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's value, but not so high as to immediately make him walk away. I want to see if I can get a better price than the $10,000 John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is below my minimum value of $10,000, and I'm hoping I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll see if I can push him a little higher with my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be appealing to Bob as he's already shown a willingness to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,500 is a good price for me, as it's higher than my minimum value and higher than what John is offering. There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds, so I'll take this deal."
