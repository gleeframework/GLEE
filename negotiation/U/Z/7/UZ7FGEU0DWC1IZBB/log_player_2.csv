Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum requirement. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, and I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This still allows you a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.
