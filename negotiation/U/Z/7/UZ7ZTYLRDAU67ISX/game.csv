"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's worth a lot more to me, so this is a great deal for you! Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to close this deal, it's a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
