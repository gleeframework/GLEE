"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a lower price or move on to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product holds a higher value for me. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my willingness to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget.  I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000.  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating or move on to John's offer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects a substantial compromise from my initial offer and would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, the value of this product to me remains significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000, which is my final offer. This represents a substantial concession on my part. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the most financially sensible option."
