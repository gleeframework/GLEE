"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product holds a higher value for me. I could consider coming down to $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This price reflects a substantial compromise from my initial offer and would be a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, the value of this product to me remains significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000, which is my final offer. This represents a substantial concession on my part.",950000.0,Alice,5,
