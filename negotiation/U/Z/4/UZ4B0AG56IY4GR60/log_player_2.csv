"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,150,000. I believe it presents significant value, and this price reflects its worth in the current market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to save more money by counter-offering."

This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's still not within Bob's ideal range.  Bob is willing to go up to $1,050,000, but Alice is offering $1,100,000. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should continue to try and get a better price."
