"I understand you're working with a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $12,000. How about $10,750?",10750.0,Alice,5,
