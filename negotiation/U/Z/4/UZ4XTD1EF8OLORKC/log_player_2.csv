"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a considerable savings for you and a good deal for me.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
