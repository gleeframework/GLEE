"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this valuable product for a price significantly lower than its true worth.  I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, so I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This represents a considerable savings for you and a good deal for me.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested party willing to pay full price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
