"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also trying to push for a lower price. $105 is a reasonable counteroffer, considering Alice's value is $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the best possible price. While $110 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to push for a lower price.  He has time and rounds left, so there's no need to rush into accepting the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $107.50. That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his last offer and Alice's offer. $107.50 is a reasonable compromise that shows he is serious about buying the product, but still trying to save money. It also leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
