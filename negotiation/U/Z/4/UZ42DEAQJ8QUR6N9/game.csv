"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $107.50. That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",107.5,Bob,4,
