Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down slightly, you'll still make more than selling to John directly.
* **Creating a Sense of Value:** By starting high, you emphasize the perceived value of the product."
