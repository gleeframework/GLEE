Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, given my budget constraints. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $11,000 is still above my target price of $15,000. I have more negotiation rounds left and can continue to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. Given our previous discussions, I believe $10,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product and our ongoing discussion, I am willing to accept $10,750 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,750. While this is still above my initial goal of $15,000, it's a significant improvement from her previous offers and only slightly over my last counteroffer. Accepting now secures a deal at a reasonable price, especially considering I've already used 5 rounds and have limited negotiating time left."
