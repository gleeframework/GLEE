"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to sell the product, $9,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my initial counteroffer. Can we try $10250? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $10,250 isn't ideal, it's getting closer to what I need, and it's a fair compromise from Bob. Accepting this offer is the best course of action at this point."
