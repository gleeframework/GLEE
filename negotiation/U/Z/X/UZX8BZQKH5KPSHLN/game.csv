"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. Would you consider $900,000? This would be a significant discount for you, and it's the absolute highest I can go right now.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on this, but I'm still not able to go that high. Would you consider $950,000? This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're making a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
