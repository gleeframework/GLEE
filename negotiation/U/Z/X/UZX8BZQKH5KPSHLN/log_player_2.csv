# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?

$1,200,000 is too high. I need to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,000,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget. I need to see if we can get closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but I'm still not quite there. Would you consider $900,000? This would be a significant discount for you, and it's the absolute highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,050,000 is still too high. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price, but if it doesn't work, I'll consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on this, but I'm still not able to go that high. Would you consider $950,000? This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're making a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I think it's time to cut my losses and buy from John. The price from Alice keeps creeping up, and I'm not confident we'll reach an agreement that's within my budget. While buying from John isn't ideal, it's the best option to ensure I get the product without going significantly over my limit."
