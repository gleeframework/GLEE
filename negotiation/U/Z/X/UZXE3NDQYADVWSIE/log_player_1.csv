``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  This also gives me a good profit margin but keeps the deal attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum,  I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm concerned we're going to go back and forth for a while. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
