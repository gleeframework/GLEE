"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $100, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was really hoping to get it for a bit cheaper. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go below $100, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so I'll offer you $95. It's the best I can do.",95.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go below $100, Bob. I think $92 is still a bit too low considering the product's value. I'll meet you halfway between $92 and $100, so I'll offer you $96. It's my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",96.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to go below $100, Bob. I think $94 is still a bit too low considering the product's value. I'll make one final offer, I'll meet you halfway between $94 and $100, so I'll offer you $97. This is my last offer, I'm not willing to go any lower.",97.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $97. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",95.0,Bob,10,
