"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of your product, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 doesn't reflect that. I could consider letting it go for $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
