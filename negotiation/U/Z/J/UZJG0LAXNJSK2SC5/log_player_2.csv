Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice knows the product is worth $10,000 to you. While getting it for $10,000 would be ideal, she's unlikely to go that low. Accepting her offer of $12,000 saves you $2,000 compared to John's price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
