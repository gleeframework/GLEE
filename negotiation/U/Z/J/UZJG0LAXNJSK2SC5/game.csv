"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but I have to make a living too. I can see you're a serious buyer, so I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  I could make a deal at $10,000.  This is a fair offer, considering it's a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,,
