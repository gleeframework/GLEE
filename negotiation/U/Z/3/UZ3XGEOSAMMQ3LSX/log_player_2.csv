"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $180 is too high, and he can get the same product from John for $120. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $140? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I could come down to $160, which I feel is still a very competitive price for this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $160 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still get the product for $120 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150. If you're willing to meet me in the middle, I'll take it."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
