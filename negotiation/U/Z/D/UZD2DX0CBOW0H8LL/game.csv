"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is unfortunately a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to offer $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both know this product holds.  I really hope we can reach an agreement here.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
