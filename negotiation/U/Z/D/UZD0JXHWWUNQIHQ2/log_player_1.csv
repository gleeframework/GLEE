Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $175, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, highlighting the product's value and leaving room for Bob to counter. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Keep the negotiation open:**  A friendly tone encourages further discussion and potential counteroffers.
* **Have a backup option:**  If Bob doesn't accept my offer, I can always sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering. That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's not worth it for me to accept such a low offer. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I can try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer ($175) and Bob's offer ($80). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's perspective.  This keeps the communication open and friendly. 

By offering a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiation going with the goal of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $80 is low, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's the closest we've gotten so far.  I've already rejected Bob's low offer of $80 and countered with $125, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  

* **Risk:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counter again, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with only the $150 offer from John. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting $100 means missing out on the potential to get closer to my desired price, but it also guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of losing Bob entirely.

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is the most practical decision, balancing the need for profit with the potential downsides of continued negotiation."
