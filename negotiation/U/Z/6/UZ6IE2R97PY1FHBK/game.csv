"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you've placed on the product.  While I see the benefits, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm at $875,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering both our positions.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $912,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and my initial offer of $900,000.",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $912,500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $893,750.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on. ",893750.0,Bob,6,
