"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $900,000.  There's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer.** This gives you the opportunity to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While it's moved closer to your desired price, it's still above what you're comfortable paying.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  By rejecting, you can make another counteroffer and see if you can get Alice to come down further."
