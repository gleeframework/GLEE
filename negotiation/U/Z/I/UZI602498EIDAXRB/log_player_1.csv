"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,800,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with an offer significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message uses positive language (""excited,"" ""valuable,"" ""potential"") to frame the negotiation in a collaborative and optimistic light.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I invite Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Is that something we can work with? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good offer, I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates interest, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of securing a higher price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 is my fallback option, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is lower than I'd like.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by recognizing Bob's offer to show I'm taking his proposal seriously.
* **Firm but Flexible:** I stand firm that $1,400,000 is too low but signal flexibility by saying I'm ""willing to come down a bit.""
* **Compromise:** By proposing $1,600,000, I'm offering a compromise that's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,600,000. How about we meet at $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. $1,500,000 is a strong profit, exceeding my minimum price by $300,000. While I could push for more, there's a risk of Bob walking away if I keep pushing. It's better to secure a favorable deal now rather than risk losing the sale entirely."
