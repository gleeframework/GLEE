"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better price. Buying from John immediately would cost you a lot more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since my maximum budget is $1,000,000, I'm starting with the highest price I'm willing to pay. This is a bold counteroffer, but it establishes my limit and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be a more expensive choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's still asking for more than I'm comfortable with. This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway. It shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price of $1,000,000. Buying from John at this point would be more expensive and wouldn't allow me to potentially save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm still interested in buying. However, I'm keeping it below $1,500,000 because I'm trying to meet Alice halfway.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing her by offering too low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to accept it.  We've been negotiating for a while, and I think there's still room for Alice to come down further.  There are only a few rounds left, so I need to be strategic to get the best price possible. Buying from John would be more expensive, and I'm determined to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about making a deal. $1,300,000 is a reasonable compromise, meeting her halfway from her last offer.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I want to demonstrate my willingness to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still a bit high.  With only one round left, I want to see if I can push for a lower price.  Buying from John would be a safer option, but I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm increasing my price slightly to show Alice I'm serious about buying but still within my budget.  We're down to the wire, so I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept.  If she rejects this, I'll be forced to buy from John, which is not my ideal outcome."
