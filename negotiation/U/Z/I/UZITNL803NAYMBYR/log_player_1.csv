"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a good starting point that's higher than my minimum but not too outrageous. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet, as I feel there's still room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm lowering my price to $120. This is still above my minimum, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, and that this offer is a good value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $90 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I continue to reject offers, I might not be able to secure a deal with Bob.  I'm also considering the risk of losing time and ultimately having to sell to John for $100."
