"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can come to an agreement closer to $8000. Would you consider this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $11500? This would allow you to get a great deal and me to still make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while also staying within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise, Alice. Considering our previous negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair solution for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
