"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $100?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $95 is still a bit too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $97.50, which would be $93.75. Would you be willing to consider that?",93.75,Bob,6,
