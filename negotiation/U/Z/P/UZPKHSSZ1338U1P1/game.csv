"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm still confident that my initial offer of $9,000 is a fair price for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,
