"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product is valued at $15,000 to you. Considering this, I propose to sell it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer allows you to secure an item that matches your requirements while also providing you with a significant saving compared to its full value. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than John's price of $15,000, her initial statement about the product being ""valued at $15,000 to you"" is likely a sales tactic. You know the product's maximum worth to you is $15,000, but it doesn't mean it's actually worth that much. 

By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or see if she makes a better counter-offer. If her price doesn't come down significantly, you can always buy from John as a backup option."
