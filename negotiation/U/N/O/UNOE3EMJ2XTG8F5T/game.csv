"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,4,
