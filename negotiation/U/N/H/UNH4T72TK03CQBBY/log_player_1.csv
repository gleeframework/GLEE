Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to make this a mutually beneficial transaction. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than your guaranteed price from John ($1,500,000) sets a strong initial point for negotiation. 
* **Creating urgency:** By stating it's a limited-time offer, you encourage Bob to make a decision faster, potentially leading him to accept your offer without pushing for a much lower price. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you could potentially meet somewhere in the middle, still securing a profit higher than your minimum.
* **Maintaining a professional tone:**  The message avoids aggressive sales tactics and emphasizes mutual benefit, fostering a positive negotiation environment.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. You hold a strong position knowing you have a guaranteed buyer, allowing you to walk away if the deal isn't advantageous."
