You can likely get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $150, and she's willing to sell for as low as $120.  There's room for negotiation!"

Alice has come down to $132, which is a good deal for you.  It's still within your budget, and you're saving $18 compared to buying from John.  It's time to accept the offer and move on!"
