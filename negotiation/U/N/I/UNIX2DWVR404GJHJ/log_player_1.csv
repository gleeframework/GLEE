"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, at $200, hoping to maximize my profit. This is likely to be rejected by Bob, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to try and get a better price.  While $150 is a guaranteed sale, I'm going to try to push Bob a little further.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to what I want, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price and see if Bob is willing to go a little higher. I have a few more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is a small increase from Bob's offer and might be more appealing to him. I'm hoping that by demonstrating some flexibility, I can get him to agree to a price that is more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. With only a few rounds left, I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105.  This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price. I hope this offer will convince Bob to close the deal, especially considering the limited rounds remaining."
