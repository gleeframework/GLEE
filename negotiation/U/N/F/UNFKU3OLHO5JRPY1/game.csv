"Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident I can get the product for a better price elsewhere. If you're willing to come down to $140, I'm ready to make a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to compromise at $155. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",155.0,Alice,5,
