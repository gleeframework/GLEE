"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to tell if the product is worth $500,000 to you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to gather more information and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to see how Alice responds.  This will give me a better understanding of her price range and whether we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but $400,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'll counteroffer again to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $300,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to negotiate a price that's more favorable to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $450,000 is getting closer to my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she will walk away or I might end up paying more if I go to John. At this point, accepting the offer is the best option to secure the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
