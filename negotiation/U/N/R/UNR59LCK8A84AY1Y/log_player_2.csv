"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. This unique item is priced at $1200000, which I believe represents an excellent balance between its worth and the benefits it offers to you. I am confident that this investment will yield significant returns and meet your expectations. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($1,200,000)** is lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Accepting the offer** allows you to buy the product for a lower price than you would pay John.
* While you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, there's no guarantee of a better price, and it risks losing the opportunity to purchase the product."
