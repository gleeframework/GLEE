# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a significant return on investment for you.

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. While I understand your perspective, the  $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial adjustment that demonstrates my willingness to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, we're still quite far apart on price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I understand where you're coming from. However, we need to find a price point that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to drop to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits you stand to gain.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I'm sensing that we might be at an impasse. While I believe the product has value, exceeding my budget won't work. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options, even though I'd prefer to work with you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a significant decision for you, and I respect your position.  I've tried to be flexible throughout our negotiations. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for the full asking price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value the potential partnership we've discussed.  I'm willing to accept $1,450,000 as my final offer. This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my commitment to making this deal work.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing strong signals that she won't budge much further. Even though she's lowered her price, she mentioned another offer at her full asking price. This means she likely has a backup buyer and is less likely to go significantly below $1,450,000.

While you could try another counteroffer, you risk pushing Alice away entirely.  At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are unlikely to be significant enough to warrant risking the guaranteed deal with John."
