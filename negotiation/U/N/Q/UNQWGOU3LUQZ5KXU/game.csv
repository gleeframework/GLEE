"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential and worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $900,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the value you'll gain from this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations.  I'm willing to make another move to $850,000, but that's my bottom line. This offer reflects the product's true worth.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid we're too far apart to make a deal work.  My final offer is $775,000. I think that's more than fair given the market value.",775000.0,Bob,6,
