"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,800,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to consider other options.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to go up to $1,500,000, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'd like to add a small premium for the exclusivity and urgency of this deal. I'll sell the product to you for $1,525,000. This is my final offer.",1525000.0,Alice,5,
