**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than John's price.
* **Your maximum is $1,200,000:** You've stated your maximum budget is $1,200,000. Alice's offer is well within that limit.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice in this scenario."
