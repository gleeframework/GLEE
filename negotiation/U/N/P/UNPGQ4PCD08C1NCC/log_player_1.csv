Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob at a price that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Since Bob's offer of $900,000 is higher than my initial offer of $850,000, it's a decent offer. However, since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, I think I can do better. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

Let's say I'll offer it to Bob for $950,000.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob was willing to pay $900,000, I'll try to get closer to the true value of the product to him, which is $1,500,000. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his previous offer.

Let's say I'll offer it to Bob for $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is sticking to his guns and offering $950,000 again. Since this is a decent offer, but not as good as I was hoping for, I'll decide to sell the product to Bob at this price. After all, $950,000 is still a significant amount of money, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob.
