"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can we discuss this further?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, reflecting a compromise on my end. This price still offers you a significant value for the product, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let's explore this further.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking of $875,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Can we discuss this further?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still below my minimum price point. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to reduce my price to $890,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still a bit short. I'm thinking of $875,000 is a bit too high, but $860,000 feels more reasonable to me. Can we discuss this further and see if we can meet in the middle?",860000.0,Bob,6,
