"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns on your investment.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,900,000. This price reflects the unique value and substantial returns you'll gain from this investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the value proposition, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my budget.  I could potentially stretch to $1,300,000.  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and I hope we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and the effort you're making to reach a deal. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about $1,450,000?  This is a strong offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
