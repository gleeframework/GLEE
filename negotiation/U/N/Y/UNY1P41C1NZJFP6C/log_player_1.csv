I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $100. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but at this point, I don't think I'm going to get much higher. John is offering a guaranteed $100, which is my minimum and will allow me to walk away with a good deal."
