"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He has a clear goal to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than John's offer, there's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's minimum value as possible without going below it. By offering $8,500, he's showing a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8500 is just too low for me.  How about $9000?  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value the product has for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He is trying to save as much money as possible, and while $9,000 is not ideal, it is still better than John's offer of $10,000. Additionally, there is a risk of continuing negotiations and ending up with a worse price or losing time. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price and secures the deal."
