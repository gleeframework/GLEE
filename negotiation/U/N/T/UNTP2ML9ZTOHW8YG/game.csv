"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant inherent value, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $950,000, which reflects the value of the product to me while also giving you a reasonable return.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.",950000.0,Bob,4,
