# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,300,000 is way above his budget. He can get the product from John for $800,000, so he needs to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price.  He should continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to get closer to his ideal price of $800,000."
