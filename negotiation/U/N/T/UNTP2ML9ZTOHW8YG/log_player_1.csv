Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $950,000, which reflects the value of the product to me while also giving you a reasonable return.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we continue to work together.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a sure thing and avoids further negotiation."
