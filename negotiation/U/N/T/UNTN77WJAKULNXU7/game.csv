"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $950,000.  This still leaves room for profit for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit as well. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant price for me, and it allows you a good return.",900000.0,Bob,4,
