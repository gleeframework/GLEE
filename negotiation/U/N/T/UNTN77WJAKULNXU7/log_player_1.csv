Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value the product holds for him to create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $950,000.  This still leaves room for profit for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That's a significant price for me, and it allows you a good return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. It's still above my minimum, and it's close to Bob's last offer.  It's not ideal, but it's a quick sale and I don't want to risk him walking away completely."
