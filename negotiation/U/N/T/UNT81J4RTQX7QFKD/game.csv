"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 130? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $115? It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal.",115.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that 130 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try 125? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",125.0,Alice,5,
