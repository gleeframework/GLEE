"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $150. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try 130? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price. While it's closer to his target, it's worth continuing to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $115? It's a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 130 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we try 125? It's a fair price that's closer to your offer, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $125 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  While Bob could continue negotiating, John is offering the product for exactly what Bob is willing to pay. It's more efficient for Bob to simply buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
