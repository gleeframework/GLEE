Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how Alice might approach this, followed by the offer:

**Alice's Reasoning**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** Alice knows she has a safety net with John ($1,000,000), so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Alice knows the product is worth more to Bob ($1,200,000) than her minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Alice should leave some room for negotiation to incentivize Bob. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Creates a sense of exclusivity and value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is slightly below Bob's maximum valuation but well above Alice's minimum. This gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while maximizing Alice's profit. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Reinforces the value proposition without sounding desperate.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible approach. Alice could choose to start higher and negotiate down, or she could offer a more detailed explanation of the product's value to justify the price."
