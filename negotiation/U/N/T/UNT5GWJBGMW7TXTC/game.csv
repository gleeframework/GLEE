"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $110, and that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can do $100, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still stuck at $90. It's the absolute most I can afford. If you're not willing to budge, I'm seriously considering buying from John instead.",90.0,Bob,6,
