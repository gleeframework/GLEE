"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that we can reach an agreement that is more aligned with my current budget. I would like to propose a price of $800000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the value I place on it and the fact that there is another option available at this price point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
