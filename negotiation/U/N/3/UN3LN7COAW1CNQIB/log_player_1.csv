Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $14,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,800. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I'm going to try and push for a little bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,800 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $14,200.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  Even though $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not the amount I'd prefer. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
