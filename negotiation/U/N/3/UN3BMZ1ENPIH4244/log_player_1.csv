Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think it could really benefit you. I'm asking for $9,500, which is a steal considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above Alice's minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $8,000. 

By setting the price at $9,500, Alice creates a strong chance of:

* **Bob Accepting:** The price, while high, is still a good deal for him considering it's worth $10,000 to him.
* **Further Negotiation:**  Even if Bob counters, Alice has room to negotiate down slightly and still make a significant profit."
