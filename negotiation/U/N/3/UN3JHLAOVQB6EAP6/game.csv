"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're highlighting, $9,500 is a bit out of my budget.  Given my needs and research, I'm willing to offer $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be a valuable asset to my business.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I would like to propose an alternative. If we could find a middle ground, how about $9,000 for the product? This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that $8,750 is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  This allows you to make a profit while still keeping the deal within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your patience, Bob. I've considered your latest offer and am willing to negotiate further. How about $8,900 for the product? This price allows me to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive with your offer.",8900.0,Alice,5,
