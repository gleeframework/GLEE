"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a substantial amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, and believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $850000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $850000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more accurate reflection of the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While I understand the value you see in the product, $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to go up to $875000. This shows my commitment to reaching an agreement, but I'm confident it's also a fair price for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm thinking $912500 is a fair compromise, but I'm open to discussing further.",912500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely making progress.  $912500 is a better price than I initially thought, but I'm still hoping to close the deal a little lower. I'm willing to go up to $890000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while also remaining within my budget.",890000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued effort to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to see a bit more movement from you. I'm thinking $907500 is a fair compromise, but I'm open to discussing further. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to sell the product to you at this price.",907500.0,Alice,9,
