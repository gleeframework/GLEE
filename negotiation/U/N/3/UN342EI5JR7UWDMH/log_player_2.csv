Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,150,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will bring significant returns. Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to facilitate the deal. This price still provides you with a considerable advantage, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000.  Would you consider $950,000?  That would make this a very attractive deal for me."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to stay below $1,000,000, but $950,000 is still quite far from my bottom line. I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000, as a final offer.  This price still represents a good value for you, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
