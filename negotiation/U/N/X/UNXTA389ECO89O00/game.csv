"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let's get this deal done!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a fair offer, I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the value of this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's a price that still allows you to reap substantial benefits from this investment.  Let's close this deal. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Consider the long-term benefits and competitive edge it will give your business.  I'm prepared to make one final concession â€“ I'll accept $1,080,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
