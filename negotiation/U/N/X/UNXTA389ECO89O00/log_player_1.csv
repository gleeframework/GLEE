"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to you.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make him more receptive to the offer. 
* **Urgency:** The ""let's get this deal done"" adds a slight sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider accepting.

This strategy sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum target while still appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, especially considering the value of the product to him. 

By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and can present a counteroffer in the next round. This allows me to potentially secure a higher price while still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,000,000 is a fair offer, I need to ensure I get a return that reflects the value of this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and it's a price that still allows you to reap substantial benefits from this investment.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and show willingness to compromise, but not at a price that undervalues my product.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the unique value and potential benefits of the product to Bob, reminding him why a higher price is justified.
* **Finality:** The ""Let's close this deal"" phrase subtly adds pressure, encouraging Bob to consider accepting my offer. 

By offering $1,100,000, I'm aiming for a price point that's more appealing to Bob while still staying above my minimum threshold. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also maintains my position of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum target, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer.  

* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a higher price than $1,050,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and can potentially secure a better deal in the next round.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob falls through.

I will proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my ideal outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Consider the long-term benefits and competitive edge it will give your business.  I'm prepared to make one final concession â€“ I'll accept $1,080,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm framing my offer as a final concession, emphasizing that I'm coming down to a price point that is close to Bob's offer but still protects my interests.
* **Reminding Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, emphasizing the potential long-term benefits and competitive edge it will give his business.
* **Fair Deal:** I'm presenting the offer as a win-win scenario, positioning it as a fair price that satisfies both of us. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and convince Bob to accept the deal, while still ensuring I receive a price that's above my minimum target. It's crucial to strike a balance between being firm and demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd ideally prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is a good compromise considering the potential risk of further negotiation. 

* **Time Constraint:**  We are in Round 6, and each rejected offer brings us closer to the possibility of having to sell to John at a significantly lower price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a safe and profitable transaction, minimizing the risk of further negotiation falling through. 
* **Better Than John:**  $1,060,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000, making this a more attractive outcome.

By accepting Bob's offer, I can secure a substantial profit while mitigating the potential for a more unfavorable outcome."
