"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $2,000,000?  This reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this deal done, let's settle this right now. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my absolute best. It's a fantastic deal for a product of this caliber.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous counteroffer. How about we settle on $1,825,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1825000.0,Bob,6,
