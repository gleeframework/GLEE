"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $16,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John for that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While she claims the product is worth $15,000 to you, you have a better option - buying from John for $15,000.  You can save $1,500 by going with John."
