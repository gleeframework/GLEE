"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $950,000?  This is a significant discount and demonstrates my commitment to a successful deal.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $875,000? That's a significant move on my part.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $912,500 for the product.  This is a fair compromise and shows my dedication to making this deal work.  I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we meet in the middle of our last offers, at $893,750? That feels like a fair deal to me.",893750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $893,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $903,125?  It's a small step from my last offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.",903125.0,Alice,7,
