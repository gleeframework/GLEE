Round 3

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do better. How about we meet at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is slowly lowering her price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $115.  We're running out of rounds and John offers a guaranteed price of $100, which is a better deal than anything Alice has offered so far."
