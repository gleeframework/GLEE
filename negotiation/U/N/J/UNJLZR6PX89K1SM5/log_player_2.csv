"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that is fair to both of us. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable product at a price that is significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
