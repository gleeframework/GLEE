# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not comfortable going below $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $10,000.  It's better to secure the $8,000 deal with John."
