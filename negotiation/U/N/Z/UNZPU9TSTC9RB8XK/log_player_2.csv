"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $9,500. It's a fantastic opportunity to own something that's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so you don't want to pay more than that. Alice's offer of $9,500 is too high. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $9,000, but I have to make a profit. I can do $9,300 for you, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is still slightly higher than the $9,000 you were hoping for, but it's lower than John's price of $10,000 and gets you closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible.  It's a good compromise and worth accepting."
