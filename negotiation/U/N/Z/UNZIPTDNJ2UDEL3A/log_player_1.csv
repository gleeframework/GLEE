Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly, potentially leading to a faster deal. 
* **Above John's Offer:**  It's crucial that the offer is significantly above John's $12,000 offer. This ensures that even if Bob negotiates down a bit, you're still getting a better deal than selling to John."
