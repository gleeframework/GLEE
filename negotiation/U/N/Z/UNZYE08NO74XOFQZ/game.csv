"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a good compromise that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  $1,125,000 is getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,187,500? It's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1187500.0,Alice,5,
