"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,000? This is a fair price considering the value and it's still a significant discount from what I'm able to sell it for elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
