"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it's worth at least $1,500,000 to someone like you who can really maximize its potential.  To start the conversation, I'm offering it to you for $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,350,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I've had substantial interest in it, and I know I can get a much higher price. To keep things moving, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a very fair offer, considering the value it holds.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value.  I am serious about purchasing it, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to go to $950,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a realistic price point.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, your commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement is appreciated.  Let's bridge this gap. While I can't accept $950,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to see this valuable product in your hands. ",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you moving on the price.  To be straightforward, my budget ceiling is $1,000,000.  If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, but I may need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
