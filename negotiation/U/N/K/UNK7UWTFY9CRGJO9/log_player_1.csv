"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it would be perfect for you. My starting price is $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100, but still within a range where Bob might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm subtly highlighting the product's value for Bob, even though I'm not giving specifics. This might make him more inclined to consider my offer.

**Remember:** I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($100) as possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob is too stubborn."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** While it's tempting to take $90, it's not worth it to me in this scenario. 
* **I still have rounds left.** I can counteroffer Bob and try to close the deal closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is an option.** If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can always sell to John for $100, which is a guaranteed profit.

**Next steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $100 and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Suggesting ""meeting in the middle""  makes the offer feel fair and reasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 

**Next steps:** I'll see if Bob accepts my counteroffer or makes another one. If he's still too low, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.** I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price, especially since I have other options.
* **I still have rounds left.**  I can continue to negotiate with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is a safe alternative.** If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always sell to John for $100. 

**Next steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'll need to decide how much lower I'm willing to go to try and close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm still open to finding a solution. Let's try $90 - that's a fair price for both of us, wouldn't you agree?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but coming down a bit to show willingness to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing $90 as a ""fair price for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, keeping the conversation friendly and encouraging a resolution.

**Next Steps:**  I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer. If he doesn't, I'll have to carefully consider my options for the next round.  Selling to John is always a possibility, but I'd like to see if I can close the deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, even though it's a slight increase.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic and aim for a price closer to my target.
* **John is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John is a viable option if I can't get a better deal from Bob.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer Bob again, trying to meet somewhere in the middle between his offer and my minimum acceptable price. I'll also need to seriously consider selling to John if Bob doesn't budge in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet me halfway.  I'm open to considering a bit more flexibility, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a great opportunity for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle (again):** Suggesting ""meeting in the middle"" again makes the offer feel fair and reasonable. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  I'm highlighting the opportunity for Bob, which might motivate him to accept.

**Next steps:**  I'll see if Bob accepts my counteroffer or makes another one. If he's still too low, I'll have to decide whether to lower my price further or move on to John. The pressure is mounting with fewer rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining, and Bob refusing to budge on his offer, I need to act decisively.
* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:**  $85 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $100 ensures I get my minimum acceptable price.  This is a safe and reliable option.

**Decision:** It's time to move on and sell to John.  The risk of continuing with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price is too high, especially with so few rounds left."
