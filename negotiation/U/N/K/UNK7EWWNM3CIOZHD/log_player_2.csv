"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a high-quality item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $12,000 is more than Bob's budget, and it's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  It's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob doesn't want to miss out on a potentially better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500 just yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still determined to get the best possible price.  $10,800 is still above his budget, and he has 5 more rounds to negotiate with Alice.  There's still room for a counteroffer and a possible better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I hear you about needing a fair price, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  I'm willing to go up to $10,200.  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $10,200. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is still determined to get the best possible price.  While $10,500 is close to his budget, he's still willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try to get a better deal. He has 3 rounds remaining. It's worth trying for that final $500 savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy we're getting closer. I'm going to stick with my offer of $10,200. I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has only one round left. While he can try to make another counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept. Buying from John for $10,000 is still an option, but Alice's offer is only $250 more than that, and Bob is getting closer to his budget goal. It's a calculated risk to accept, but it's the best option to secure the product without risking losing out completely."
