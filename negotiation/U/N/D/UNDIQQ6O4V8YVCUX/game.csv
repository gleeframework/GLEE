"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
