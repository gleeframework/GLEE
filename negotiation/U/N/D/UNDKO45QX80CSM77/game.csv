"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for your budget, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $13,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
