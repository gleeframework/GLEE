"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your initial offer, the product's value is considerably higher than that.

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. To be frank, anything above $800,000 is pushing my absolute limit.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",750000.0,Bob,6,
