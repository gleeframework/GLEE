"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to you.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
