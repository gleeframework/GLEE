"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let me know if this works for you.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $15,000 is still a bit higher than I had hoped. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, say, at $12,000? That would be my absolute limit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
