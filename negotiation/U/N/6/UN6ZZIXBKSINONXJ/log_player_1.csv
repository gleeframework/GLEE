Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price.
* **Justification:**  Offering a reason for your price, even if it's just perceived value, can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer is as much about gauging Bob's interest as it is about getting him to accept the $12,000. If he flat out refuses, you can always lower the price slightly.

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, it's still ideal to get the highest price possible from Bob."
