Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer is not too high to deter Bob completely, leaving room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer.
* **Setting a positive tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product for more than my minimum price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum price:** I'm aiming for at least $10,000 for the product.
* **Potential for a higher price:** Bob has acknowledged the product's value, suggesting there's still room for negotiation.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John right now would mean no profit beyond my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly higher than his offer, but lower than my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation going while acknowledging Bob's position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's true value, justifying the price.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and open to finding common ground.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a price higher than my minimum and closed the deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess the situation:
    * If he makes another counteroffer, I'll weigh it against selling to John.
    * If he becomes too inflexible, I may decide to sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your suggestion, Alice, but I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this offer suits you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has remained firm on his offer of $10,000, indicating there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation would likely consume more time and effort without a guarantee of a higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $10,000, eliminating the risk of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll sell the product to John, ensuring a secure profit and ending the negotiation with Bob."
