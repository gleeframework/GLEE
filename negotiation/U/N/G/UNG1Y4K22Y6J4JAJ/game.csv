"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can do $1,300,000.  This is a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
