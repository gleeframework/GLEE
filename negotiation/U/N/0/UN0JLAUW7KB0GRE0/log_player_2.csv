"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $9,000 from Alice.  You know Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's perceived value ($8,000) to show I'm serious about buying but still aiming for a significant discount from the initial $9,000 offer. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than my previous offer, but it's still lower than John's price.  I'm going to counteroffer again to try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer by $250, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is still lower than Alice's last offer and remains within my budget. This allows for further negotiation while keeping the deal attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offers are getting closer to my maximum budget, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a lower price from her.  It's better to buy from John and be done with the negotiation.  This ensures I have the product without spending more than my limit."
