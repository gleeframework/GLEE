"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John immediately since you can get the same price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $70. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is moving in the right direction, but I can still try to get a better deal. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 72}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer.  $72 is a reasonable price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice is now only $1 away from my maximum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to accept her offer and save $7."
