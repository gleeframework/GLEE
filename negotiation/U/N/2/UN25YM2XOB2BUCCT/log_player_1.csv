Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without explicitly stating the minimum you'd accept.
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other interested parties"" create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

By starting high, Alice maximizes her potential profit. If Bob accepts the $1,200,000 offer, she earns significantly more. If he negotiates down, she still has a good chance of exceeding her minimum acceptable price of $800,000."
