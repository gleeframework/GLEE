"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $8500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. Based on your offer, I propose a counteroffer of $9500 for the product. This price still reflects the value and quality of the product, while being more aligned with your budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable, and we can move forward with the transaction.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. If that doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",9000.0,Bob,4,
