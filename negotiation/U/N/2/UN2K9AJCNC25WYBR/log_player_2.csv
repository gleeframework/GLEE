"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. It's better to reject Alice's offer and explore other options or negotiate with her further."
