"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential negotiation range without immediately risking selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point of $15,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $15,000, my minimum acceptable price.  Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, and this price is still within his value range. I'm aiming for a quick resolution in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $14,000, which is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm concerned about losing out to John. I'll accept the offer and secure the sale."
