Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I need to get at least $15,000 for this product, as that's its value to me.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob is willing to pay $8,000, so any offer higher than that is a potential win for me.
* **John's Value:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, so I have a safety net in case Bob rejects my offer. 

By offering $12,000, I'm aiming for a good compromise: 
* It's significantly more than Bob's value, giving him a potential deal.
* It's less than John's value, meaning I still get a decent profit if Bob declines."
