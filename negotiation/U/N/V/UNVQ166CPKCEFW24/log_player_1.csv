"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always best to start with a higher price, especially since you know the product is worth at least $120 to you. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $100 leaves room for negotiation, allowing for a potential compromise that still benefits you. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  $80 is below your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is still interested, so there's room for further negotiation.  You can counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.
* **Selling to John is premature:**  You haven't explored all your options with Bob.  Selling to John now would guarantee a $120 sale, but you might be able to do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This still gives me a reasonable profit, and I think it's a fair price for this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $95 is a compromise, splitting the difference between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows you're serious about making a deal.
* **Justifying the price:**  The message emphasizes that the price is still fair, even at a lower amount.
* **Positive tone:**  The message maintains a positive tone, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $80 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your minimum:** $90 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  There's still room to potentially increase the price. You can counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **John is a fallback:**  While John offers a guaranteed $120, there's still time to see if you can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point.  Let's split the difference one more time. How about $92? It's closer to your offer and still a good deal for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:**  This counteroffer further demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Small increase:**  Increasing the price by just $2 shows you're willing to move but not give in completely.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message remains optimistic and invites Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $92 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $92, which is $86. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Price is nearing minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still below your desired price point. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept a counteroffer, and further rounds could lead to a lower price or stalemate.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees you $120, which is a safe and profitable option, given the limited time remaining."
