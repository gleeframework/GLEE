Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor, but with ""Justification"":** Starting with a price well above Bob's perceived value ($1,300,000 vs. $800,000) aims to set a high anchor. However, simply throwing out a high number might be off-putting.  The message includes a phrase about ""unique value proposition"" to vaguely justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it leaves room for him to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle above your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Alternative Guarantee:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer willing to pay your minimum acceptable price provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
