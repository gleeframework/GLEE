I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, allowing for some negotiation room while still ensuring I get a profit."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $130 is a good price, especially considering the limited number of rounds remaining. It's much better than selling to John for $100."
