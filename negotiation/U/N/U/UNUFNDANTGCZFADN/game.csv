"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price you're comfortable with, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price you're comfortable with, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10700.0,Alice,7,
