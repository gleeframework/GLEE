"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, and Alice's offer is higher than that. There's no reason to accept a higher price when a lower one is available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to him, and he wants to save as much as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still within a range that might be acceptable to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal, but he's also starting to realize that Alice might not be willing to go as low as $9,000. By increasing his counteroffer to $9,500, he's showing that he's willing to compromise but also that he still believes the product is worth less than Alice's asking price. This is a more realistic counteroffer that could potentially lead to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice's offer is only $500 lower than what Bob can get from John. It's not a significant enough saving to justify the risk of further negotiations. Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000 to ensure he gets a good deal and avoids further potential delays and uncertainty."
