"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and high-quality item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is very tempting, but it's worth exploring if we can get a better price.  There's no harm in rejecting the first offer and seeing if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $75. I appreciate your interest in the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $82.50 is still above my maximum budget of $150. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $80. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. Would you be willing to meet me at $84? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still not within my comfort zone. I want to see if I can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John. I'll reject the offer and try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $84 is still too much for me. I'm happy to split the difference and offer you $82. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not willing to go below $83. I think this product is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. Would you be willing to meet me at $83? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $83 is getting very close to my final offer of $82. We're only $1 apart. At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only waste time.  I'm comfortable accepting her offer and securing the product, rather than risking further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or even a higher price.  It's also getting close to my limit of 10 rounds."
