"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than Bob's maximum, he can potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to drop the price further, as the product is worth $12,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting by offering a price that's halfway between Alice's offer ($14,000) and his maximum ($15,000). This is a reasonable starting point that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but also wants a good deal. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate without having to give up too much profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has dropped her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $15,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John.  It's unlikely Bob can negotiate a significantly lower price in the next round, so accepting the offer is the most financially sensible choice."
