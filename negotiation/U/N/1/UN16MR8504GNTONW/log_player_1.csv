"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing your product, but within my budget of $800,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I still have more negotiation rounds to try and get a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $800,000 is simply not viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant discount and represents a fair compromise. Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Given your last offer, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. It's still below my ideal range, but I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm going to keep pushing for a bit more. I still have plenty of rounds left, and selling to John for $1,500,000 is always an option if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. This offer reflects the value of the product for you while acknowledging my own financial needs. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. This is still below my ideal range, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept yet. I still have several rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better price.  I'm going to keep pushing for a bit more and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as my fallback option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,000,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product for me while also being a fair compromise for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $1,000,000 is still significantly below what I'd prefer, but we're running out of rounds. If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob as a buyer and then needing to rely on John's offer for $1,500,000.  There's always a chance that Bob will counter with something closer to $1,025,000 in the next round, but I'm not willing to gamble with that.  It's better to secure a sale now, even if it's not the ideal price."
