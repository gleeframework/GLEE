{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110, which is still a good deal for Alice considering her cost and is significantly lower than the $150 I could pay John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering $125, which is only $5 less than John's price.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm going to offer $115. This is a fair price that is still lower than John's offer, and hopefully, Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is now offering $130, which is only $20 less than John's price.  At this point, I've already made a couple of counteroffers, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a lower price from Alice. It's better to just buy the product from John for $150 to avoid further negotiation."
