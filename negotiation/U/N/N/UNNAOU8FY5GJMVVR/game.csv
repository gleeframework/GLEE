"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
