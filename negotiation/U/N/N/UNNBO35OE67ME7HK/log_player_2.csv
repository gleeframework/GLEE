"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price or go to John for a guaranteed lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still below Bob's maximum budget. This is a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even though it's lower than the original offer.  Since John is offering the product for $10,000, it's in Bob's best interest to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation. This guarantees the lowest price for Bob and saves time."
