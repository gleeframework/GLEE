Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well within your value range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this deal.
