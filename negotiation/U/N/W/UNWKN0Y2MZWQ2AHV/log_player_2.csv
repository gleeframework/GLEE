Alice's offer is way too high. We'll counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well within your value range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I bring to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $875,000 is getting closer to our limit, it's still too high. We'll try to negotiate a bit lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if $825,000 is enough to justify the value I'm bringing to the table. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is the sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. While we could continue negotiating, the risk of going over our budget or reaching a stalemate is too high. Buying from John guarantees the product for our desired price and saves time and effort."
