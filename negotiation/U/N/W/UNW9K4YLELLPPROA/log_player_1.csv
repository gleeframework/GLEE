Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, knowing Bob values the product at $150. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  Offering it at $130 gives Bob a $20 discount, making it a good deal for him while still securing a significant profit ($30) for you.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims for a strong initial offer that benefits both parties."
