I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000, I believe I can get a better price. I will counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will convince Bob to agree to a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation at this point.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure I get my minimum acceptable price."
