"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering and negotiating further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident the product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can still try to negotiate further, potentially getting a better price from Alice or even getting a lower price from John if you're willing to take the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You've already tried to negotiate a lower price, and Alice has shown a willingness to budge, but she's still not willing to meet your budget.  

At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $1,000,000.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to get you a better price, and you risk her rejecting your offer again, leaving you with nothing."
