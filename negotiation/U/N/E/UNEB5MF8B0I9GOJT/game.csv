"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product at a price significantly lower than its true value. I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This price represents a substantial savings for you, while still allowing me to make a respectable profit. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
