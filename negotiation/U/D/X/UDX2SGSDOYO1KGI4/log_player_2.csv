"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $160. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's much better to negotiate or even buy directly from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $160 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $60."",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. We're aiming low to leave room for compromise while staying well below our maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $60 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $110 is still too high. We're getting closer to our limit, but there's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $110 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. By offering $75, we're showing willingness to compromise while staying below our $80 limit. This also keeps the negotiation moving and encourages Alice to counter-offer again."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to wrap this up. How about $95?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is firm at $95 and has stated it's her final offer.  While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely we'll get her below $80, our maximum price and John's offer.  It's time to cut our losses and buy from John."
