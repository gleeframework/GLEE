"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but Alice is asking for $1,200,000. There is room for negotiation. 
* **Rejecting gives you leverage.** By rejecting, you signal that you are not desperate and are willing to walk away. This puts pressure on Alice to lower her price.

**Next Steps:**

You will need to make a counteroffer in the next round.  Consider a counteroffer significantly lower than $1,200,000, but still within a range you are willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant reduction:** A counteroffer of $900,000 represents a substantial decrease from Alice's initial price of $1,200,000. This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate but also shows that you're serious about a deal.
* **Within your budget:** This price is still within your budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Balancing boldness and fairness:** The counteroffer is aggressive enough to pressure Alice, but not so low that it seems unreasonable or insults her.

**Next Steps:**

Wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer.  If she rejects, you can make another counteroffer, keeping in mind that you have 10 rounds to reach an agreement. Remember, you can always choose to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still significantly above your desired price point. 
* **Negotiation room:** You have 7 rounds left, meaning there's still time to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Alice's offer again will continue to show her that you are serious about getting a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Alice in the next round.  Consider a price lower than $1,050,000 but still within your budget and reasonable based on the previous rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental decrease:** This counteroffer represents a smaller decrease from Alice's latest price of $1,050,000, showing that you are willing to compromise but still seeking a better price. 
* **Testing the waters:** It's a way to gauge how willing Alice is to come down further. 
* **Staying within budget:** This price is still within your budget, keeping your options open.

**Next Steps:**

Wait for Alice's response to your counteroffer.  If she rejects, consider another incremental decrease, keeping in mind the remaining rounds and the potential fallback option of buying from John."
