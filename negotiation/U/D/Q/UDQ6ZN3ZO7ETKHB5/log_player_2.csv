"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an amazing product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make me a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, you have no information about her bottom line. You can always buy the product from John for the same price, so it makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
