"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the price he can get from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes Bob's desire for a much lower price and also leaves room for negotiation in future rounds.  It's a good starting point as it is still above John's offer, making it a more attractive option than John's deal to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price significantly, and her offer is now within Bob's budget.  While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a good deal considering John's price and the possibility of Alice rejecting further counteroffers. It's a good compromise, and Bob can secure the product without further risk."
