Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $130 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still more than Alice's valuation of the product.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and attempt to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been consistently trying to negotiate a lower price, but Alice has been firm.  At this point, Alice's offer of $125 is still within Bob's budget ($150) and is closer to Bob's ideal price.  It's a reasonable compromise, and it's likely that further negotiation will be futile.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to acquire the product while still saving money compared to buying from John."
