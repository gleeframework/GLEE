Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very useful.  I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but lower than John's offer, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Enthusiasm:** The message is friendly and emphasizes potential value for Bob, increasing the chance of a counteroffer. 
* **Flexibility:** This allows me to see if Bob is willing to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, indicating a chance to reach a higher price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $150, so I can afford to be more assertive with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing that even at $140, the product is a good deal for Bob.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Encouraging a quick decision:** The message urges Bob to make a decision, increasing the likelihood of a swift resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've given this some thought and would like to propose $130 as the price for the product. It's higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While I'd like to make more money, the guaranteed $150 from John is the safest and most efficient option at this point."
