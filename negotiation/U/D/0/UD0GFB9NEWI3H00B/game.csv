"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $107.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $106.25? This would be a fair price for both of us.",106.25,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106.25. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, and I'll sell it to you for $108. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",108.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $107. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $109. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really love the product.",109.0,Alice,7,
