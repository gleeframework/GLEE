Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($80), and gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $85. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum. I believe it's a fair price that gives Bob some room to negotiate but still allows me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now close to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking losing the sale and getting only $80 from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer of $82."
