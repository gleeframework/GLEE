Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than or equal to $1,200,000) while maximizing your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value and could greatly benefit you. I'm offering it at a competitive price of $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is straightforward and highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Competitive Price:** Offering it slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) makes it more enticing.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** While you have a backup offer, pushing Bob too hard (too close to $1,200,000) might make him walk away.  This offer balances risk and reward."
