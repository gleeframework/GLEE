"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and will be worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to him ($15,000) to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not demanding the full $15,000, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Open communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is low:**  While $9,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves me less profit. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I believe I can get a better price, given that Bob is interested and acknowledged the product's value to him. 
* **Not rushing to sell:** Selling to John for $8,000 is a safe option, but it's not the best possible outcome. I want to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  I'm responding to Bob's offer with a counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Splitting the difference:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my last offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and fairness.
* **Emphasizing the value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $10,500, he's still getting a good deal compared to the product's value to him.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  I'm using a positive and open tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $10,500.  This shows that we're both willing to compromise.
* **Good profit:**  $10,000 is significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 and allows me to make a good profit. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance that Bob might continue to haggle, and I might not be able to secure a better price. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $10,000 is a good compromise that ensures I make a decent profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
