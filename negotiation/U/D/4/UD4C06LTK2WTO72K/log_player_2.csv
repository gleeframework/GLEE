"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  There's still a lot of room for negotiation, and I want to see how low Alice is willing to go before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to be mindful of the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counter with an offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe I can negotiate a lower price, especially given that I have a backup option with John. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer, aiming to find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will work for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I have to be realistic about the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm going to counter with an offer of $825,000. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price point. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $1,200,000 is too high.  At this point, I'm comfortable accepting the offer and securing the product for a good price."
