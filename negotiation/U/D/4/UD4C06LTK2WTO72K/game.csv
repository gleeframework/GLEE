"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I have to be mindful of the product's value. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to counter with an offer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it will work for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I have to be realistic about the product's value.
