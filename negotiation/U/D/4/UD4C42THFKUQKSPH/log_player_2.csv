"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as what John is offering.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting it keeps the option open to potentially negotiate with Alice or find a better deal elsewhere."
