{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring you earn significantly more than your minimum price of $8,000. It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing the value Bob will receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum desired price of $8,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit far from my target. How about we meet at $8,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly your minimum price. While it's not ideal, it's a fair deal, and accepting ensures you don't risk getting nothing by continuing to negotiate or going with John's offer."
