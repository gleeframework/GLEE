"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $750,000 is still a tough pill to swallow, but I'm willing to come down to $875,000 if it means we can close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
