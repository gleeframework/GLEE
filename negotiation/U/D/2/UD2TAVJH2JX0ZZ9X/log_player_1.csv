"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make my offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as there's still potential to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 10 rounds, I have time to explore other options and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to his value but still above my minimum threshold.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm not accepting his offer, but I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making the price seem more reasonable. 
* **Seeking Agreement:** I'm expressing a desire to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $9000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above My Minimum:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Time is on My Side:**  With 6 rounds left, I can continue to explore options and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Value of Time:** Holding out could lead to Bob becoming more willing to meet my terms as the negotiation progresses."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, but $9,000 isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference at $9,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Fair Price Justification:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, making the price seem more reasonable and encouraging him to accept.
* **Urgency and Action:** I'm expressing a desire to reach an agreement, encouraging Bob to take action and close the deal. 
* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small compromise, signaling that I'm serious about selling the product to Bob."
