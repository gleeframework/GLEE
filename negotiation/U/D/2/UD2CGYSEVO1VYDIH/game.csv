"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $13500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the value this product will bring to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13250. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to add a premium, but $13250 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $13125.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",13125.0,Bob,6,
