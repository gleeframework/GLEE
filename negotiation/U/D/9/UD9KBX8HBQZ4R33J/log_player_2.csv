The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95. It's better to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $85 for the product. This is still above my maximum price, but I hope it's a reasonable starting point for negotiations."

Alice is still offering a price higher than my maximum. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80."
