"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,800,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This reflects the fair market value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the value this product holds for me is quite significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.
