"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price. Since you're willing to pay up to $12,000, there's room to haggle.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

Let's start with a significant counteroffer. $4,000 is a considerable drop from Alice's initial price, but still within the range where I'm comfortable buying the product.  This should give Alice some room to negotiate while still being a good deal for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is coming down, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. Let's see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $4,500.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still leaving room for her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still not quite satisfied with the price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  If she rejects again, I'll be forced to choose between her offer and John's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4800}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only slightly to $4,800.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not going to go much higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $5,000 is very close to my target price. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and I've already invested a good amount of time negotiating.  It's time to accept this offer and secure the product."
