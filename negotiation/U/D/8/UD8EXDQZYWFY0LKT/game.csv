"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, given its worth to you, and it allows me to get a fair price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is fair considering your value for it and my own budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good value for you considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
