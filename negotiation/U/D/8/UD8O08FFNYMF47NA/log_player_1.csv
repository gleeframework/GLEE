"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal considering its value to you!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob might make him more willing to compromise.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message implies I'm open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a quick deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is interested and has made a counteroffer, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **More rounds left:**  I have 9 rounds remaining to secure a better price, making it worthwhile to continue the negotiation.

**Next steps:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's current offer, keeping the negotiation moving towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,400,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:** My counteroffer is $200,000 above Bob's offer, but still below my minimum acceptable price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the deal's potential benefit.
* **Open to compromise:** My message shows flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to increase his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob is showing a willingness to continue negotiations, so there's still potential for a better offer.
* **More rounds available:** I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me time to explore further options and potentially secure a better deal.

**Next steps:** I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still above Bob's offer. My goal is to keep the pressure on Bob to reach my desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  My counteroffer is $100,000 higher than Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:**  The price is still above Bob's offer, indicating I'm not desperate for a quick deal. 
* **Highlighting value and fairness:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and that my offer is a fair compromise.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while simultaneously maintaining my position and pushing for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,300,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is becoming difficult:** Bob has shown resistance to further increases, and the negotiations are becoming increasingly difficult. 
* **Time is running out:**  We only have 4 rounds remaining, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of failing to close the deal with Bob.

**Conclusion:** 

The risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and losing valuable time is too high.  Selling to John provides a safe and profitable option, ensuring a guaranteed outcome within the remaining time."
