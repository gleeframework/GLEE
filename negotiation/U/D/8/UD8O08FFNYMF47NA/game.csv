,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,400,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $1,350,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product you value. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1,300,000 is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,6,
