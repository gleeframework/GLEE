"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $1,400,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount of money. You have room to negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup provides leverage. You can use this to push Alice to lower her price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value, and it leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price point, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the value of this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,350,000 is still above your target price. 
* **Negotiation space:** There's still room to negotiate.  You can try a counteroffer closer to your desired price point. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can use John's offer as a reference point during your negotiation with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,300,000.
