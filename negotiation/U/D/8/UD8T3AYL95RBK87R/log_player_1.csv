Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential value, and it leaves room for both of us to profit. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price point, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the value of this deal. "",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a strong deal. It significantly exceeds my minimum price and provides a healthy profit margin."
