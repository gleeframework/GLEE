,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1500000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to avoid selling to John. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1200000 is closer, I'm still unable to go above my maximum of $1100000.  This would allow us both to close the deal and avoid going to John. Let's finalize this.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
