"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, I'm still finding $8,500 a bit high.  Would you be willing to consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $8,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let me know if that works for you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
