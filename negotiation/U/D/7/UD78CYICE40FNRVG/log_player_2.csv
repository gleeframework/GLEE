You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to see if a better price can be achieved with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between Alice's initial price and his target price. This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate seriously while still leaving room for further negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000. It's still worth trying to negotiate further, especially since there are still several rounds left. Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should explore all possibilities to get the best possible price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target. There are still rounds left, and Bob can potentially negotiate a better price. Buying from John is always a backup option, but continuing to negotiate with Alice seems like the better choice at this point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target, but it's getting closer. Bob is within his budget and has a few more rounds to negotiate. There's still potential to reach a more favorable price, and it's worth trying. Buying from John is always an option, but Bob should continue to try and secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 995000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push, increasing his offer slightly to show his willingness to close the deal. This counteroffer is only $20,000 above his target price and might be enough to sway Alice, especially with only two rounds remaining.  If this offer is rejected, Bob will likely switch to John in the next round to avoid exceeding his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's target price. With only one round left, there's not enough time to negotiate further and risk Alice rejecting Bob's final counteroffer.  Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, even though it's not the absolute lowest price."
