Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $875,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I believe I can get a better price if I continue to negotiate with Bob.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but at $890,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive, and it's still a win for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is finally above my minimum threshold of $800,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to consider that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures I receive a satisfactory price."
