Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it offers great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always better to start with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Leave Room for John:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, aiming higher with Bob allows you to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Confident Approach:**  The message is framed positively, focusing on the product's value rather than seeming desperate for a sale.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer. 
* **Market Conditions:** If similar products are selling for significantly lower than $150, you might need to adjust your price.

This strategy gives you the best chance of getting the highest price possible from Bob, while still having the safety net of John's offer."
