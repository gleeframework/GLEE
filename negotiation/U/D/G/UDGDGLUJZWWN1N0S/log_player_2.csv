"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

You can try to get a better price from Alice. You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice's offer is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for such a great product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $110 is still above your ideal price, but it's within your budget and closer to your initial counteroffer. It's a reasonable compromise and saves you $10 compared to buying from John."
