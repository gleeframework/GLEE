Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
