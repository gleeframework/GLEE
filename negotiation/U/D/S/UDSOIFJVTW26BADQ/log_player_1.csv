Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not starting at my minimum, I allow for potential negotiation and potentially reach a higher price than my initial offer. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely push for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net that allows me to be firm in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This price is still very good for you, and I believe we can make this deal work.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility but not giving away too much.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value proposition and emphasizing that my offer is still very good for him.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using language that encourages continued negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Clear Deadline:** I'm implicitly setting a deadline by suggesting a final attempt to find common ground. This adds a sense of urgency to the negotiation."
