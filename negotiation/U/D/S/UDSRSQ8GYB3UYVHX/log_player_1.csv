"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's estimated value, hoping to incentivize him to accept while still securing a good price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still holding out for a higher price than Bob's offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that will keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}

I'm lowering my price again to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
