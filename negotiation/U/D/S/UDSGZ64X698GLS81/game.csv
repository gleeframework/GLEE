"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,500?  This gives you a good price while still allowing me to make a decent profit. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $10,500 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet at $10,250? This would be a good middle ground, and I believe it would be a worthwhile investment for you.  Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,5,
