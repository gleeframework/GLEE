"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. This first offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for such a low price at this stage. I will counteroffer to try and secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground by reducing my price slightly.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of your product, but I am still looking for a more affordable option. I would like to propose a price of $140. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it's getting closer.  Considering I have limited rounds and John is willing to pay $150, accepting Bob's offer is the best option to secure a sale and avoid losing out on potential profit."
