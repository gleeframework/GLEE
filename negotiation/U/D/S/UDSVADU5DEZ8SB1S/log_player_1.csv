"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it at $18,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $18,000, you're trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects the initial price, his counteroffers might be closer to your desired range.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $18,000 offer leaves ample room for you to gradually lower the price over subsequent rounds while still staying above your $12,000 minimum. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still too early in the negotiation to accept. There's potential to negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob expressed interest. Accepting now would leave money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? I'm confident this product will bring you a lot of value."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By coming down to $15,000, you demonstrate willingness to negotiate and move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This offer splits the difference between your Round 1 offer and Bob's Round 2 offer, a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value to Bob can subtly nudge him towards accepting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! While $13,500 is a decent offer, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price.  Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the back-and-forth. Let's see if we can push a bit further before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work. Would you consider $14,250?"", ""product_price"": 14250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concessions:** We're now making smaller concessions to signal that we're reaching our limit. 
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:**  This price aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.
* **Direct but Respectful:** The tone remains respectful and open to negotiation, but firmly states your need to be closer to the $15,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $13,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is proposing a price that is exactly halfway between the previous offers. This signals a strong desire to close the deal and often indicates a point of compromise.
* **Strong Profit Margin:** $13,750 is a solid profit above your minimum of $12,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or getting stuck at a lower price. Accepting now secures a good deal."
