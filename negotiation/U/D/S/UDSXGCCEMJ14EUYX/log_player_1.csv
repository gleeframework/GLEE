Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you'd like to proceed."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's lower than John's offer, it leaves room for negotiation while aiming closer to your desired outcome.
* **Scarcity & Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly implies that if Bob doesn't take it, someone else will, potentially motivating him to act quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** Focusing on the ""investment"" aspect speaks to Bob's potential gains rather than just framing it as a purchase.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and inviting, leaving the door open for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential agreement above his initial valuation.

This approach seeks to maximize profit while maintaining a balance between assertiveness and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
