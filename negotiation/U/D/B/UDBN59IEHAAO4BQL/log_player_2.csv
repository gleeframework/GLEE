"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob and Alice is willing to sell for $90, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the first offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity. However, I'm hoping to get a slightly better price. How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by making a reasonable counteroffer.  He's acknowledging Alice's offer but expressing his desire for a lower price. $85 is a compromise that still leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $85 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $87.50.
* **John's price:** John is selling the product for $100.

Alice's offer is the best option for Bob. It's lower than John's price and still provides a good deal, especially considering the limited rounds.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings might not be worth the risk of losing the deal with Alice or having to buy from John at a higher price."
