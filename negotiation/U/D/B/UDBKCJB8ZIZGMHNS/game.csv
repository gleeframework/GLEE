"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that high.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's aim for a deal that works for us both.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1100000. This is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $1100000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1150000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1125000.  This would be a mutually beneficial deal and would allow us to finalize the transaction. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
