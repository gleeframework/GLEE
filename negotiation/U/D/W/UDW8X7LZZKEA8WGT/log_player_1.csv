Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to start with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price, but I also have the option of selling to John for $100 if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is better than my minimum price of $100, I think I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm not sure how much he's willing to pay, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could continue negotiating, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. John is offering me $100, which is a good price, so I'm going to sell to him."
