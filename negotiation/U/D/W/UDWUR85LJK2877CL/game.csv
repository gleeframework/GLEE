"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but considering my budget constraints, I am unable to pay such a high amount. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to something more reasonable, perhaps closer to $500,000? I understand the value of the product, but I'm hoping for a more affordable solution.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $500,000 is far below its true value.  This product would bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your position, but I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify the price. Could we consider $800,000 as a compromise? I'm trying to find a balance between what I'm willing to pay and the true value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's make this our final offer: $1,000,000. This is the same price John has offered, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
