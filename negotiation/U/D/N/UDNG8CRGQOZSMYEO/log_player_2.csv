"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000.
* **John's offer is better:** John is selling the same product for $800,000, which aligns with your budget.

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the most cost-effective option."
