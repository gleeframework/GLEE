"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer you the product for $13,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,5,
