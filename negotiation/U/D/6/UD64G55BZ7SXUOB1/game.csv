"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below my bottom line. I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,800,000 is your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to accept, I'll buy the product from you. If not, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $800,000.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
