"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I believe will be highly valuable for your business. Given its potential impact, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I'm confident this price represents a fair value for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is above my budget. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but this product has the potential to generate significant returns for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still leaves ample room for profit for you, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. This offer reflects the value I see in the product, while also staying within my budget. Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your perspective, $950,000 is still below my minimum. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $975,000. This price reflects the product's potential and allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident that this is a win-win situation.",975000.0,Alice,5,
