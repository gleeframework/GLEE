``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a little higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. I'm confident that I can get at least $120 from Bob, but I want to see if I can do better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is too low for me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and go with $115? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice.  While $115 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not comfortable dropping below $110. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my last offer."
