Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've had enough of this negotiation, and I don't want to risk further lowering my price and ending up with a deal that's not worth it.  I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 and ensure I get the value I want for my product."
