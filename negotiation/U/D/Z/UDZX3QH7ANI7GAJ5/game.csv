"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to accept $950000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product is $1000000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $987500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",987500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $987500. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll offer $990000, which is still a compromise considering my original asking price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
