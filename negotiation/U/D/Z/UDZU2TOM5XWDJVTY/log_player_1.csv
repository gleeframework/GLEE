{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial price. How about $11,000? This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, $10,800 is a good deal considering we've reached a compromise.  There's a chance I could continue negotiating, but it's risky to push too hard, especially since John is willing to pay $10,000."
