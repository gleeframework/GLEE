Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and Bob's unique position to utilize it  justifies the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, showing Alice is willing to negotiate. 

By setting the initial price high, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal above her minimum acceptable price. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has the security of John's offer at $1,200,000."
