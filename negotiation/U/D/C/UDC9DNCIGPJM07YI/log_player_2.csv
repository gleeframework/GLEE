"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. I believe it has tremendous value and potential. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $1500000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to her, but she's offering it to me for $1,200,000. I think I can get a better deal elsewhere. I'll reject her offer and see what John has to say.
