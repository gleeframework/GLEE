"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price. How does $120 sound?  It's a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $120 is less than your maximum price of $150. 
* **You save money:** Buying from Alice saves you $30 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice benefits too:** While you save money, Alice still makes a profit ($120 - $80 = $40) which is likely a good outcome for her."
