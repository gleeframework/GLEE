"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the market demand. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that's closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This reflects the true value of the product, and it's a price that would make this a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $800,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to settle for anything less than $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've reached a point where further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to yield a price closer to my minimum. John is offering a guaranteed $800,000, which is exactly what I need.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer."
