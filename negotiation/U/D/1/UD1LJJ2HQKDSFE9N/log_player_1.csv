Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $15,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal for you, considering its value and potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This price is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to entice Bob to accept the offer. 

I'm starting with a higher price, but I'm open to negotiating and I have a backup buyer in John, which gives me flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product sounds interesting, but I was hoping we could discuss a lower price. Would you be willing to consider $12000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can bridge the gap a bit. How about $13,500?  This would still be a great price for you, and it would allow me to make this sale. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's interest and use positive language to encourage a deal. I also frame the counteroffer as beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $12500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's worth accepting this offer as it's only a little lower than my last counteroffer and significantly higher than what I could get from John. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Bob walking away and me having to sell to John is high."
