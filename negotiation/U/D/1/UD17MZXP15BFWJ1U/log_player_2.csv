Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $80 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly from her price.  It's unlikely she'll go down to $80, especially with the way she is phrasing her offers. It's better to cut losses now and buy from John at the price you know you can get."
