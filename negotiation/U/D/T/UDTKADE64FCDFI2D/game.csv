"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $850000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $700000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $775000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $775000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to go up to $750000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $760000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent discussing it. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,5,
