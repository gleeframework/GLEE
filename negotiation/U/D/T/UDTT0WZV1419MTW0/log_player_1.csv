{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $9,500 is better than nothing, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $10,200? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's a good deal, and it's unlikely I can get much more from Bob.  I'll accept the offer to secure the sale."
