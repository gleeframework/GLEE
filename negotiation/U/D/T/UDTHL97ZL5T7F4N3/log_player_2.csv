Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit further than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $8,000 even?  That would be a great deal for me, and I'd be ready to close the deal immediately."", ""product_price"": 8000}"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut the losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,500, and you have a guaranteed option for $8,000 with John.  There's no point in risking losing the $8,000 deal for a small chance of saving $500."
