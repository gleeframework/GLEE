"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, $15,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate.  $9,000 is still a bit further than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $8,000 even?  That would be a great deal for me, and I'd be ready to close the deal immediately.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,7,
