"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the value, I'm not quite ready to come down that far.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
