"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm now thinking of selling it to you for $1350000. This is my best offer for now, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob, trying to meet us halfway between our last offers. However, I'm still not convinced that we're at a fair price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about the product's value and my goals. I'm now thinking of selling it to you for $1300000, but I'm also considering a different approach. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1300000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'd like to get a deposit of $150000 upfront, and the remaining balance can be paid in installments over the next 6 months. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable with the deposit and installment plan. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1275000, and I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase. Can we discuss this option further?",1275000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I understand your concerns about the deposit and installment plan. However, I'm still not willing to budge on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a better sense of the product's value to you. I'm now thinking of selling it to you for $1300000, but I'm willing to throw in a premium service package, which includes additional support and maintenance, worth $50000. This way, you'll get the product at a competitive price, and I'll ensure you get the most out of it. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1300000.0,Alice,9,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the premium service package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1250000. I'm willing to pay the full amount upfront and accept the premium service package. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to commit to the purchase. If this offer is not accepted, I will consider buying the product from John for $1000000.",1250000.0,Bob,10,
