I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price with Bob, the negotiations are taking longer than I anticipated.  I'm concerned that I'll spend too much time haggling with Bob and miss out on the opportunity to sell to John at a guaranteed price."
