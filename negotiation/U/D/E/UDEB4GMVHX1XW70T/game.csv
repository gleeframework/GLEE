"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $850,000.  It's a steal considering its value to you. I'm confident you'll see this as a great opportunity. Let me know what you think!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  Given the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  That's a significant discount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  While I value your interest, $725,000 is still a bit below what I need. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $737,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",737500.0,Alice,5,
