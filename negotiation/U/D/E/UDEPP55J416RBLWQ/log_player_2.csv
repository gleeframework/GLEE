"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $18,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer.  It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation while staying well below my maximum budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $15,000 is still more than I want to pay or need to considering John's offer. It's time for another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

This counter-offer:

*  **Is firm:** The ""final offer"" language signals I'm serious. 
* **Is my limit:** It matches John's offer, so I'm not incentivized to go higher.
* **Might be acceptable to Alice:** It's a reasonable price, and she might prefer to avoid losing the sale entirely."
