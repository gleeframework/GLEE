Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, Alice wants to get as close to that price as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately lowball the price."
