{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 initially gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not starting at the absolute maximum to allow for a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **Setting a Clear Price:**  Providing a specific price avoids ambiguity and signals seriousness. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message highlights the product's potential value to Bob, making it more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to gauge his interest level and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **Counteroffer:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to pay $8500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $8,000.  Bob's offer of $8,500 is above this minimum.
* **Potential for a Better Price:**  I believe there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price if I counter-offer.  
* **Negotiation Power:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This gives me leverage to push for a slightly higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'll counter-offer Bob with a price closer to my target of $10,000.  I'll aim for a price that is still attractive to Bob while also allowing me to earn more than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I believe the product's value makes this a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer of $9,250 is exactly halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500.  This shows a willingness to compromise and be reasonable.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While this price is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This allows me to potentially earn more than selling to John.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions the offer as a fair deal for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I will analyze Bob's response to gauge his reaction to the counteroffer. 
* **Adjusting Strategy:** If Bob rejects the counteroffer, I will assess his counteroffer and determine whether to accept it, make a new counteroffer, or sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still a bit hesitant at $9250.  Would you be willing to do $8750?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Lost Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag on, potentially costing me time and potentially leading to a lower offer later.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept and Close:** I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal, ensuring I sell the product for a price higher than selling to John."
