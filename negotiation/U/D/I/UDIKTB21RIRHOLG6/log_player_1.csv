I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also considering John's offer of $150 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for $120, as that's below my minimum acceptable price. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product at $150. This is my minimum acceptable price and a fair compromise given Bob's previous offer."
