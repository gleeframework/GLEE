Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:**  By starting at $1,400,000, I have some space to potentially lower the price if Bob negotiates, without going below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Showcasing Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe the product is valuable, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below both my asking price and my minimum acceptable price. While I want to maximize my profit, accepting this offer would be a considerable loss compared to selling to John. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and my original offer reflects that.  I could consider coming down to $1,300,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). It shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again emphasizes the product's inherent value to justify the price, subtly nudging Bob towards the higher end of the price range. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By making this counteroffer, I maintain a position to negotiate further if needed, potentially settling somewhere between $1,200,000 (my minimum) and $1,300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches my minimum acceptable price and what John is offering. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and I risk losing him as a buyer entirely. It's a good business decision to accept this offer and secure the sale at my desired minimum."
