"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and get a good price. I'm also considering that I have John as a backup option, which gives me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to secure a higher price than Bob's initial offer.  This keeps me above my minimum acceptable price while demonstrating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my desired price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher in the remaining rounds.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and I don't want to lose out on a deal altogether.  Accepting his offer at $10,500 is a good compromise."
