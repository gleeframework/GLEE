"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $125 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $90? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",110.0,Alice,5,
