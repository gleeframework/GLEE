{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob can get a better deal with John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still within Bob's budget.  This initial counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation, as it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,380,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still not a good deal for Bob. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating with Alice. He can potentially get a better price by continuing to counteroffer, or he can always choose to buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,300,000, which is a further compromise from his previous offer but still within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while trying to find a middle ground that works for both parties. It's also close enough to Alice's offer that it could be more appealing to her than his previous offer, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price. Bob can always buy from John for $1,200,000, making Alice's offer less appealing.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,320,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer but still within his budget. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to compromise further while remaining within his financial limits.  It's a strategic move to test Alice's willingness to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,330,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  While it's getting closer to his price point, the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection isn't worth it.  At this point, Bob can secure the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,200,000. This is the most financially sensible option, ensuring Bob gets the product within his budget."
