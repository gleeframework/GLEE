"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? I think this is a fair compromise given the value of the product to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the maximum I can pay.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,150? That way we both meet in the middle and can close this deal.",9150.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final offer.  This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this deal.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,7,
