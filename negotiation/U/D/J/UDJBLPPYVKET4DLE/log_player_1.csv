Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 110} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to anchor the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value. Even if he doesn't accept $110, it sets a higher baseline for counteroffers.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The $110 price tag gives me some wiggle room to go down if Bob negotiates. This way, I can still aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($80) and John's offer. 
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing that I believe it's a great deal, I subtly imply the product is worth the asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, I believe I can still negotiate a better price from Bob. He's clearly interested in the product, and his counteroffer wasn't outrageously low. This suggests there's room for a compromise that gets me closer to my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle"", I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us. This can encourage Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a noticeable concession from my initial offer ($110 to $100), which signals flexibility. However, I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than both Bob's initial offer and my backup option with John. 
* **Clear Target:** Offering a specific price ($100) gives Bob a concrete number to consider and helps move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $100. How about $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $95 is a very good offer, exceeding my minimum price and John's standing offer. 
* **""Highest I'm Willing to Go"":**  Bob's language suggests he's unlikely to move much higher. Pushing further risks losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a good offer now ensures a profit and allows me to move on to other potential sales."
