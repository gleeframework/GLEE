Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know John will buy the product for $150, that's my safety net.  I want to start by offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but potentially negotiable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $170 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and I can potentially still get a better price than selling to John. 
* **""Think you might be interested"":**  This phrasing avoids pressuring Bob, potentially making him more receptive.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. I could have started with a lower price closer to $150 to encourage a quick sale. The optimal strategy depends on how much risk I'm willing to take and how much I prioritize a quick sale versus a potentially higher profit."
