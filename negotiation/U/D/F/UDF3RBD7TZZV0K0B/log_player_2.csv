"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept Alice's offer of $900,000. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, which is why you should reject her initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $800,000.  Offering $750,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly lower price.  There's a good chance that if you reject the offer, Alice will counter with a higher price, so accepting her offer now is the best choice."
