Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not by a huge margin. This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $9,500 is still above your minimum of $10,000. This allows for room for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is friendly and straightforward, emphasizing the value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's below what you value the product at.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently come in below my minimum price. While $8,750 is closer to my minimum than his previous offers, it's still a significant loss for me.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000.  This ensures that I meet my minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
