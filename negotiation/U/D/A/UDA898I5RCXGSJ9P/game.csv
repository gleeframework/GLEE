"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $950000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While the product sounds intriguing, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to propose a price of $700000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $825000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $825000 is closer, I'm still a bit too high. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer $762500.  This seems like a fair middle ground, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $762500. I'm willing to meet you at $787500, which is still a compromise, but closer to my initial asking price. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  $787500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to budge a little more. Let's try $775000. This feels like a solid compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're still in the conversation, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $775000. I'm willing to meet you at $790000, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's closer to the product's true value. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit high at $790000.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to go up to $780000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can agree to it.",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $780000. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's the closest we can get to the product's true value. I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to budge, so this is my final offer. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,9,
