"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I believe it presents significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer of $11,000 is better than John's offer of $12,000.** This is a good price for Bob, and it's likely that Alice won't come down much further.
* **There's a risk in rejecting Alice's offer.** If Bob keeps rejecting, Alice might get frustrated and decide to sell to someone else. 
* **Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing it.**"
