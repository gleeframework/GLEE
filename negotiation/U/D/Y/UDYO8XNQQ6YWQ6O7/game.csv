"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to let it go for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $80?,80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $115. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $110. It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,7,
