"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value.  To move this forward, I can go down to $1,400,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, while also allowing you to make a profitable sale.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1,250,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and brings us closer to a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. To make progress, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a considerable increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
