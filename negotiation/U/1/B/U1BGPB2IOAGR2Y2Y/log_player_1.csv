Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my guaranteed price from John creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle somewhere between $800,000 and $950,000. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the product's inherent value aims to justify the high price point to Bob.

By starting with a strong offer, I increase the chances of either a quick sale at a high price or a negotiation that still lands above my guaranteed sale price with John."
