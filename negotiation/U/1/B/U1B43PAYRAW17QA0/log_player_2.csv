"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has a lot of potential value for your company.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely negotiate a better price than $1,000,000. It's too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, which leaves room for negotiation.
* **Not Insulting:** While low, it's not an unreasonably low offer considering Alice's valuation of the product. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That gives us both some room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but we can still get a better deal. $925,000 is a significant drop from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Move:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate by increasing the previous offer substantially.
* **Aim for the Middle Ground:** We're aiming for a price somewhere between the current offer ($925,000) and our previous counteroffer ($650,000).
* **Maintain Leverage:**  We're still a good distance from our maximum budget, which gives us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway at $825,000. It's a significant concession on my end, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

While $825,000 is a reasonable offer, we're consistently moving closer to a price that's good for both of us.  There's still room to negotiate, and we haven't reached a point where going with John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000.  I believe that's a strong offer, and it shows how serious I am about acquiring this product."", ""product_price"": 780000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Increment:**  This counteroffer increases the price by a smaller amount than before, signaling that we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Expressing Seriousness:** The message explicitly states our commitment to the purchase, which can encourage Alice to accept.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer keeps the pressure on Alice while still leaving us some room to potentially go slightly higher if needed."
