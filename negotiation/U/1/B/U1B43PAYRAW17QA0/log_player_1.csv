{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It has a lot of potential value for your company.  My asking price is $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price close to the midpoint of our perceived values ($1,200,000 for Bob, $800,000 for me). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a good price.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone helps establish a good rapport with Bob, making him more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob reinforces why this offer is attractive and worth considering. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm not setting a hard and fast price, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer and allowing for a more fluid negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we start at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates his interest. This means there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:** If negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $650,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  That gives us both some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, landing midway between my initial offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $650,000.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I clearly state that I'm willing to negotiate and am seeking a middle ground, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Positive Tone:** I continue the friendly tone to maintain a constructive dialogue.
* **Room for Negotiation:** By offering $925,000, I'm leaving space for further discussion and potential compromise without dropping below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $925,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant jump on my end, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $800,000 threshold. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Even though we're getting closer, Bob's offer suggests he's still willing to negotiate. There's likely room for a final counteroffer that might bridge the gap.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If this negotiation falls through, I can still sell to John for $800,000, ensuring I get a decent return.

**Next Steps:**  I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming to land at a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway at $825,000. It's a significant concession on my end, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Counter-Offer:**  I'm making my final counteroffer, aiming for a price as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price while leaving room for a possible compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000.  I believe that's a strong offer, and it shows how serious I am about acquiring this product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below minimum:** While Bob's final offer of $780,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation unlikely:**  It's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer significantly.  
* **Selling to John is the best option:**  Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees I meet my minimum price.  Even though it's not my ideal outcome, it's the best option to avoid a potential loss. 

By selling to John, I secure a fair price for the product and avoid potentially wasting more time in negotiations."
