"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, and I believe it's a great value for you too. Considering its worth to both of us, I propose a price of $95 for this product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $95 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying below our $80 maximum.  The tone is polite and suggests a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $80 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on the product while remaining competitive. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer now matches our target price, and there's no benefit in delaying further.  We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
