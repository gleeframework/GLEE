Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential extra profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that still leaves Bob with a perceived gain ($500 less than his perceived value).
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John or other buyers."
