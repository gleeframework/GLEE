"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my offer.  While $125 is closer, I'm still aiming for something below $100.  Would you be willing to do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While I can't go as low as $95, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
