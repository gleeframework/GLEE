Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000  creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity. It's significantly more appealing than his perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves me with a substantial profit.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently proceed with John, knowing I secured the best possible price."
