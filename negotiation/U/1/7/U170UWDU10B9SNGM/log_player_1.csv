"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a solid safety net if Bob doesn't come close to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and it's far below my initial asking price.  I'm going to reject this offer and counter with my own."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000.  This is still a good amount for me, but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up in his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's tempting to take $1,100,000, it's still below my minimum. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,500,000 yet. I'm going to reject this offer and try to close the deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,400,000. This is a significant reduction, but I'm still confident I can get a good price. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get me to my desired price.  It's better for me to take John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 and move on."
