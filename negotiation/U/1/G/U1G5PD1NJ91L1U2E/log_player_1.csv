Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's valuable to you, and to ensure a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting with a higher offer of $1,900,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit. 
* **Sense of urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is the same) might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Politeness and clarity:**  The message is framed politely and directly to encourage a positive response from Bob. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  There's always a risk that Bob might reject a high offer outright. A different approach could involve a slightly lower initial offer to increase the chances of acceptance."
