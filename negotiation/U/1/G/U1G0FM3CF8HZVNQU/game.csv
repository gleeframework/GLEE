"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $80 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  However, $140 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $90? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $115?  That's my final offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
