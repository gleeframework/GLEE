"Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still above your maximum price point. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance you can get a better deal by counteroffering, and you always have the option to buy from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's also still below my maximum price point of $120, leaving room for potential compromise.  This offer is a starting point for further negotiation and leaves the possibility of a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her current offer of $125 is still above my maximum price point of $120.  At this point, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal with John. This avoids further negotiation and ensures I get the product at my desired price."
