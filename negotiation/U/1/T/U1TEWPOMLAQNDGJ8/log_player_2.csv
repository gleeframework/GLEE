Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
