"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $12000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $14000? It's a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to go up to $13000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. How about we meet at $14500? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",14500.0,Alice,5,
