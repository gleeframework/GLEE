"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,700,000.  This price reflects the significant value it holds and allows for a potential profit margin for you.  Consider this a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further.",1700000.0,Alice,1,
