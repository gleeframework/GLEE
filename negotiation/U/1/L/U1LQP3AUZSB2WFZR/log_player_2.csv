"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $1,250,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the realm of possibility considering Alice values the product at $1,500,000.  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there are still rounds left for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget but still wants to save some money.  A counteroffer of $1,300,000 shows a willingness to compromise but also demonstrates Bob's determination to get a better price. This offer is a good balance between pushing for a lower price and potentially losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob's budget.  While the rounds are dwindling, Bob can still try to push for a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is nearing his budget limit but wants to secure the best possible deal.  Offering $1,350,000 is a significant increase from his previous counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise. This offer might be attractive to Alice as it's closer to her desired price point. The fewer rounds left increase the pressure on Alice, making her more likely to consider this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum budget. There are only a few rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will lower her price further. Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price, saving him money and avoiding the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially losing the deal."
