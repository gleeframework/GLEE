I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could sell to John now for $150, I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob before I settle for that."

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, I've had a few rounds with Bob and he doesn't seem willing to move much higher.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit, and it's a safer bet than continuing the negotiation."
