# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,500,000. That's way above my budget. I'll reject Alice's offer and look for a better deal elsewhere.
