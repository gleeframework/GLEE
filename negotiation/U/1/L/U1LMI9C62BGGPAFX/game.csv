"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm offering it at a starting price of $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done my research, and I believe that's a fair price for this product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is a very competitive price for the quality and benefits this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer to a realistic price point, I can't accept that low of an offer. To be fair, how about we settle at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $15,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,6,
