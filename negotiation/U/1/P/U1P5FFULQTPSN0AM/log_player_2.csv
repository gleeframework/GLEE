"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $100 to you. I'm proposing to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while ensuring a fair profit for me. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is below her perceived value, it's still more than the $100 you're willing to spend and the guaranteed $100 price from John.  You can likely get a better deal by rejecting her offer."
