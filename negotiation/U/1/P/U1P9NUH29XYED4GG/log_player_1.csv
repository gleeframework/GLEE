"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial asking price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This represents a considerable reduction on my initial offer and acknowledges the potential you see in it."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $800,000?  I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $800,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than what John is offering. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap and potentially secure a better deal than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,550,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while taking into account your interest in a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant move towards Bob's price while staying above John's offer. It signals a willingness to compromise while aiming for a strong final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I hope this shows how serious I am about purchasing this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly moving closer to my acceptable range, but I still believe there's a good chance I can secure a price closer to $1.5 million. Selling to John for $1.5 million is a guaranteed win, but I want to see if I can push Bob a bit further before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I can see you're serious about this purchase. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's latest, signaling firmness while still offering a compromise.
* **Time Constraint:**  With fewer rounds remaining, creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to accept this strong offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects this, I'm comfortable walking away and selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
