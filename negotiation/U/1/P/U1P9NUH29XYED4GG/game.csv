"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant value it holds.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial asking price is quite high for me. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This represents a considerable reduction on my initial offer and acknowledges the potential you see in it.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $800,000?  I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. Would you consider $1,550,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while taking into account your interest in a fair deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I hope this shows how serious I am about purchasing this product.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you increasing your offer. I can see you're serious about this purchase. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
