Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant profit for me while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making the offer more enticing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation, leaving the door open for a counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer keeps the pressure on Bob to make a deal. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully sold the product for a high price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still a profit for me, it's far below my ideal target. I'm not desperate for a quick sale, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I can use this to my advantage.
* **Plan B:** Having John as a backup buyer keeps the pressure on Bob, making him more likely to compromise.

**Next steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than my initial asking price, potentially around $1,350,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also preserving my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the significant value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price still offers you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise.  Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but staying within a profitable range.
* **Reiterate the product's value:** I remind Bob of the value he places on the product,  making my counteroffer more attractive.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, encouraging Bob to come back with another counteroffer if necessary.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a price that's close to my initial goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1300000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my ideal price of $1,350,000.  
* **Significant compromise from Bob:** Bob has clearly shown a willingness to negotiate and has already moved up from his initial $1,200,000 offer.
* **Risk of losing a better deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might end up having to settle for John's lower offer of $1,000,000.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a very profitable transaction."
