"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a good deal, it's still significantly more than half the price from John. There's room for negotiation with Alice, potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price, aiming for a substantial discount. This initial offer is likely to be rejected, but it sets a lower price point and signals my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $500,000 is still significantly more than half the price of John's offer.  There is room for further negotiation, especially considering I already made a counteroffer.  I will continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to my initial counteroffer of $400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from $400,000 to $450,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still seeking a significant discount. I believe this offer is more likely to be accepted than my previous one while still keeping a good amount of savings compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $550,000 is better than John's price, it's still more than half of John's offer. Alice has not budged much from her previous offers.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get her closer to my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $500,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This might be a good compromise point for Alice, given her previous offer of $550,000. It still represents a significant saving compared to John's price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging on her price.  She has gone back to her initial offer.  The negotiation is going in circles.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John.  While it's more expensive, it avoids further negotiation and frustration."
