Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $135 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal.

This approach allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $125?  That's still a fair price for you and within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to earn as much money as possible, and $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Counteroffer potential:** While Bob's offer is close to my bottom line, I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to negotiate further. 

I'm confident that by strategically counteroffering, I can increase the final price and get closer to my target of $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a little too low for me. How about $130?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets me keep this valuable product moving."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Fairness:** I'm presenting $130 as a ""fair price"" for both parties, emphasizing a win-win scenario. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, potentially closing the gap between our desired prices while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
