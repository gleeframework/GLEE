{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $11,500 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. This price is attractive to Bob (saving him $500) and highly profitable for you (a $3,500 profit over your minimum).

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters."
