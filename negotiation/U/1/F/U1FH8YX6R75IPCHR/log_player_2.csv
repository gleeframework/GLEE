Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to budge on your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $780,000. I'll make one more concession and lower the price to $812,500. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.

At this point, Alice has consistently met me halfway. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, there's a risk she becomes firmer in her stance and I end up having to settle for a price closer to $825,000. Accepting $812,500 secures a good deal, significantly below John's offer."
