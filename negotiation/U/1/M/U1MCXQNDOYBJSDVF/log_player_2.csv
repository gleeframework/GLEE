"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Let's make this deal work for both of us. How about we start at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $95 is too high.  Bob can likely get a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it,  let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to come up with a solution that works for both of us. How about we aim for a price of $90? This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. He's likely to be able to negotiate a lower price, especially given that Alice has already rejected one of his counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $87.50.  This is a fair price, given the value we both place on the product. "", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the value you see in the product, how about we settle on $89? It's a bit closer to your offer, while still reflecting the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $87.50. It's a reasonable price, considering Bob values the product at $120 and Alice's minimum is $80. Accepting this offer saves Bob $31 compared to buying from John, and it's a fair compromise."
