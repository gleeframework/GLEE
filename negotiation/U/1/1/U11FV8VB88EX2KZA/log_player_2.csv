"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high.  You're only willing to pay $12,000, and her offer is $18,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I am still hoping for a better price, so I will reject her offer. I believe we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price with a few more rounds of negotiations."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. I believe this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away with a positive outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,500, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high for me.  I've already reached my maximum price point of $14,500 and it's likely she won't budge much further.  I'm now considering my options, and I'd rather buy from John for $12,000 to avoid further negotiations and ensure a better deal."
