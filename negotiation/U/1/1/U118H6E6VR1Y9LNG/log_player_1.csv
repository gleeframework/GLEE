Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $14,500. I believe it would be a valuable addition to your inventory and am confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $14,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still presents a potential savings compared to my alternative offer. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the offer's limited nature and the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while mitigating the risk of him rejecting the offer and accepting the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
