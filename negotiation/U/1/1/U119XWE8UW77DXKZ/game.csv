"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're comfortable with, but still reflects the product's value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a little too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you closer to your target. I'm thinking of a price that's $50,000 above your offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
