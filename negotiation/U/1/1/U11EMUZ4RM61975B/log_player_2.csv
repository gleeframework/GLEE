"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $13500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $15,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $13,500.
* While this is a lower price than John's, you can still get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you are forcing her to potentially lower her price to get a deal with you. You are also signaling that you are willing to walk away, which strengthens your negotiating position."
