{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed sale of $1,000,000 with John allows you to aim high. 
* **Anchoring:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,900,000) sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be much closer to your initial offer.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning the ""immense value"" and ""game-changing potential"" without concrete details might pique Bob's interest and leave room for him to justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy is risky. There's a chance Bob might be turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential payoff for Alice is significant if the tactic is successful."
