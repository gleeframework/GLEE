Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for a product of this quality.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $8,250?  That's a good middle ground and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,375, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. This is my final offer, so I hope we can agree on this price.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,375 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,200? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,375, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,375 and $8,200, which is $8,287.50. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,287.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,287.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  John is offering the product for Bob's maximum, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price. It's best to avoid the risk and secure the product from John."
