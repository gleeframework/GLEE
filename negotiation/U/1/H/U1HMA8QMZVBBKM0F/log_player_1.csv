"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just under my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still allowing me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still holding firm above my minimum price point. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit more. I have several rounds left, and John is always a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still sticking to my minimum price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but I'm not willing to go below my threshold.  We are getting close to the halfway point and I need to see if I can get a deal or if I'll need to go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. We are in the second half of the negotiation, and I'm getting nervous about running out of time. I don't want to risk getting a lower offer or running out of rounds. Selling to John at this point guarantees me my minimum, so it's the safer option."
