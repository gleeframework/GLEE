"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $10500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Since I have 10 rounds, I can try to push for a better deal.  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,000? That's still a good deal for you, given the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's split the difference - how about $10750? This allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $10,750. The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  With 6 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $10,900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
