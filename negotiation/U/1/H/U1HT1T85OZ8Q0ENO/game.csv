"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're putting on the product, $11500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment.  I'd be happy to consider a price closer to $10500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11000? That's still a good deal for you, given the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Let's split the difference - how about $10750? This allows both of us to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  How about $10900?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10900.0,Alice,5,
