Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  This product is truly valuable and I believe a price of $13,000 reflects that value better."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product, but $13,000 is still outside my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This allows for a good deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. What do you think?
