Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's closer to my initial offer of $100. It's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure a sale."
