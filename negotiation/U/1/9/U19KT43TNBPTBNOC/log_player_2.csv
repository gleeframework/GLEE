"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, it's still above your ideal price point of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice. You can still get the product for a better price than John's, so it's worth exploring the negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within the range of what you're willing to pay. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing you to save money compared to buying from John."
