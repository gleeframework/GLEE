"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,300,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can we discuss this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both of our positions.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
