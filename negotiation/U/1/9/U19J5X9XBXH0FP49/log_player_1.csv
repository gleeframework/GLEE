"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired value. Selling to John at this point would mean missing out on potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,300,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I believe Bob can go a little higher, and I'm willing to negotiate further. Selling to John would mean missing out on a potential $50,000 profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $1,300,000.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that considers both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to get closer to $1,300,000, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,275,000, which would be $1,262,500. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,262,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,262,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,262,500 is slightly below my desired price, it's still a significant profit and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob, and  selling to John would be a lower profit.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best option at this point."
