{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while still ensuring a profit above John's offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,150,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential bargain for Bob. He gains a $50,000 advantage compared to your guaranteed sale with John.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is firm, the wording allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob if he's highly motivated but wants to negotiate slightly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
