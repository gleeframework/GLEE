"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and sharing your perspective on the value.  However, $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $11,500. This is a considerable reduction on my part and reflects my willingness to find a compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but $11,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle?  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. ",7500.0,Bob,4,
