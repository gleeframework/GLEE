"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $7,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",7200.0,Alice,3,
