"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  You can potentially save $500 by doing so."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to go down to $7,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $7,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $7,200 is a good deal.  It's lower than John's price, and you're saving $800 compared to your initial budget.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
