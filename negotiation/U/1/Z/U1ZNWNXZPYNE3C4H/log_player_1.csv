I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a significant profit over selling to John, but it's also a price that might be attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Higher Profit:**  A $500,000 profit is substantial.
* **Potential for More:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay even more.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

This offer balances maximizing my potential earnings with ensuring a good outcome even if Bob declines."
