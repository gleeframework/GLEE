"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your Value:** The product is worth $150 to you.
* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Alice.
* **Alice's Offer:** $135 
* **John's Offer:** $150

Since you can buy the product from John for $150, and Alice's offer is $135, it's still beneficial to reject Alice's offer.  You can still buy the product for less than your maximum value."
