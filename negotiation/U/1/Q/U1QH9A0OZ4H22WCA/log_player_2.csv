"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal, as the product is worth at least $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $15,000. There's a chance you can get a better price from Alice by rejecting her initial offer."
