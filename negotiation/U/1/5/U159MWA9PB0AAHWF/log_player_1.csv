"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $70 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $150 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I can go up to $85 but that's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $100. At this point, it's more profitable to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than continue haggling with Bob for a potentially marginal gain."
