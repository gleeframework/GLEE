"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, though, and I'd be happy to pay $9000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11000, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm comfortable paying $10000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000, Bob. I think $10000 is a bit too low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,5,
