"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested,  $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while ensuring you still make a good profit."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $13,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer, there's still room for negotiation to get closer to Bob's ideal price of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I'd like to make a slight adjustment to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I can offer you a price of $13,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The price is getting closer to Bob's goal:** $13,250 is within Bob's budget and not far from the $13,000 counteroffer. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:** There's a chance Alice will reject further counteroffers, and John's offer is still a fallback option.
* **The value is still good:**  $13,250 is significantly lower than John's $15,000 price.

While Bob might be able to push for a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further offers and having to buy from John makes accepting the offer the most logical choice at this point."
