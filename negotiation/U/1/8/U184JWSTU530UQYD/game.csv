"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This is the lowest I can go while still making this a worthwhile transaction for me. Let me know if you're interested.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $13,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. While $13,500 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $14,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",14250.0,Alice,5,
