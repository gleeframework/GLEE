"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's product is worth $12,000 to her, so Bob is aiming for a price just above that to ensure a deal is still beneficial for both parties.
* Offering $12,500 is a good starting point for negotiation, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000, making it a viable option.
* It's a good compromise, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer but still allows her to make a profit.
* Buying from John for $15,000 would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the better choice in this scenario."
