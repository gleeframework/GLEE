Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's aim for a compromise. I propose a price of $1025000 for the product. This price balances the value you see in the product with my need to recover costs. Please let me know if this works for you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is very close to your target price of $1,000,000.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further negotiations,  it's likely you'll only save a small amount. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for you while also preventing the risk of Alice walking away or you needing to buy from John at a much higher price."
