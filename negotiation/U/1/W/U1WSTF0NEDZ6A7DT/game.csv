"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. How about we go with $98?  It's a fair compromise, and gets us closer to a final agreement.",98.0,Alice,5,
