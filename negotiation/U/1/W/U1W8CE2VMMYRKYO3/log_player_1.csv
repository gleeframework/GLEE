Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation maximizes your chances of him accepting while securing a significant profit margin.
* **Time Constraint:** Adding a 24-hour deadline creates urgency and might encourage Bob to accept quickly.

**Why this strategy?**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Securing a Sale:**  A price too close to $1,000,000 might deter Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price significantly lower than $925,000 would leave potential profit on the table."
