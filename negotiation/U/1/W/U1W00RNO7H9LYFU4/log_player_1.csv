Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. It's better to take John's guaranteed offer at this point than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
