"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer.  There's a chance she's willing to go lower, and by rejecting, you open the door for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $100. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and gives her room to negotiate. If she rejects, we'll continue to refine the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my maximum, I'm still willing to push for a lower price. Alice has shown flexibility by lowering her offer, so I'm confident I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal. The difference between $110 and $115 is small enough that she might be willing to accept, especially if she's eager to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $112, which is within my price range and a decent discount from her initial offer. While I could potentially try for $111, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $120 is not worth it. This price feels like a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it."
