# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000.  It's more beneficial to cut negotiations and buy from John for $800,000."
