"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13000.  This still gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $12500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,4,
