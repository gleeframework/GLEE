"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment on my part.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price point.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to invest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment.",975000.0,Alice,5,
