"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's maximum budget is $800,000, and Alice is offering $1,000,000. 
* **Better alternative:** Bob can buy the product from John for $800,000, making it a more attractive option. 

Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to start a negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the value you see in the product, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating.  

Here's why:

* **Still too high:**  $950,000 is higher than Bob's maximum price of $800,000.
* **John is a better alternative:**  John is still willing to sell the product for $800,000, making John the better choice at this point.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to push for a lower price or accept John's offer if no better deal is possible."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant investment on my part.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price point."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to invest in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go below $975,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I've put into the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** $975,000 is above Bob's budget of $800,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, making it a more financially sound choice for Bob.

While Bob could continue negotiating with Alice, there's a risk that the price won't come down to a point where it's beneficial for him.  John's offer provides a guaranteed solution that fits within Bob's budget."
