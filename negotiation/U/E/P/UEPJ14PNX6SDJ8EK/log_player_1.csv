Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for bargaining and gives the impression that the product's value is even higher. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Fallback Option:** Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80. This knowledge empowers you to confidently negotiate with Bob for a potentially higher price."
