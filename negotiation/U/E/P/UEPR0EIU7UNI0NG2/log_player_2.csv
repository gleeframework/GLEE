"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $1,050,000. Since Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, it's worth trying to get closer to his target price.  Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still looking to get it for $1,075,000.  This represents a good deal for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
