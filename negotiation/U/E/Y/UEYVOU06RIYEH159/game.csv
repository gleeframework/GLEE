"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm open to further negotiations. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and it's the maximum I can afford at this time.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'll offer $975,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
