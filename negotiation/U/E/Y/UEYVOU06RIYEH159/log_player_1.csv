Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
