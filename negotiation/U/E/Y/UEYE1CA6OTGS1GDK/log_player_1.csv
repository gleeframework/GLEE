Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) and my minimum value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed while still earning a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting Bob's offer for $140 is the best option here. This is because:

* **It's above my minimum value:** I'm still making a profit of $10.
* **Selling to John only nets $10 more:** The extra $10 from John isn't worth risking losing Bob completely, especially since I'm already within my desired profit margin.
* **Counteroffering might backfire:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, leaving me with only John's offer, which is only slightly better."
