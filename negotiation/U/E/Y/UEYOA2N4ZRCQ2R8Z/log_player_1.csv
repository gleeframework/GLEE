Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price, and $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise and still leaves you with a significant profit margin."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can get to that number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no higher. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better offer from Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $990,000, which is $985,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can get to that number. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $985,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable value and  it's the best deal I'm likely to get from Bob at this point.  There's a risk that he might reject my counteroffer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
