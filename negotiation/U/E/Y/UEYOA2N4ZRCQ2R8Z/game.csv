"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's a fair compromise and still leaves you with a significant profit margin.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can get to that number.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but no higher. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $990,000? This is a fair compromise and a good investment for you. I'm confident you'll find this product valuable to your business.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980,000 and $990,000, which is $985,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can get to that number.",985000.0,Bob,8,
