"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. This product holds value for me, but not at that level. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. While I understand your perspective,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I could consider coming down to $1,400,000. This feels like a more reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,400,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this discussion. I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $700,000 is still below what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch, but I'm ready to make a move to secure this deal. Would you be willing to settle at $800,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair offer considering the current market.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,6,
