"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's say $110? This gives you a good deal, and allows me to get a good price for my product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $110 is less than John's price of $150, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($80). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
