"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a valuable asset, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing my profit margin.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the best I can do without losing too much profit.",795000.0,Alice,7,
