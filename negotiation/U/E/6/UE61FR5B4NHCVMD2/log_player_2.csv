"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to me, $75 is a good price. However, there is room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better deal.  I'm aiming for a price that's still within my budget but offers Alice a decent margin from her own cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at the point where I'm comfortable accepting.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can push for a lower price. There's still room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get it for closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 68}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still aiming for a price that's favorable for me.  This small increase might be enough to convince Alice to accept, especially considering that I'm nearing my maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $72 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  I've already made multiple counteroffers, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John for $100.  It's better to secure the product now at a price that's still advantageous for me."
