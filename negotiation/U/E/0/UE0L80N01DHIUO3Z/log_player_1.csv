Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price higher than that, leaving room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob sees value beyond his initial estimate. 
* **Leaving room for profit:** Offering it at $125 ensures a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **Balancing profit and the risk of losing the sale:** A price too close to $150 might scare Bob away, leading to selling it to John for the same price but missing a potential opportunity for higher profit."
