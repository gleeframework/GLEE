Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $110 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing him completely."
