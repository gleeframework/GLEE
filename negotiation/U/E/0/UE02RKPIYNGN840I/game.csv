"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,050,000 is still out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  I'll accept $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, and my final one.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's finalize this agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
