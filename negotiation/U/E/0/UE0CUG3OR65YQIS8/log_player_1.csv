Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the $950,000 offer is still too low for me to accept.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but no higher. I believe this is the maximum I can afford and still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $975,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum selling price and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
