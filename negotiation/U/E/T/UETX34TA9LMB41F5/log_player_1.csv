This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired $1,500,000, but if Bob rejects, we can work our way down.  It's important to remember John is always a backup option, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a bit more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with him. I'll try to push for a price closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that's closer to my valuation of the product. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to $1,500,000, I believe this is a good deal. Bob is willing to pay significantly more than his initial offer, and it's only $50,000 less than John's offer. It's unlikely I'll get a better offer from Bob, and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer altogether."
