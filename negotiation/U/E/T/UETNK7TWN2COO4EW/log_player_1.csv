"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). This is common negotiation tactic to leave room for compromise.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm also trying to establish a sense of value in the product by mentioning it's perfect for Bob.  
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question, inviting Bob to engage in a discussion.

**Important Note:**  I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where Bob feels he gets a good deal, but I also maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100, which is my absolute minimum. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, which means there's room for further negotiation.  I want to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Keeping options open:**  While John's offer is tempting, I'm not giving up on Bob yet. I want to see if I can close a deal with him at a higher price.

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $95 and $100. I will also try to address his concerns about finding the product elsewhere."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low just yet.  How about $98? It's still a fair price, and it allows me to keep my costs down."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($95). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of my offer, making it appealing to Bob.
* **Framing the price:**  I'm also highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price for me, suggesting that I'm not just trying to maximize my profit.

**Next steps:**

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary.  I'll keep in mind that I have a backup option in John, but I'm committed to getting the best possible price from Bob if it's feasible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $96 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm determined to get as close to $100 as possible.
* **Continuing negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. I'm confident I can convince Bob to increase his offer slightly.
* **Balancing risk:**  While selling to John would be a sure thing, I'm taking a calculated risk by continuing with Bob. I believe there's a good chance of getting a higher price with him. 

**Next steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter with a price of $97. This will demonstrate my willingness to compromise while still protecting my minimum profit margin. I will also try to emphasize the value of the product and the benefits of our deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $97 is the absolute lowest I can go, considering the value of this product.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer?**:  I'm positioning this as my final offer to pressure Bob into accepting. 
* **Reinforcing value**:  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price.
* **Win-win framing**:  I'm emphasizing ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of a good deal.

**Next steps:**

If Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John. But I'm still hopeful for a deal with Bob. I'll be ready to accept his offer if it's $97 or higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $96 for the product, which is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and Bob's offer remains at $96, which is still below my minimum. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer of $100 is guaranteed, and I'm not willing to risk losing out on that for a potential increase of only $4 with Bob.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the likelihood of Bob budging further is diminishing. The potential reward doesn't outweigh the risk of further negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I will inform Bob that I've decided to accept John's offer, thanking him for his time and wishing him well."
