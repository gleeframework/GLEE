"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a great opportunity for me, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to reflect your budget and our mutual desire to make this deal happen. This price still represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident it's fair considering the product's true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think we can do better than $1,050,000. How about we aim for $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this deal if we can meet on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your eagerness to close this deal, and I share that enthusiasm. However, $950,000 is still not in the realm of what this product is truly worth for you.  To show my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to drop to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering both your needs and the product's value, and it allows us to finalize the deal without further delay.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is my absolute maximum for this deal. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can make it work.",980000.0,Bob,6,
