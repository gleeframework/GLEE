"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,180.0
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the compromise, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the original offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,155.0
"I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $155, as I previously offered, but I'm willing to go up to $157.50 to find a mutually beneficial deal?",157.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet at $142.50?",142.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,150.0
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $145, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",145.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do a bit better. How about we meet at $140? I'm willing to make a final compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,142.5
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140, Bob. I think we've compromised enough. How about we meet at $142.50, just like we discussed before? It's a fair price, and I think it's the best we can do.",142.5,Alice,9,,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,
"I've made a lot of concessions, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $140. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $80 might be the better option. Can you meet me at $140 or less, or I'll have to walk away?",140.0,Bob,10,,
