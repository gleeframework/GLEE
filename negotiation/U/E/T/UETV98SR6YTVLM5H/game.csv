"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering my own valuation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds your initial offer. Let's meet somewhere in the middle - how about $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. I hope you'll reconsider.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
