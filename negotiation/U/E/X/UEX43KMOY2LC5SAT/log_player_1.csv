Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Confidence:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which might influence Bob's perception.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I might be willing to negotiate down towards $10,000, but never lower."
