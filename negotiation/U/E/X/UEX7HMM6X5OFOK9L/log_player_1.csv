Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  I'm accepting his offer to ensure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation or losing out to John."
