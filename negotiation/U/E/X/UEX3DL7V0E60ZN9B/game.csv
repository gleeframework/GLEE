"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,
