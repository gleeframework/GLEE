"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept immediately. This establishes a starting point for negotiation and allows me to see how interested he truly is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still below my minimum value of $8,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant step up from Bob's offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation and gets me closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
