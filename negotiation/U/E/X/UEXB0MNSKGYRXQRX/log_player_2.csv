"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Unknown:** We don't know what the product is worth to Alice, so there's a chance she's willing to sell it for less than $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Rejecting the initial offer allows us to start negotiating. 
* **No Risk:**  Buying from John is a guaranteed price, but we have 10 rounds to potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This counteroffer starts the negotiation with a substantial discount, showing a willingness to negotiate but also establishing a strong starting point.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $7,000 leaves room for Alice to counteroffer, allowing for a potential meeting point in the middle. 
* **Time Management:** We have 10 rounds, so we can afford to start with a bold offer and see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress Made:** Alice has already lowered her price, indicating she wants to make a deal. 
* **Further Negotiation:** While $9,000 is closer to our maximum, there's still room for further negotiation to potentially get a better price.
* **Limited Rounds:** We still have time to negotiate without needing to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($9,000). It signals a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Remaining Rounds:** We still have several rounds left, so we can afford to be patient and see if Alice will meet us in the middle.
* **Value Uncertainty:** We still don't know Alice's bottom line, so there's a chance she might accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."
