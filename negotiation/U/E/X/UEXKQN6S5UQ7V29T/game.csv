"Alice, your offer is too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,700,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,700,000 is certainly appealing, I believe this product holds even greater value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering its potential worth.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product has greater value, but I'm still not comfortable with $2,000,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
