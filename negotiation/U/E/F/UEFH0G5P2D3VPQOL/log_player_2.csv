"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While $120 is less than Alice's value, it's still more than your $80 limit and more expensive than buying from John. You can do better!"
