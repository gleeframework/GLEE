"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  That gives us both a bit of room to compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500. That's the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I understand you have a limit.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price that shows I'm willing to work with you, and it's still closer to my value than your last offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $9,500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to know you're serious about selling it to me. Can you do that?",9500.0,Bob,6,
