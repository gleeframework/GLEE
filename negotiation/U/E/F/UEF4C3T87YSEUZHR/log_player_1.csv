{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **""Amazing product"" and ""very interested in""**: These are positive phrases that aim to pique Bob's interest and make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **""What do you think?""**: This keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's not happy with the initial price.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** I want to start with a price that is close to my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Being open to counteroffers:**  By inviting Bob to counter-offer, I can learn his true willingness to pay.
* **Maintaining the option to sell to John:** I'll be prepared to walk away from the deal with Bob if his counteroffers are too low and John is still a viable option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation, where I'll make a counteroffer. 
* My goal is to try and get closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation open. 
* I'll need to be careful not to push Bob too hard and risk losing him as a buyer altogether."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500?  That gives us both a bit of room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **""Gives us both a bit of room to compromise"":** This language further emphasizes my willingness to negotiate and makes the counteroffer feel like a collaborative step.
* **$10,500:**  This price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my starting price, making it a reasonable counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

* By making a reasonable counteroffer, I aim to keep the negotiation moving and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to pay more by proposing a price that is higher than his initial offer but lower than my previous offer.
* If Bob accepts this offer, I can secure a decent profit while still selling the product. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate until I reach an acceptable price or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.
* I need to be mindful of potentially pushing Bob away with too aggressive a counteroffer, but I also need to be firm about my minimum acceptable price. 
* I'll continue to assess the situation and weigh Bob's offers against my opportunity cost of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I understand you have a limit.  $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price that shows I'm willing to work with you, and it's still closer to my value than your last offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Show willingness to work:** I acknowledge Bob's limit, but reaffirm my own. I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price, showcasing my willingness to collaborate.
* **""Fair price"":** This language appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to see the offer as a reasonable middle ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize that the price is still closer to my value than Bob's last offer, subtly reminding him of the potential value he'll be getting. 
* **$10,000:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,500 and Bob's offer of $9,500, aiming to keep the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* It aims to gauge Bob's true commitment and willingness to pay a higher price.
* If Bob accepts, I'll secure a price that's closer to my desired value than his initial offer. If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close to walking away, but I still think $9,500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to know you're serious about selling it to me. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's persistence shows he's interested, $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. It's clear that we're unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price. Considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay my minimum, it's more beneficial to sell to John.

**Strategy:**

* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would likely result in more time wasted and further price reductions. 
* **Capitalizing on a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Minimizing loss:** While selling to John means missing out on the potential to earn more from Bob, it prevents a potentially significant loss by accepting a price that's too low for me."
