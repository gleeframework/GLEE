Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price of $80, but it also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.
* **The message** is friendly and highlights the value of the product to Bob. 
* **This strategy:**
    * Aims to maximize profit.
    * Avoids immediately going for the highest possible price (which could lead to Bob walking away).
    *  Keeps the door open for further negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $100 is better than selling to John, I can still potentially get closer to my ideal price of $120. 
* **Reasoning:** I believe I can get Bob to pay closer to my initial offer by counter-offering.
* **Next steps:** I'll counter-offer Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $100 and $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price of $120. Would you be willing to go to $110?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of this product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $110 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I'm trying to remain friendly and positive while also expressing my desire for a higher price. I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get and suggesting a fair compromise. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make a decision soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's offer:**  $105 is a good compromise and significantly higher than selling to John for $80. 
* **Reasoning:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $120, Bob has shown he's unwilling to go higher than $105. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether, leaving me with only the $80 option from John. 
* **Next Steps:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale, securing a good price for the product."
