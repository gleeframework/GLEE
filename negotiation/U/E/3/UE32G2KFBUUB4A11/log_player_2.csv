"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and rarity, it's worth noting that this product holds a significant significance to me, valued at $12,000. However, considering your appreciation for its worth, I am extending an offer to you at a price of $11,000. This is a special opportunity tailored to recognize your discerning taste and commitment to excellence. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $10,000. She's already offering a price that's above her personal value.
* **Bob's Budget:** Bob has a maximum budget of $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, which is Bob's maximum.

Since Bob can buy the product from John for $12,000, rejecting Alice's offer at $11,000 allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy from John at his maximum price."
