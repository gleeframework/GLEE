I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price from him. $950,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can do better."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price,  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This leaves some room for both of us to benefit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in risking further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
