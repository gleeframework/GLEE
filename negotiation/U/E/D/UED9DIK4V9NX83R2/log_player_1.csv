Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net.  This allows Alice to aim high with Bob.

**The message also emphasizes:**

* **Exclusivity:**  This can make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Value to Bob:** By highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob, it reinforces his potential gain."
