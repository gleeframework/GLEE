"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can do better by counter-offering. While it's tempting to buy from John, you have more room to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a strong offer, the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. I believe this price point represents a fair balance.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for me. I believe I can get it for even less by continuing to negotiate. I'm also not desperate enough to buy from John right now."
