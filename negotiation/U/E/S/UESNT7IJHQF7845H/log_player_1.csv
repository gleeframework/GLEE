{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000).  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is still a good deal for me, I'm confident I can get closer to my asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $7,000 is a little lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another offer of $7,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer of $7,500 is still a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm not confident I can push him higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000, which is a guaranteed profit for me."
