"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it right now at that price.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a fair price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I've already compromised a lot by coming down to $140 earlier. I'm willing to meet you at $130, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
