Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a relatively high price, hoping to maximize my profit. I'll gauge Bob's response and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try and get a better deal. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to reduce my price slightly, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling to him, but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still aiming for a profit above my minimum.  I'm hoping Bob sees this as a genuine attempt to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers are getting too low, and while I could keep negotiating, I'm worried I'll end up with a price that's too close to my minimum, or even lower. John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk losing that for the chance of a slightly higher price from Bob."
