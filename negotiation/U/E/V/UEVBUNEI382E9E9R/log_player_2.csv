"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $90 is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so you're hoping to negotiate a better price with Alice or use John's offer as leverage."
