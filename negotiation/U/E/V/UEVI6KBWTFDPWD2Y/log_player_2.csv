"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $850,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. The product is only worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $850,000 might be a bit steep, but I believe the product is worth more than $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $775,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum value of $800,000. Continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $760,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not comfortable going any higher.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 760000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $765,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting close to your maximum value, and you only have 5 rounds left.  Accepting Alice's offer for $765,000 is a good compromise, especially since you're getting a slightly better price than what John would offer."
