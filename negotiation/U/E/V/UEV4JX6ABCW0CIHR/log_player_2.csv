"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $110. While that's a good price, it's still above your ideal price point. You have the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer is the best strategy for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. Offering $105 is a good compromise, as it's a decent discount from Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product while also giving Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is a good deal for you. It's lower than your initial counteroffer, and still within your acceptable price range of $120. It's a good balance of saving money and avoiding the risk of further negotiations leading to a higher price."
