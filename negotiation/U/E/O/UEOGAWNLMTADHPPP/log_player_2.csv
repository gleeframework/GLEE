"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Even though $100 is less than our maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Alice starts high, so we should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still a reasonable markup from her value ($80). This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive tone, expressing interest while clearly stating our price limit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Our counteroffer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's value while still leaving us with potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $92.50?  This would still be a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room:** While Alice met us halfway, $92.50 is still significantly above her value. We have room to negotiate further.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the safety net of John's offer, so we can afford to be a bit more assertive in our negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. $92.50 is closer, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about $88?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 88
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're edging up our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to compromise, but we're not jumping to her price.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason like a ""tight budget"" can make our position more relatable and potentially lead to further concessions from Alice. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We continue the negotiation to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair. $88 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $90? That's only $2 more than your last offer, and I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While we could likely negotiate a few more dollars off, Alice is clearly getting closer to her bottom line. The potential savings at this point are getting smaller.
* **Time Investment:** We've already spent several rounds, and there's no guarantee Alice will go much lower. Accepting now secures a good price without risking a stalemate. 
* **Good Deal:** $90 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $120 and a fair price overall."
