Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher price of $175 allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $175 offer isn't ridiculously high, leaving room for Bob to potentially negotiate down. Even if Bob negotiates, you're still likely to sell it for more than your minimum.
* **Polite and Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and suggests the offer is a ""great deal,"" encouraging Bob to consider it. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still maintaining a good chance of making a sale to Bob."
