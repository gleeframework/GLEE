Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.
* **Psychology:** A slightly higher initial offer can sometimes make the product seem more desirable or exclusive."
