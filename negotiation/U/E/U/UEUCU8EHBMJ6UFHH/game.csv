"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant returns you'll gain.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,800,000 is below its potential. I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the market value and the potential returns. Can you consider this offer?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. $1,900,000 is still too low. Let's settle this â€“ I'm willing to accept $2,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the potential this product holds.",2000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and the potential returns. Can you reconsider?",1950000.0,Bob,6,
