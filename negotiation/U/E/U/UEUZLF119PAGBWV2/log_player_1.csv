"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a strong opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to start high and then be willing to lower the price gradually if necessary.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, there's a good chance he might be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer. I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for more. $9,750 is too low.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can push him further in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm making a final push with a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum.  If Bob is genuinely interested, he should be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  While his offer is getting closer,  I've only got 4 rounds left and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum. It's time to secure the $10,000 from John."
