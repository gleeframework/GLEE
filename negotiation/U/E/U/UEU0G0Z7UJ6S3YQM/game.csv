"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1275000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  $1225000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  I'll offer you the product for $1240000.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price for the value it brings to your business.",1240000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're feeling the pressure of time, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1240000. I'm still at $1225000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
