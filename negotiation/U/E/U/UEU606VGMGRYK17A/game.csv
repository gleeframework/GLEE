"Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $14000, but I'm still struggling to meet that price. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll meet you halfway between $14000 and $11000, which is $12500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
