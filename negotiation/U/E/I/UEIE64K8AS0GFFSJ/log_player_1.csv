Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value for both of us. While I want to reach an agreement, accepting such a low price would be a substantial loss. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects its inherent value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need us to find some middle ground here. Would you consider $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but $1,300,000 is still too low considering my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to push him closer to the $1,500,000 mark. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is still a touch high for me.  What if we split the difference and landed at $1,500,000 even? That would be my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I could negotiate a higher price with him, and waiting carries the risk of him reducing his offer. Accepting $1,500,000 now is the safest option to ensure a profitable deal."
