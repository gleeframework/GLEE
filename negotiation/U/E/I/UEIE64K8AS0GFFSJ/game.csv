"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product but could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects its inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need us to find some middle ground here. Would you consider $1,300,000? I think that's a fair offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle on $1,700,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,700,000 is still a touch high for me.  What if we split the difference and landed at $1,500,000 even? That would be my final offer.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
