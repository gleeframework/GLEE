"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening that sets the tone for a high-value negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.  If he rejects, we can continue to negotiate and I'll adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for improvement. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial ask. I want to see if I can get closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer. This should encourage him to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good deal. It's only $50,000 less than my initial offer and a significant amount higher than John's offer. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal quickly and get a good price for my product."
