"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'd like to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and leaves some room for us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so it makes sense to reject the offer and continue negotiating. There's still room to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I think this price is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made a significant concession, dropping her price to $875,000, which is getting closer to Bob's desired price of $850,000. Accepting this offer would mean a saving of $125,000 compared to buying from John. While a slightly higher price than Bob's ideal, it is still a significant saving, and Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
