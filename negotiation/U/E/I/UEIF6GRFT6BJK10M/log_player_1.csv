Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects its value to me and leaves some room for us both to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
