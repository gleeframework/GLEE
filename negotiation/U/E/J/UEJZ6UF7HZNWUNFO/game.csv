"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. Let me know what you think.",82.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $78?  That seems fair to both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $82.50 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $81.25. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. Let me know what you think.",81.25,Alice,5,
