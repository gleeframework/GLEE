"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is substantial, there's still a significant gap between his offer and his perceived value of the product. I believe I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant ROI. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?"",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $987,500?  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is very consistently splitting the difference. While $987,500 is a good offer, I think I can push him a little further by holding firm and countering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value this product brings.  Would you consider $1,010,000? I'm confident this would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1010000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,010,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to offer $995,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $995,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is consistently moving towards a middle ground, and while I believe I could push for a bit more, $995,000 is a strong offer. It's a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting now guarantees a successful sale."
