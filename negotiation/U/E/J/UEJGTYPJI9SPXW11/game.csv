,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant ROI. How about we meet halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $987,500?  This would give us both a good deal and allow us to move forward.",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on the value this product brings.  Would you consider $1,010,000? I'm confident this would be a fair compromise.",1010000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,010,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to offer $995,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",995000.0,Bob,6,
