"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That would be fair to both of us.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $98?",98.0,Bob,4,
