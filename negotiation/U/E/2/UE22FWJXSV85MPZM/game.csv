"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $975,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, but $975,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $1,025,000?  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal here. ",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final concession, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $995,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",995000.0,Bob,6,
