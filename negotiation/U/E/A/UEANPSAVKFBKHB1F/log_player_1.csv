"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value and uniqueness of the product to pique Bob's curiosity. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, signaling my willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate and potentially lower the price if necessary. If Bob rejects my initial offer, I'll use his counteroffer and the remaining rounds to assess his true value perception and make a strategic decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee of a better offer from Bob. Continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal entirely.
* **John's offer as safety net:** I have John's offer as a backup, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept a low price. 

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum acceptable price, which is a good outcome. It's a win-win situation and avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential loss."
