"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would that work for you?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $14,000 is still a little more than I had in mind.  How about $11,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. How about we meet at $13,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding.  $13,000 is close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you consider $12,500? That's the most I can offer. ",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. How about we meet at $13,200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",13200.0,Alice,7,
