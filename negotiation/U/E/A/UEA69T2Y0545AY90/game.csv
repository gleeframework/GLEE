"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value you place on this product, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your desire to stay within budget.  However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $862,500?",862500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value does not justify such a high price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. This seems to be closer to both our values and I believe it will allow us to reach a fair agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
