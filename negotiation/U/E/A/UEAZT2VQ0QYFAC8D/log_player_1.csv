Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its value to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message highlights the potential profit for Bob and emphasizes a fair deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,200,000, I have room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me leverage to stand firm if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can still negotiate with Bob and try to reach a more favorable price. 
* **John as a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,100,000? This would still give you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  While I rejected Bob's offer, I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that $1,100,000 still provides a good profit for Bob, keeping the focus on finding a mutually agreeable deal. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving me room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, how about $1,050,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for one more counteroffer:** I can still make a counteroffer and try to push for a price closer to my desired amount.
* **John as a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your compromise and I'm happy to continue working towards a deal. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a final attempt to reach a compromise with Bob.  It's a slight increase from his last offer, but still below my initial offer. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm again emphasizing the value to both of us, trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable for both parties.
* **Close the Deal:**  The message suggests that this is the final offer, hoping to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal. 
* **John as the Backstop:** If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John and secure the $1,500,000."
