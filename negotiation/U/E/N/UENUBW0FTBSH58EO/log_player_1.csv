"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price than Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing the deal's potential. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to signal my willingness to negotiate.

**Note:** This is just a starting point.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's counteroffer is low, it shows his willingness to negotiate. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Time to Counter:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer and hopefully close the gap. 

**Next Steps:** I'll carefully consider how much I can lower my price while still exceeding my minimum. I also need to factor in the number of rounds remaining and the risk of Bob walking away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still represents a significant value to you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's keep the conversation going."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Not Too Much:**  I've dropped my price by $800,000, demonstrating flexibility.  However, I'm still well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, stressing that my offer is still a good deal.
* **Open for More Discussion:** I'm signaling my willingness to continue negotiating and reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:**

* I'm balancing my need to get a good price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer.  
* I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) and don't need to settle for a price that's too low. 
* I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Budget Ceiling:** Bob has clearly stated his maximum budget of $800,000. This is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Time is Limited:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price is high.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is a much better deal than what Bob is offering.

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob, the limited time and the substantial price difference make it more logical to accept John's offer. This ensures I secure my minimum acceptable price and avoid potentially getting stuck with a lower deal."
