"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and your maximum valuation of the product. It makes sense to negotiate and see if you can get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer shows you're serious about getting a better price. It also gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Respectful Tone:** While firm, the message aims to keep the negotiation amicable and open to further discussion.
* **Strategic Anchoring:**  By throwing out a lower number first, you're attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $600,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still represents a significant value to you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, $1,200,000 is still considerably above your $800,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to negotiate downwards suggests there's still flexibility in the price.
* **Backup Option:** You have the security of buying from John at $800,000 if negotiations with Alice stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $800,000.  If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I may need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency:**  Being upfront about your maximum budget can help move the negotiation along. It signals that you're serious and eliminates guesswork for Alice. 
* **Firm but Fair:** You're sticking to your valuation while also indicating a strong desire to buy if your price can be met.
* **Introducing Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly introduces time pressure, potentially encouraging Alice to make a decision quickly."
