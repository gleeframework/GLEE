"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $800,000 to him, and Alice is asking for $1,200,000. This is a significant overcharge. Bob should counteroffer and try to get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,000,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his desired $800,000."
