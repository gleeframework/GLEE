"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest.  While $1200000 is my minimum, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $1350000? This would still be a good deal for both of us and allows us to move forward. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1350000 is closer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.
