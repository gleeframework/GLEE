"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle again?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and acknowledges your interest. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not quite there at $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your straightforwardness. While $1,225,000 is close, I can't accept it knowing its true value. To avoid wasting either of our time, I'm willing to land at $1,275,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $1,275,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer: $1,225,000. I'm confident that this is the best I can do, and I hope we can agree on this price.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
