Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 (your minimum acceptable price) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, getting you closer to your target.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price.
* **John as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned, the fact that you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives you a strong position.  You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
