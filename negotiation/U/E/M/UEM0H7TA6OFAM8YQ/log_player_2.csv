"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth that much to you as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly stating the product is worth the full $1,200,000 to you.  This leaves no room for negotiation or a lower price. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. By rejecting, you might motivate Alice to propose a lower price in a counter-offer."
