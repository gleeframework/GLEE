"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This price reflects its value and potential for your business. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value you mentioned, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your perspective. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise. I can accept $1,350,000 for the product. This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good price for Bob.  It's lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and is within Bob's budget.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer again and he'll end up having to buy from John.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
