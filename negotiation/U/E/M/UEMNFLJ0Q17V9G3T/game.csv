"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is still significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. But $950,000 is still significantly lower than the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $925,000 is simply not enough for this product.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000 one last time. This is a final offer.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll need to explore other options.",950000.0,Alice,7,
