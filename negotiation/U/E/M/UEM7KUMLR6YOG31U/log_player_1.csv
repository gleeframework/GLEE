I'm starting high, hoping to get as close to my minimum as possible.  I'm aware Bob values the product at $80, so he might counteroffer. We'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $100, $90 is still a good price.  It's higher than Bob's valuation, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially lowering the price.  I'm happy with this outcome."
