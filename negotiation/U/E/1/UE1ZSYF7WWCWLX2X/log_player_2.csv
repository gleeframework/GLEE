Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your initial offer, but $2,300,000 represents a significant discount from what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be frank, $650,000 is quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  If you're serious about purchasing, I could consider $1,600,000. This offer stands as a sign of good faith, but I do need to see some movement on your end as well.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate that you've raised your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to make one more compromise to close this deal. If you're willing to meet me at $1,350,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is dropping her price, but very slowly. Her latest offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer.  At this point, it's unlikely you'll negotiate a price with Alice that's significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds.  Cutting your losses and going with John's guaranteed price of $800,000 is the most financially sensible option."
