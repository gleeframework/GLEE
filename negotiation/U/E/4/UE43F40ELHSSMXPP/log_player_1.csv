"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Reasonable Starting Point:** It's a significant discount from your minimum, making it appealing to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message invites Bob to engage in a negotiation rather than presenting a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 
* **Highlights Value to Bob:**  Mentioning that the product is worth a lot to Bob reinforces his motivation to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a fair price considering the value this product brings you. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'd be willing to meet you at $9000. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, I still have some room for negotiation and potentially get a higher offer.  We're at the halfway point of the rounds, and I want to see if I can secure a better deal without risking selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. How about we split the difference?  $9,250.  That's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $9000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. Can you meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to accept $9,000 since it's a decent price, I'm still not at my minimum and there are only 4 rounds left.  I'm willing to risk losing a few more rounds and see if I can get closer to my target price of $12,000. Selling to John at this point would be a loss, and I'm hoping to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,100 as a final compromise. This is a great deal for you, considering the value this product brings you.  I'm not sure I can go lower than this. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my last offer, increasing the pressure to accept. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm offering a slight concession from my previous offer ($9,250) to show I'm willing to negotiate but not going too far below my desired price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds left, I'm creating urgency to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've already told you I'm not willing to go above $9000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, it's highly unlikely I'll be able to convince Bob to go higher than $9,000.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob that could lead to a lower offer."
