"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $15,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a compromise between our initial offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and I'm sure we can both agree on this compromise. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11200.0,Alice,5,
