Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a price significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""potential"" of the product without being too specific. This allows Bob to potentially justify the higher price in his own mind. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer doesn't explicitly mention your other buyer,  keeping your options open and potentially encouraging Bob to negotiate rather than outright reject the initial offer."
