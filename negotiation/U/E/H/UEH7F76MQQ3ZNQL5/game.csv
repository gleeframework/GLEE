"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm afraid $6000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $18000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",18000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that $12000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $16000? I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me there.",16000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid $15500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $15500 and $17000, which is $16250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",16500.0,Alice,9,,
