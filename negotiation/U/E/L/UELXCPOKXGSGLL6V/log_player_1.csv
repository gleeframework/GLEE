""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Reservation Price:** Your minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you need to aim for a price as close to Bob's valuation as possible without exceeding it. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $100,000, incentivizing him to buy from you. This price also nets you a significant profit over your reservation price."
