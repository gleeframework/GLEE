"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is way too high for me. I'm not willing to pay more than my maximum limit of $800,000.  I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my limit. I'm going to stick with my offer of $800,000 and see if she'll budge. I'm confident I can still close the deal within my budget, but I need to be patient and continue negotiating."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $950,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $800,000. It's been a fair offer from the beginning, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  If she continues to be inflexible, I can always choose to buy the product from John, as this price is within my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I've been consistent in offering $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. It's a fair price for a product that's valuable to me.  I believe this is the best option for both of us, allowing us to complete the transaction and move forward. Let's close this deal at $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000, as it's still below my minimum target. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still above my budget, and we've been through several rounds of negotiation.  While there's a chance she might come down to $800,000, I'm concerned that I'm running out of time and don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether.  I've already made it clear that $800,000 is my absolute maximum, and she's shown a reluctance to meet that. It's time to move on and secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll buy from John and avoid further potential complications."
