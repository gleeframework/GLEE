"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800,000, as it's below my minimum target. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. However, $950,000 is still beyond my budget.  I've been consistent in offering $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. It's a fair price for a product that's valuable to me.  I believe this is the best option for both of us, allowing us to complete the transaction and move forward. Let's close this deal at $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,6,
