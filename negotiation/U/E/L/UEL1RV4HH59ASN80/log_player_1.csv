"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price, as I want to maximize my profit. I know the product is worth at least $120 to me, and I'm hoping Bob values it higher.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if I can secure a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than my minimum, it's still lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price, and I have time to negotiate further. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I still want to get as close to my desired $180 as possible. This seems like a reasonable compromise, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $170,  $165 is a decent price and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for the much lower $120."
