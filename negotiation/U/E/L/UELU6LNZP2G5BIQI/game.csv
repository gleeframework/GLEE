"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900000. This is my final counteroffer, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $900000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can meet you at $885000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product.",885000.0,Alice,5,
