Round 2
Bob's offer:

While ideally I'd want a price closer to $1,400,000, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and we are getting into later rounds. Accepting at $1,380,000 secures a good profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a deal now than risk Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
