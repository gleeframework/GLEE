"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate. However, it also ensures I make a profit of at least $2,000, which is important as I have a minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is a decent price, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price point.  I want to see if I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to pay $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
