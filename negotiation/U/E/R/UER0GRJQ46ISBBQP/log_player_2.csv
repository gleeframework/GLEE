"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a game-changer, and I'm excited to share it with you. I'm thinking of a price of $9,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. I have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000 without risking going over my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can meet you in the middle at $8,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to her likely minimum, but there's still room to negotiate. I'll try a counteroffer a bit closer to her price to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a deal at $8,200. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to hold onto a decent profit margin. While I could try to negotiate further, $8,200 is a good price and saves me a significant amount compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
