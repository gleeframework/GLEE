"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower and any savings at this point are likely to be minimal. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
