This is a tough one, but it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each counteroffer is yielding smaller and smaller increases.  
* **Time Value:**  Dragging this out longer means potentially missing other opportunities. 
* **Psychological Factor:**  Accepting at $16,000 might leave Bob feeling like he got a slightly better deal, which can be good for future interactions. 

While holding out for more is tempting, the risk of losing the sale altogether increases."
