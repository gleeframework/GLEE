"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This price still offers you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another offer of $1,450,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
