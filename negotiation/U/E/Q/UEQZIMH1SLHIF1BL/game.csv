"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your cost and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,300,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
