"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value you've described.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value I believe the product brings. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best value for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's worth. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $875,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to move forward.  Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both our needs.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",920000.0,Alice,7,
