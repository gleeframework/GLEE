Round 2

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value I believe the product brings. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point. I'll reject her offer and try to get a lower price. I'm confident I can get it closer to $850,000, as that was my initial counteroffer."

Round 4

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best value for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's worth. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping to get it down a bit further. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price. I'm confident that I can get it down to my initial counteroffer of $850,000, or maybe even closer to $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $925,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $875,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget.  I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to move forward.  Let's work together to find a solution that satisfies both our needs."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my ideal price point, and the negotiation seems to be stalling.  I've made several counteroffers and it's not clear if we're going to reach an agreement.  Rather than risk further rounds and potentially missing out on the product altogether, I'm going to take John's offer at $800,000. It's within my budget and ensures I get the product I need without risking further delays."
