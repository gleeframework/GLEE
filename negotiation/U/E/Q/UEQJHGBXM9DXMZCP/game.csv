"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,250. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from this product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,100. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",8100.0,Alice,5,
