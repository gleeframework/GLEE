"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
