Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My minimum:** I won't sell for less than $1,000,000 (John's offer). 
* **Negotiation:** I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's value as possible, but still leaving room for him to feel he's getting a good deal. 

By offering $1,400,000, I'm:

* **Maximizing profit:** I'm getting $400,000 more than John's offer.
* **Giving Bob a good deal:** He saves $100,000 compared to his perceived value.

This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the need to incentivize Bob to accept the offer."
