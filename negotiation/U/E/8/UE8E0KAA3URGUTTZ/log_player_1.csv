"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 120} 
 
I'm starting with my minimum price, hoping to get the most out of the deal. Since John is willing to pay $120, I'm not willing to go any lower at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what John is offering. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering a price of $110. This is still higher than his offer but lower than my initial price.  I hope this will entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is within my acceptable range, and it's a much better deal than selling to John for $120.  This is a good outcome considering the limited rounds of negotiation."
