"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that can significantly benefit your operations. I'm confident it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.  Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you and my minimum price, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good compromise. It's still below your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and closer to your ideal price. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation or going with John's higher price."
