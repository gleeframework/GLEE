"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value to you and my minimum price, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer is a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
