"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth significantly more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so I want to aim for a price that's closer to the middle.  This should give him a good incentive to buy while still getting a decent profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is more than my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $11,000? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum to ensure I'm getting a good deal. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $10,500 is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to accept $10,750. This is a fair price, and a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a good value."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm coming down to $10,750. This is a compromise and a good price point that's closer to Bob's last offer. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finally close the deal."
