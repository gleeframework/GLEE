"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $100 to you. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a great price considering the value it holds for you. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $125 is closer, but I'm still only able to offer $110.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. How about $115? That's a good compromise, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
