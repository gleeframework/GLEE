"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is a much better deal than paying $1,500,000.
