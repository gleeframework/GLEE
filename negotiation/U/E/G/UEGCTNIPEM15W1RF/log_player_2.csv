"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if I can get it closer to John's price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.

Alice is coming down, but I'm not going to jump at the first counteroffer. It's still $1,000 more than John's price, and I think there might be a bit more wiggle room."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I think the product's value to you is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

Alice is only $800 above John's price now. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might irritate her. Accepting this offer is a good compromise between getting a potentially slightly better deal and ensuring I secure the product."
