"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I think the product's value to you is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,
