Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,600,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $1,575,000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $1,575,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and continuing the negotiation risks losing him as a buyer altogether."
