"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to $120.  What about $125?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I really think this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. However, I'm willing to throw in some extra perks to sweeten the deal. How about I include a free accessory that normally costs $20, and I'll sell the product to you for $135? It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the package.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer of the accessory, but my budget is tight.  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement on the price of the product itself.  How about we meet at $132?  It's a small compromise, but I think it's a good deal for both of us.",132.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $135. How about I throw in another small perk, a discount code for 10% off your next purchase, and sell the product to you for $134? It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the package.",134.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to go up to $133, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can agree on that, I'll take the product and the discount code.  Let's close this deal!",133.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on getting the maximum value for my product. I'm willing to throw in one more perk: a personalized thank-you note from me, which is worth $5. If you're willing to meet me at $133.50, I'll accept your offer and close the deal.",133.5,Alice,9,
