Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for some room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $16,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above my budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if we can find a price closer to my limit.  Rejecting the offer allows for further counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $14,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. I'm thinking of a price of $15,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground here. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $15,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $14,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me and gives you a good profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.  I'm open to continuing the discussion, but if we can't find a middle ground, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of a price of $15,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is already a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. If we can't agree on this price, I may need to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, we've been going back and forth for a few rounds now.  At this point, it's getting close to my limit, and I'm not sure how much lower Alice is willing to go.  Since I can get the product from John for $10,000, it's the safer option to go with John. This ensures I get the product at my desired price."
