``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still holding firm on getting a price closer to my initial offer."

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I still feel I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge further."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum and we only have a few rounds left.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely."
