Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  A friendly tone helps to build rapport and increases the chances of Bob accepting or making a counteroffer. 
* **Focus on value:** Mentioning Bob's perceived value subtly encourages him to see the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  If Bob rejects, I still have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I can get at least my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is the highest I can go, as I have another seller offering it for $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's higher than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price. 
* **John's offer provides security:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation and allows me to risk rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint offer:** Meeting halfway creates a perception of fairness.  
* **Positive framing:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" for both sides can make the offer more appealing. 
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
