"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is the highest I can go, as I have another seller offering it for $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000, it's more financially beneficial to simply buy from John.  Further negotiation with Alice has the potential to lower the price, but it also carries the risk of Alice rejecting any future counteroffers, leaving Bob with no product."
