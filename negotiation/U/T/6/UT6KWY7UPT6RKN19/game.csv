"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is the highest I can go, as I have another seller offering it for $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $12,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
