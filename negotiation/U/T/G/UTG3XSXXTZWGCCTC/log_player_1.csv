Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""value and potential""  might pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in your offer can make it seem more appealing. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might outright reject the price, but it gives you a starting point to potentially reach a deal above your minimum."
