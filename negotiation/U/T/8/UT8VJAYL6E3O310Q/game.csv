"Bob, I understand your position.  While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm looking for a bit more to make this deal worthwhile.  How about $12,500? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,750 is a good offer, but I'm still a little short of my target. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with this deal. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,5,
