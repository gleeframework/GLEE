Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm suggesting a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest possible price is ideal, but we need a strategy to avoid Bob rejecting the offer and us settling for John's $1,000,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you (much better than John's offer) while still offering Bob a good deal. He gains $50,000 in value by buying from you at this price ($1,200,000 - $1,150,000 = $50,000).
* **First Refusal:** Offering it to Bob first at this attractive price increases the likelihood of him accepting, as he knows he's getting a better deal than going elsewhere."
