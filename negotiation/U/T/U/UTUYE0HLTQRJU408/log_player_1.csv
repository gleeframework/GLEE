Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,300,000,  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you can start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above his perceived value but below your guaranteed price.
* **Justification of value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly suggesting the price is justified.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk that Bob might reject the offer."
