Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's generally a good tactic in negotiation to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** By starting at $120,  you give Bob space to haggle and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle, closer to your desired price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay. His response will inform your next move. 
 
Remember: You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $80 if the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum price ($80) and his own stated value for the product ($80). This suggests:

* **Bob might be lowballing:** He's likely trying to negotiate a much lower price than he's actually willing to pay. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's a large gap between your offer and his counteroffer, indicating space for further discussion.

By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and are willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  While I can't go as low as $60, how about we meet in the middle at $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** By coming down from your initial offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Stay above your minimum:** The $100 counteroffer is still comfortably above your $80 minimum and allows room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Target a price closer to Bob's value:** Since Bob values the product at $80, proposing a price closer to his valuation increases the chances of him accepting.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** While you're compromising, the tone remains confident and emphasizes your desire for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $80? I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for that price, so I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches both your minimum acceptable price ($80) and his own stated value for the product.  

* **No further gains likely:** Trying to negotiate further could risk losing the sale altogether, especially since Bob mentioned he has an alternative seller. 
* **Securing your target price:**  You've successfully negotiated Bob up to your desired price, achieving your goal in the negotiation."
