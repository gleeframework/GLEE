I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always come down a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a bit more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

I'm counteroffering at $9,800. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that shows I'm willing to compromise, but also demonstrates the product's value."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is my final offer, matching Bob's previous offer.  I'm hoping we can close the deal here. If he rejects, I'll sell to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell to John for $8,000.  Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk going any lower.  It's better to secure the deal with John and get a guaranteed profit."
