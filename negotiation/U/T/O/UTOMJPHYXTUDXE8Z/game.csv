"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,350,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $1,100,000. This offer considers both the product's value and my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential benefits it offers you, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
