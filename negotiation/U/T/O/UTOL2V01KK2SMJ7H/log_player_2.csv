"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It's highly likely you can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer  tests Alice's willingness to negotiate. This offer is still  within a reasonable range where Alice makes a profit, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposal. I could consider letting it go for $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice came down slightly in her counteroffer, but it's still far above your ideal price and what John is offering. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if she'll move closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I agree the product has potential,  $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:**  Moving significantly closer to Alice's price indicates you're serious about finding a deal.
* **Stays below your maximum:** It keeps you within a reasonable range of your budget and John's offer.
* **Offers a psychological edge:** The ""meeting in the middle"" approach can be persuasive, even though the middle ground is still more favorable to Alice."
