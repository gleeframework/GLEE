"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than the product's worth to Alice ($150), it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum price point of $120.  He's better off continuing to negotiate with Alice in hopes of reaching a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $135 is still a bit more than I can do right now. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
