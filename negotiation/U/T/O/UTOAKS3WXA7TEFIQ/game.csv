"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. How about $135?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $135 is still a bit more than I can do right now. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
