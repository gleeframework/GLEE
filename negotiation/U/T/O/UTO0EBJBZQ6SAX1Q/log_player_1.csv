Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to own [product description] for a price of $1,200,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire a truly unique asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase such a unique product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $950000 for this item. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired value by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Would you be interested in a price of $1,100,000?  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1050000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is within a reasonable range and higher than John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a good profit."
