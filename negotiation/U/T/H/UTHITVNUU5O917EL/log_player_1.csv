Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get the highest price possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.

By offering the product at $119, I am aiming for a price that's just below John's offer while still significantly above Bob's perceived value.  This gives Bob a ""deal"" feeling and increases the chances of him accepting, maximizing my potential profit."
