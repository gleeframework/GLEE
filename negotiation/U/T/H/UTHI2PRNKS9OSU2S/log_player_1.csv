Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this price reflects its true value, and it's a significant opportunity for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is a significant amount for Bob but still leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering $950,000, I leave room for Bob to make a counteroffer without me feeling like I need to immediately drop my price too drastically.
* **Understanding John's Offer:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer and still leaves me with a good amount of profit. However, I believe I can do better.
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I still have a significant bargaining advantage because Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I can likely push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **John's Offer:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a safe option, I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob, aiming to close the gap but still ensuring I get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value you place on this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll accept $900,000. This is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering $900,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Appeal to Value:** I remind Bob of the value he places on the product, subtly implying that he's getting a good deal even at $900,000.
* **Finality:** I've stated this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away. This keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to weigh the risk of continuing to negotiate with him against accepting John's offer of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel there might be room for a better deal. I am willing to pay $875,000 for your product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Floor:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. However, I still believe there's room for improvement.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and he's already shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's a good chance I can get closer to my target price.
* **John's Offer:** While $800,000 is a guaranteed profit, I'm not yet ready to settle for that.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price between $875,000 and my previous offer of $900,000. This will keep the negotiation going while maintaining a profitable outcome for me."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. To show my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Small Compromise:** I'm only dropping to $890,000, a small compromise from my previous offer of $900,000. This shows I'm still confident in the product's value.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer of $800,000. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my final offer."
