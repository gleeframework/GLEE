"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering its value. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $8,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're getting close. How about $8,000 even? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product without breaking the bank.",8000.0,Bob,6,
