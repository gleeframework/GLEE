"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $1,200,000.
* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's offer of $1,200,000.
* However, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and negotiating with her or potentially finding another seller.  There's no need to rush into a deal."
