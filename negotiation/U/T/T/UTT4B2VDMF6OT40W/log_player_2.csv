"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's exceptional features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's best to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is far higher than my budget.  Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for this product.  This is a fair starting point for us to work with."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking that $800000 might be a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1200000? This is a compromise that I think is more in line with the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to your budget, it's still more than you're comfortable with.  You should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I'm only comfortable going up to $950,000.  This would allow both of us to reach an agreement that's fair and reasonable."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $950000 is enough to reflect the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1100000? This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your budget.  There is still room to negotiate.  You should make a counteroffer closer to your budget, but don't go too low that Alice walks away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Considering our previous discussions and the value I'm looking for, I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1150000? This is my last offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still higher than your maximum budget. You've already gone through 6 rounds of negotiations, and it's getting risky to keep pushing for a lower price.  Since John is willing to sell you the product for $1,000,000, it's better to secure the product now and avoid potentially losing the deal with Alice."
