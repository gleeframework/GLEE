Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already made concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,075,000. I'm willing to sweeten the deal by throwing in some additional support and maintenance services, which would normally cost $25,000. This way, you'll get even more value out of the product. I'm sticking with my price of $1,075,000, but I'm adding the extra services. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge significantly from her $1,075,000 price. While the additional services are a nice gesture, they don't justify exceeding your $1,000,000 target.  Buying from John for $1,200,000 is less ideal, but ensures you get the product and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation."
