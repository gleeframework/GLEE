"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. It's better to reject the initial offer and see if you can get Alice closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $90 and my target price of $80. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. It's a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer, as Alice would still be making a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is only $7 above my desired price of $80.  Given that I have limited rounds and John is offering a price that's closer to my maximum, accepting this offer is the best choice.  It ensures I get the product within my budget while minimizing risk."
