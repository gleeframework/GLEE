Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than your minimum price. This strategy aims to:

* **Get a good deal:** It's likely Bob will consider the offer, as it's closer to his perceived value than your minimum.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your counteroffers based on his response. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed sale with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate higher.  By rejecting, you can:

* **Increase your potential earnings:** You can potentially get closer to your desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting immediately, you show Bob that you're not desperate for a sale. 
* **Keep John as an option:**  You can still sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer. It:

* **Shows flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Keeps the deal alive:** It's a reasonable price for Bob to consider, increasing the chances of a successful agreement.
* **Doesn't compromise your minimum:**  It's still above your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John, ensuring you get your minimum price.  This approach:

* **Guarantees your minimum:** You avoid the risk of further negotiations failing.
* **Maximizes your potential profit:** $12,000 is the highest possible price you can get at this point.
* **Ends the negotiation:**  It allows you to move on to other opportunities."
