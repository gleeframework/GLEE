{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly and optimistic tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a starting point for negotiation, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **John as a safety net:** I'm aware of John's offer of $1,200,000, so I have a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **John's offer is still available:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is too low, I can still try to negotiate a better price in the next round. 

**Next Steps:** 

I will reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, potentially $1,050,000. I'll explain that while I appreciate his interest, his offer is too low considering the product's value and my other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident its value is higher than that.  To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while still allowing for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My counteroffer is firm but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows Bob that I'm willing to be reasonable but won't undervalue my product.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the product's value and why my price is justified.
* **Show Flexibility:** I've lowered my price from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I frame the offer as a way to reach a ""good deal for both of us,"" emphasizing a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I don't need to take a risk on a lower price.
* **Room for compromise:**  While I'm not willing to accept $950,000, I'm open to further negotiation to see if we can find a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and propose a new counteroffer of $1,000,000. I will explain that I appreciate his increased offer but $1,000,000 is a more realistic price based on the product's value and my other options."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low. Considering the product's value and my other options, I'm confident $1,000,000 is a fair price.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm now willing to accept $1,000,000, which is significantly closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000.  This is a compromise that allows me to earn a significant amount while potentially closing a deal with Bob. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Mutual Benefit Focus:**  I reiterate that this price is ""good for both of us,"" emphasizing a win-win situation to encourage Bob to agree.
* **Clear Signal:** I've lowered my price twice, indicating I'm open to negotiation but am reaching the limit of my flexibility.

**Outcome:** 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will confidently sell the product to John for $1,200,000, as I'm confident that $1,000,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my willingness to negotiate."
