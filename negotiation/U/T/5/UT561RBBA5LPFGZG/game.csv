"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident its value is higher than that.  To show you I'm willing to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while still allowing for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with your offer, but $950000 is still a bit too low. Considering the product's value and my other options, I'm confident $1000000 is a fair price. It's a number that reflects the product's worth while allowing for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
