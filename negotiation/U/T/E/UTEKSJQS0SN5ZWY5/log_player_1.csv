Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, aiming higher with Bob is strategically sound. 
* **Perceived Value:** The wording emphasizes the product's ""immense value"" and ""unique opportunity"" to nudge Bob towards accepting a higher price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The initial offer leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that we value the product highly but are open to discussion.

This strategy balances ambition with a safety net. If Bob declines, we still have John as a guaranteed buyer at our minimum acceptable price."
