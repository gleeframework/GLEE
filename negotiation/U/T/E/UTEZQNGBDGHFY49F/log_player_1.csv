Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $120 to John, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $140 represents a reasonable markup that Bob might be willing to pay to secure the item immediately, avoiding the risk of missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a slightly higher price leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that he might find acceptable."
