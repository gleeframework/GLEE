It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $12,000."

You're still closer to your goal price of $10,000 than Alice is to her goal of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

While you'd prefer to pay less, Alice has been firm on $11,500.  It's likely you won't get a lower price from her, and buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
