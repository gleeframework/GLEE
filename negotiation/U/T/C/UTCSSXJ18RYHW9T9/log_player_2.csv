It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Alice has started repeating her price points and adding ""extras"" instead of moving closer to your budget. This suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Time Limit:** You're down to the last round. If you reject Alice's offer now, you risk running out of time and being stuck with no deal.
* **John's Price is Fixed:** John offers certainty. While it's higher than you'd like, it guarantees you get the product and avoids the risk of Alice completely walking away. 

While buying from John means spending a bit more, it's the safer option at this stage to ensure you acquire the product."
