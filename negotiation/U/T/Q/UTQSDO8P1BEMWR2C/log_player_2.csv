"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a little high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counteroffer ($60) allows for room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $80 maximum and John's offer. It's important to appear interested but price-conscious to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above what John is offering. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm splitting the difference between her offer ($90) and my previous counteroffer ($60). This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $100. It's clear she's aiming for a price well above my budget. Accepting defeat and buying from John for $80 ensures I get the product at the best possible price."
