I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum price. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while ensuring a guaranteed sale."
