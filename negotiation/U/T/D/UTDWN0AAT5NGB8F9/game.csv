"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a little high for me.  I'm really hoping we can settle on $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for the product.",125.0,Bob,4,
