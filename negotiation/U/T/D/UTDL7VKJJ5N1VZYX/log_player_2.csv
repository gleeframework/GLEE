It's not worth buying from Alice for $175 when you can get it from John for $100.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

You're willing to pay the maximum you're comfortable with, hoping Alice will see the value in making a deal rather than risking losing the sale entirely."

Alice's offer is now within your budget and is significantly better than buying from John. It's a good deal for you."
