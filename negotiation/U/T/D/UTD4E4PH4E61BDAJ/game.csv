"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $7000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8500?  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $7500?,7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7500 just doesn't cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle at $8000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with this product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
