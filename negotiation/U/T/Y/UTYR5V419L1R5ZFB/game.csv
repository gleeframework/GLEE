"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $107.50. Can you consider this offer?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.50?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think we can reach a deal.",108.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $108.50. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",108.0,Bob,6,
