"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a price below its value. However, I believe we can reach an even better agreement. I am willing to pay $820,000 for the product. This price reflects my valuation while still allowing for a reasonable profit for you. I look forward to your response.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $820,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $880,000.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still leave some room for profit. Let's find a middle ground.",880000.0,Alice,3,
