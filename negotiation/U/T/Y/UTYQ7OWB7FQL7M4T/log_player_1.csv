"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $13000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by negotiating further.  I'll see if I can get him closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13500}
