"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's aiming to get the product for $10,000 or less, and Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his target, he's still aiming for $10,000 or less.  It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,800 is still a bit too high. I'm really only able to go up to $10,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and allows us both to come to an agreement. Let's see if we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,200 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,500.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's target, he has only 5 rounds left.  There's no guarantee he can get Alice to come down to his ideal price, and he's already had a few rounds where Alice rejected his offers.  

It's safer for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000.  He achieves his goal and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
