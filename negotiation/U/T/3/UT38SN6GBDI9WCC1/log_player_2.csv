"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but her starting offer of $12,000 leaves little room for negotiation. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  While John's price is high, it's a good fallback option if you can't get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. How about we start at $10,000?  I think this is a fair starting point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has come down from $12,000, you are still looking to save more money.
* **You have several rounds left.** Continuing the negotiation gives you more time to potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  While John's price is high, it's a good backup if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target.**  $11,250 is only $250 away from your counteroffer of $11,000.
* **You have a lot of rounds left.** Even if you reject this offer, you still have several rounds to negotiate further.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** While his price is higher, it's a good fallback if you can't reach a deal with Alice.

**Since Alice is willing to meet you almost halfway, it's likely that accepting this offer is the best choice. You save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and you still have more rounds to potentially negotiate a lower price if necessary.**"
