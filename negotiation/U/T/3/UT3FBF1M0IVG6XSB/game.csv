"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $7500? Let me know your thoughts.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7500 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $8250? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $8000. This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product from John for that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
