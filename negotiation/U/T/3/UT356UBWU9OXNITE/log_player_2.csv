"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John offers. You can save a substantial amount of money ($400,000) by going with John."
