Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing"" the price. This signals to Bob that there's flexibility and encourages him to engage in the negotiation process.
* **Highlighting Value:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's worth to encourage him to consider a higher price. 

**Why this strategy is better than simply offering $15,000:**

* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $19,000 price, exceeding your minimum. 
* **Stronger Negotiating Position:** Even if Bob counter-offers, you're starting from a stronger position. A counter-offer will likely be closer to your desired price than if you started at $15,000.

**Important Note:** It's crucial to remain flexible and gauge Bob's reactions during the negotiation. If he seems completely turned off by the $19,000, be prepared to adjust your offer strategically. However, always remember your bottom line ($15,000) and be willing to walk away if necessary, knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John."
