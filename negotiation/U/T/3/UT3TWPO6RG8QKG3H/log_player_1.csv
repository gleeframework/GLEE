Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,199,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this premium price point."", 
""product_price"": 1199999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **High but Negotiable:** Starting with $1,199,999 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room for negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a price higher than your guaranteed sale. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by highlighting  ""significant value"" and a ""premium price point."" This framing might make Bob feel he's getting something exclusive. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable potentially losing the sale to Bob if he's unwilling to pay above your guaranteed price.  It prioritizes maximizing potential profit."
