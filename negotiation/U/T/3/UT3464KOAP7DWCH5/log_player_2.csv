"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has no information about the value of the product to Alice. It's possible she's willing to sell for significantly less.  There's no downside to rejecting and seeing if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is taking a significant gamble by offering a price that's 33% lower than Alice's initial offer. This assumes Alice is more motivated to sell than she initially indicated. It's a bold move to start the negotiation with a strong counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has lowered her price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It's still too high for Bob's target, so he'll continue to counter-offer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below $13,500. This strategy allows for a more gradual negotiation and avoids risking an immediate deal at a higher price."
