"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. Would you like to make an offer on the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a game-changing asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to Bob's budget:**  $875,000 is only $75,000 more than Bob's maximum budget.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** If Bob rejects the offer, it's likely Alice will counter with a price closer to her desired $900,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  The negotiation has already gone two rounds, and Bob wants to avoid going through many more rounds if possible.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal or ending up paying more is high. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price within his budget."
