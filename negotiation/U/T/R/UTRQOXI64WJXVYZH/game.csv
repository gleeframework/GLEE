,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
