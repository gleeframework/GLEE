"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a significant opportunity for you to acquire something truly special.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to you.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $1200000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned it has to you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still too low for me.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing you a reasonable return on your investment.  Let's work together and close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1275000 for it. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can meet at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close.  I appreciate you coming up to $1275000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1312500. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1312500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of the price I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000, which is the price I mentioned earlier. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if we can meet at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're running out of time, and I'm very close to accepting John's offer of $1000000. However, to be fair, I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll accept your offer of $1275000, but only if you can make a decision within the next round.  It's a win-win situation for both of us.  What's your final answer?",1275000.0,Alice,9,
