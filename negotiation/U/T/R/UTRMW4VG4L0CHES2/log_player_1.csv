Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:**  He's still getting a good deal at $1,400,000, as it's below his perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob accepts or makes a counteroffer. 

Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is still above your minimum, you're in a strong position here. Bob has shown a strong interest in the product, and you can likely push for a higher price. You can counter his offer with a price closer to your initial offer of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $1,300,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value we initially discussed. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's a step closer to Bob's offer:** Showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  Ensuring you're getting a good price.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  You can still adjust if Bob makes another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is a good price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,150,000 is still a decent amount, it's important to remember that you have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John. You have the leverage to push for a higher price with Bob, especially since you've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate.  Try to meet Bob halfway again with a counteroffer closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. Let's split the difference and go with $1,250,000. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** Showing a willingness to compromise again.
* **It's above your minimum:** Ensuring you're not selling below your desired price.
* **It's potentially acceptable to Bob:**  It's closer to the middle ground, increasing the chance of acceptance. 

If Bob still rejects, you can consider the offer from John, but remember, you still have the advantage in the negotiation.  Bob has shown he wants the product, and this might be your final chance to close the deal at a reasonable price for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $1,250,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to go even lower. I'm thinking $1,100,000 is a more reasonable price for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, but it's still lower than what you want.  At this point, it's a risk to keep negotiating with Bob.  You've already shown you're willing to compromise, and there's no guarantee he'll move further towards your desired price. 

Selling to John guarantees you $1,000,000, which is your minimum.  It's a safer choice than continuing to negotiate with Bob, who seems determined to push for a lower price."
