"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique item that holds significant value to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Consider this your chance to secure it before it goes to another buyer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is your maximum budget, there's no advantage to accepting her offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price. You're not saving any money by buying from Alice."
