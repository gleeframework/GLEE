"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $110? This would still give you a great deal, and it would be closer to my desired price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a fair compromise.  This allows you to get the product at a good price and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",120.0,Alice,5,
