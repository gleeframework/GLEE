{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value of the product ($80) but below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one last time to push for a higher price."
