"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100). This gives me some room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm friendly and positive, highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, but I want to leave room for negotiation in case Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm also trying to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his response and how many rounds remain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I want to see if I can get closer to that number.  I also want to see how determined Bob is to get the product.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round. I'll likely start with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above $90. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise further, or if he'll walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm remaining friendly and positive, reiterating the value of the product to Bob.  

**Strategy:**

By offering a price halfway between, I'm trying to signal that I'm serious about making a deal but also not willing to accept a price that's too low. I'm hoping to get Bob to budge a little closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a deal, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling for that amount. I'm committed to getting as close to $100 as possible.  

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target. I'll keep in mind that we're down to the last few rounds, and I need to make sure I don't miss out on a potentially good deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about we settle on $94?  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a compromise price of $94.  This is still closer to my ideal price point of $100, but it also reflects a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Message:**  I'm remaining positive and friendly, highlighting the benefits of a deal for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

With fewer rounds remaining, I'm trying to nudge Bob closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping he'll see the value in this product and realize that $94 is a reasonable price, especially since he already raised his offer to $92.  I'm also mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $94 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $91. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm still not comfortable selling for $91, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. However, with only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $94. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $100, and I need to weigh the potential of a better deal with Bob against the risk of losing him completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $91 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference one more time. How about $92.50? It's a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering a compromise price of $92.50. This is slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but it also shows that I'm willing to move towards his price point.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing that this offer is a fair price for both of us, and I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning the need to finalize the deal. 

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's also close enough to Bob's price that it could be tempting for him. I'm hoping to reach a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. We're down to the last two rounds, and I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to go higher.  

**Strategy:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close a deal with Bob at a higher price, selling to John for $100 ensures that I'll at least meet my minimum profit goal."
