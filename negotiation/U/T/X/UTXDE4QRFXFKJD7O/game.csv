"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference and go with $86.  I'm confident you'll still make a good profit at that price.",86.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more move. I can offer you the product for $88. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",88.0,Alice,5,
