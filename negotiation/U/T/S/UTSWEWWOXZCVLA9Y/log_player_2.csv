(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have 10 rounds and can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still above what I want to pay.  I have several rounds left, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still staying below Alice's latest offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to drastically overpay.  This should keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, but it's still too high.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price.  I'm only five rounds into the negotiation, so there's plenty of time to find a middle ground.  I'm not yet ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still staying below Alice's latest offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground. I'm also aware that we're in the middle of the negotiation, so I'm trying to be more aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price but it's still above it. We have only 3 rounds left and it's highly unlikely that Alice will agree to a price under $950,000 in that timeframe.  I've been negotiating with Alice for a while and I'm not confident that I can secure a better price.  It's time to move on and purchase from John."
