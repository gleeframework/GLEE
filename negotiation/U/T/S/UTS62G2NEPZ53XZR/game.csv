"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price.  Would you be willing to consider $13,000?  It's a compromise, and I believe it still provides you with great value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is my final offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",13500.0,Alice,5,
