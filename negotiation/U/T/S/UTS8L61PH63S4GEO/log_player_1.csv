Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a good profit for myself. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  I'm aware that the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so there's incentive for him to negotiate. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John's offer of $1,000,000  in mind gives me a safety net. If negotiations with Bob stall, I can always accept John's offer.

I'm eager to see Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still not fully satisfied. I'm confident I can get more.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control and potentially push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to risk a little more to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob. 

I'll now counteroffer Bob and see if I can strike a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $1,125,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving a good profit for me.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer is exactly in the middle between my previous offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm not conceding too much, keeping the pressure on Bob to potentially raise his offer again. 

I'm hopeful this counteroffer will be appealing enough to Bob to finalize the deal, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has stuck to his offer of $1,100,000, and I've already countered twice. Further negotiations are unlikely to result in a significantly higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on, potentially leading to a situation where Bob decides to walk away or I lose interest in the deal.
* **Secure Profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit of $100,000, which is still a good outcome.

While I would prefer to earn more, accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a quick and profitable transaction."
