"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my unique product, which I know you've been interested in.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of acquiring it. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's opening offer is already quite high, leaving little room for negotiation and potential savings. 
* By rejecting this offer, we signal that the price is too high. This may prompt Alice to counter with a lower price, closer to her product's value of $800,000. 
* Even if Alice doesn't significantly lower her price, we can always fall back on buying from John at $1,200,000.  

Let's see if we can get a better deal before resorting to John!"
