"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,
