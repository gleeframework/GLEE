"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you a fair price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially negotiate a lower price. There's also the option of buying from John for a lower price if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that he'll get a lower price, especially since Alice has already met him halfway.  Accepting the offer secures the product for a price that's still within Bob's desired range."
