"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you a fair price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
