I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I cannot accept it as it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm countering with $1,800,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still remaining above my minimum threshold. I hope this price will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to close the gap a bit more with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm countering with $1,600,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving some room for negotiation. If he rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. However, considering the back and forth and the potential for further negotiation, I'm going to take the guaranteed offer from John. It's not ideal to get my absolute minimum, but it avoids further negotiation and ensures a sale."
