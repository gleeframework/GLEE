"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

Bob can likely get a better price than $13,000, given the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you taking the time to consider it. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significant, and $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $11,500, Bob is still getting a good deal.  It's less than half of what he would pay John, and Alice is getting a decent price above her own valuation."
