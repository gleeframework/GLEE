You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. $900,000 is still too high, and you have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
``` 

This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating your desire to negotiate. It also leaves room for potential compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$850,000 is still higher than your desired price, and you have room to negotiate further. Continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

This counteroffer shows you are willing to compromise while still staying within your budget. You are moving closer to Alice's price point, but still offering a price lower than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to push for a lower price, it's likely Alice won't budge much further. At this point, $825,000 is a good compromise that keeps you within your budget and allows you to secure the product. There's a risk that Alice might reject your next counteroffer, and you could end up buying from John for a much higher price."
