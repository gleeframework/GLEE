"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This reflects the product's value while still giving you a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer $8,750.  Let's split the difference and close this deal. ",8750.0,Bob,4,
