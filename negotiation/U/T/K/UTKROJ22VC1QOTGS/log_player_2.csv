"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a better price. It's unlikely Alice will accept a counteroffer of $8,000 in the first round, but it's worth trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15,000 is quite a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in working with me on this."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  It's important to start with a significantly lower counteroffer to signal your serious intent to negotiate.  $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise.
* **Positive but firm:** The message is polite but assertive, expressing willingness to buy while emphasizing your budget constraint.
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Alice to counter without making it seem like she's immediately accepting a huge loss."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still too high.  While it's closer to my target, it's still outside my ideal price range. It's important to keep negotiating to try and get a lower price.  The risk of buying from John is still present, but I can continue to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $13,000 is still a bit too high for me though. How about we split the difference at $11,000? I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** The goal is to close the gap between Alice's price and my budget.  A counteroffer of $11,000 keeps the pressure on Alice and demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Compromise:** Splitting the difference shows a willingness to meet halfway, making it more likely Alice will see the value in moving forward with the deal.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message remains positive, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
