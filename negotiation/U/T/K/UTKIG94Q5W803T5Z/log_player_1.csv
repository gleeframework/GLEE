Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($40) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
