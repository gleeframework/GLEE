"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $11,750?",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $11,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
