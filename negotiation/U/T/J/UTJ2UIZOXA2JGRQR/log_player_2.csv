"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows him to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the price down as much as possible. He knows Alice's minimum is likely around $100, so offering $105 is a reasonable starting point for his counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice he's serious about a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  He's willing to pay up to $120 from John, but he's hoping to get a better deal from Alice. By rejecting her offer, he can continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice he is willing to compromise, but also demonstrates that he still believes the price is too high. This offer keeps the negotiation moving and potentially could get Alice closer to accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he wants to pay.  He has a few rounds left, and he's determined to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price that's more favorable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's likely minimum price.  By offering $112, he is showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal than Alice's last offer. This offer keeps the negotiation moving and might convince Alice to accept, especially since there are only a few rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the best price possible. Although Alice's offer is getting closer to his maximum, he believes he can get a better deal by rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations.  He only has three rounds left, but he's willing to risk it to try and save a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a significant increase to his offer, but he's still trying to stay under Alice's current offer. He only has two rounds left and wants to make a final push to get Alice to accept a price closer to his maximum. He believes offering $115 will demonstrate a commitment to closing the deal and potentially persuade Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is now equal to what Bob can buy the product for from John. It's unlikely that Alice will offer a lower price in the final round. This means Bob has no incentive to continue negotiating, and he'll end up paying the same price either way.  It's more efficient to simply buy from John and avoid further negotiations."
