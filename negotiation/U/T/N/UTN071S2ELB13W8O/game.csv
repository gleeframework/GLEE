"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
