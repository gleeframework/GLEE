Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product ($8,000) but significantly lower than my own minimum value ($15,000).  This gives Bob an incentive to buy while still ensuring I make a profit. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for a higher price."
