Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation. If Bob immediately accepts, I get the best possible outcome. If he negotiates down, I'm still likely to end up with a price higher than John's $100 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, I started the negotiation with a higher price for a reason. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price from Bob than $100. I'll aim for a counteroffer somewhere between $100 and my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his initial offer and John's standing offer. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties and increases the likelihood of agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's interested. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, $110 is a solid gain over John's $100 offer. It's a good point to accept and close the deal."
