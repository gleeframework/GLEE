"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and what I've researched about the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $900,000 falls short of what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $950,000? I think that's a more reasonable price for a product of this value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be firm on this. The product's value is undeniable. Let's make this work â€“ I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $950,000, which was my previous offer. How about $975,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
