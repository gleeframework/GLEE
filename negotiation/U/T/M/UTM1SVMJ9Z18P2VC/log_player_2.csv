# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it's only fair to extend this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $14,500. This is a special offer tailored specifically for you, considering its immense value to you. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,750 for the product. This price still reflects its value while providing some flexibility for you. Please let me know if this is something you would consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
