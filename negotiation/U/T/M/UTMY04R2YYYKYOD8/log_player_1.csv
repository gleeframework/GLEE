Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $950,000 is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, showing I'm open to negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and invites a response, encouraging Bob to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and inviting Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, having John as a potential buyer at $1,000,000 provides a strong safety net. 

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I acknowledge the product's value to you, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $900,000. This takes into account the product's worth to you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  My counter-offer of $900,000 is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It signals my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'll receive.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message remains friendly and encourages Bob to finalize the deal.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, keeping the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000 again. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  We've reached a stalemate, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result for me.
* **John's Offer:** John is ready to pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me the best possible outcome.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  By selling to John, I eliminate the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or a prolonged negotiation process.

While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob,  selling to John ensures I secure my desired profit and avoid further potential losses."
