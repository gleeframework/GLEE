"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120, as I mentioned earlier. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $160? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $160 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $140, as I mentioned earlier. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $140 is getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low. I'm willing to go down to $150, which is still a fair price for this fantastic product. Let's close the deal at this price, and you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but I still think $150 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $145, as I mentioned earlier. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $145 is tempting, it's only $5 more than my minimum acceptable price, and there's a risk that Bob will continue to haggle.  I don't want to risk further rounds and I can get my minimum price immediately by selling to John."
