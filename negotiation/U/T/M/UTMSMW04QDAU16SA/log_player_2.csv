```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,500:**  This is lower than Bob's initial price point of $15,000 and a better deal than the $14,000 Alice initially offered.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might walk away or increase her price. 
* **Accepting saves money:** Accepting the offer secures the product for Bob at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, achieving his goal of saving money."
