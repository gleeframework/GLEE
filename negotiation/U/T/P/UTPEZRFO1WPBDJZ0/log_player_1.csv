"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value to leave room for negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable considering the product's value to me and the possibility of selling it to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better. Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value, so I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product for $150, which is my minimum acceptable value. This should hopefully be a good compromise, allowing both of us to get a decent deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $140, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This is still above my minimum acceptable value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable value.  There are limited rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
