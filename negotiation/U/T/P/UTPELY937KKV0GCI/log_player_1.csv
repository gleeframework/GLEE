Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While I understand your budget constraints, the  $700,000 offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still far outside what I can justify. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. I can offer $900,000 as a sign of good faith. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

We're still significantly below John's offer. Let's see if we can nudge Bob closer to a more reasonable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but the value this product brings is still significantly higher.  To meet you closer to your range, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price. I'm still very interested in what you're offering, but I'm only willing to go as high as $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a tough decision point. Bob's offer is getting closer to a palatable range, but it's still a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  There's also a risk Bob walks if we push further.

```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

While we could try to negotiate Bob up further, it's getting risky. He's shown his hand with a ""final offer"" and likely has a hard limit. Accepting a lower offer now eliminates the chance of getting closer to John's price.  It's wiser to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John and avoid potentially leaving money on the table."
