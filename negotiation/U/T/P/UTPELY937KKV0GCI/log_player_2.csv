"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly. Buying from John right now would be settling for your absolute maximum budget without even trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  I'm willing to offer $700,000."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $700,000 is significantly lower than Alice's opening offer, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer leaves space to increase the bid gradually while staying well below the $800,000 maximum.
* **Gauging Alice's Reaction:**  This aggressive counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While I understand your budget constraints, the  $700,000 offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise and keeps us both moving towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved down from her initial offer, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than both your budget and your opening counteroffer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to adjust her price, even if only slightly, suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping the John option open is a good negotiation tactic, reminding yourself there's an alternative if the price doesn't come down enough."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,900,000 is still far outside what I can justify. I'm serious about purchasing this product, but it needs to be at a price that makes sense for both of us. I can offer $900,000 as a sign of good faith. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** This counteroffer makes a significant jump from your previous offer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and move closer to Alice's asking price. 
* **Still Below Budget:** The offer remains below your maximum budget, leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will test whether Alice is truly willing to negotiate within a more reasonable range or if she's firmly set on a much higher price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but the value this product brings is still significantly higher.  To meet you closer to your range, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair offer that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:**  While Alice is moving in the right direction, her concessions are slow. At this rate, reaching a price you're comfortable with might take too long.
* **Alternative Pressure:**  You have a good alternative with John's offer.  It's time to start applying pressure by making Alice aware that you have other options.
* **Further Negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive while signaling that you need a more substantial price drop."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for a similar product at a significantly lower price. I'm still very interested in what you're offering, but I'm only willing to go as high as $1,100,000.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if it works for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you create a sense of urgency and signal that you're serious about walking away if necessary.
* **Strong Increase, Below Budget:** This counteroffer represents a significant increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. However, it remains comfortably below your maximum budget.
* **Applying Pressure:**  Mentioning the alternative offer without revealing the specific price puts pressure on Alice to make a more competitive offer. It shows her you have other options and are not afraid to walk away from the deal."
