"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, and you have a backup option of buying from John for $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $850,000, which is halfway between my maximum budget of $800,000 and Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further.  I'm willing to pay more than $800,000 (John's price) because I may be able to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 880000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $880,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still trying to stay below my maximum budget of $800,000.  I believe this offer is reasonable, given that Alice has already lowered her price from $950,000 to $920,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down to $910,000, I'm still not willing to go over my maximum budget of $800,000. I will reject her offer and continue negotiating with Alice, as I'm hoping to reach a deal closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $890,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice I'm willing to meet her halfway.  I believe this offer is fair considering her latest offer of $910,000. It's also getting closer to my budget, but still leaves room for potential further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $900,000, which is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  I've made several counteroffers, but it seems Alice isn't willing to go lower.  Rather than continuing to negotiate and potentially risk losing the product entirely, it's best to accept the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000."
