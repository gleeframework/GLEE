Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and to be fair, I wouldn't accept anything less than $1,000,000 from anyone else. However, to give you a chance to secure it first, I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to be slightly aggressive with Bob.
* **Value Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying a price above $1,000,000.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept before considering negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential reward of an extra $200,000 makes it a calculated gamble worth taking."
