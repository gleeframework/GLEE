"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  While $1,200,000 is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing product at a discounted price.

While $1,100,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your desired price point.  You can likely still negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option at this point."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,050,000, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value of the product to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

Alice has come down significantly, and while it's not your ideal price, $1,080,000 is a good deal for you considering the product's value to you and the potential cost of buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the best strategy at this point."
