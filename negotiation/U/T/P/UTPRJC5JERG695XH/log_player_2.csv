I'm starting with a lower price point, as I'm only willing to pay up to $8,000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a strong starting point."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my maximum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm starting to get a bit anxious about running out of rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm still sticking to my limit. With only a few rounds left, I need to make a move that shows I'm serious about buying but also keeps me within my budget."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still a bit above my maximum. With only a few rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate. It's better to be safe than sorry, so I'll go with John's offer and ensure I get the product within my budget."
