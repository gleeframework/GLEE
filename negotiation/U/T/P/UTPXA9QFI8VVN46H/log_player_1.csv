"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and get an idea of his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see what his counteroffer is. This will give me a better idea of his actual budget and willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer and closer to my desired price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
