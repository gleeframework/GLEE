"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about $1,050,000 for the product?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $1,080,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a very fair price, considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's try to make this happen.",1080000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've done some research and found that there are other sellers willing to match my budget. However, I still think we can work something out. How about $1,060,000 for the product?",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,060,000 is still not close to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,070,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you while allowing me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",1070000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really value the product, but I'm not comfortable going above $1,065,000. Can we meet in the middle? How about $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
