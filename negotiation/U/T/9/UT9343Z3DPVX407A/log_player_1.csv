Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about $1,050,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product's true worth.  I want to see if we can close the gap further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need at least $1,080,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a very fair price, considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1080000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,060,000 is still not close to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,070,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for you while allowing me to get closer to my goal.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1070000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm selling to John. Bob's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of rounds and I'm not confident I can get a better price from him. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
