"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price given its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while leaving room for you to benefit greatly.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your initial offer and is closer to my valuation. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the inherent value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $985,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",985000.0,Bob,6,
