"I'm starting to feel like we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $14500, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. I'll sell the product to John for $10000, and I think you'll regret not taking it at this price. If you're still interested, I'll meet you at $14500. Otherwise, I'll move forward with the sale to John.",14500.0,Alice,9,
