"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than $120 from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation, as it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $80.  This approach balances the desire to get a good price with the risk of losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $105, it's still above your desired price range.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, giving you the opportunity to potentially reach a price closer to your target.  You'll have a couple more rounds before you need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise.  It's higher than your previous offer but still lower than Alice's current offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway.  This could be a good strategy for getting a deal close to your desired price range.  Since this is the middle of the negotiation, you're balancing the need for a fair price with the urgency of closing the deal."
