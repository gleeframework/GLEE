"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000, which is $812,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",825000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, this is getting very close to my limit. I'd be willing to do $790,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.",790000.0,Bob,6,,
