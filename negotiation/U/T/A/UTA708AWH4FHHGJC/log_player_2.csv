"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  You can risk rejecting the offer to see if she'll come down further. You always have John as a backup."
