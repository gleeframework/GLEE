Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a valuable asset at a price that's within your budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $900,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** Highlighting the value of the product and the benefits to Bob can make him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers, but I'll also consider selling to John if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I consider a fair price. I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues the product.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'm prepared to offer the product for $875,000. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial offer, but not by too much.
* **Reiterating value:** Emphasizing the product's value and framing the price as a compromise can make Bob more inclined to accept.
* **Maintaining a margin:** $875,000 is still closer to my desired range and significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to counter with an offer of $860000 for the product. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $860,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable offer of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of losing a deal:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob might completely back out or that I might miss out on selling to John for $1,000,000.
* **Potential for future dealings:** Accepting this offer could lead to future business opportunities with Bob, as he has shown a willingness to negotiate and compromise."
