"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1000000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can potentially get a higher price if I continue negotiating.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $800,000 is a fair starting point, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the value of this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900000 is closer but still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's meet in the middle at $850000.  I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price than his previous offer and still significantly higher than what I would get from John. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
