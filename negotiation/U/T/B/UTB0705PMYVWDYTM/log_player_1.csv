{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for you to negotiate upwards.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about getting a good price, but you're also open to discussion.

By starting with this offer, you can see how Bob reacts and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $13000 if possible. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and within your desired range.  It's a good deal for you, especially considering that John would only pay $12,000.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and maximizes your profit at this stage."
