I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $12,000. I have a few rounds left to negotiate, so I'm not willing to settle for this price yet."
