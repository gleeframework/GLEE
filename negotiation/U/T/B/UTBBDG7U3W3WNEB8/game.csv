"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",11250.0,Alice,5,
