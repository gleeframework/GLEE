I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Bob and at least $10,000 to me.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also willing to negotiate if Bob isn't happy with the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm open to negotiation, $9,500 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further but won't accept a price below what I'm willing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is very close to my ideal price and significantly better than selling to John. I'll accept this offer."
