Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a profit. I'm also keeping the message friendly and encouraging to increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a slightly higher price by engaging in further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 16000}
