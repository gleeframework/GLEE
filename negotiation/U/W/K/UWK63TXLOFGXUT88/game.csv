"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000,  which is still a fair price given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a better offer, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
