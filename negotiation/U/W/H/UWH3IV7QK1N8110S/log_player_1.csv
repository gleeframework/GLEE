{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting at the highest price I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from there. I'm also trying to make the offer appealing by highlighting the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd like to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  John is offering my minimum, so I'm going to sell the product to him instead."
