"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than her product valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to secure a significantly better price."
