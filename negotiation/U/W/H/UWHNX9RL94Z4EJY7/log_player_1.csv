Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of other buyers might entice him.
* **Time Value of Money:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, a quicker sale to him might be preferable over waiting for John's guaranteed purchase. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy involves a calculated risk. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, leading to a slightly lower profit with John. However, the potential for a higher, faster sale to Bob makes it a risk worth considering."
