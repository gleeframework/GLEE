"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $18,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is my best offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is a significant step up from my initial offer. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer for now.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain amount for the product. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is closer to my target price. This is my last offer before I consider other options.",11500.0,Alice,7,
