Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe this product's true value justifies a higher price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $970,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I still want to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and his offer of $950,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. While I could try to push for more, his message suggests he might walk away soon. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of him going with another option."
