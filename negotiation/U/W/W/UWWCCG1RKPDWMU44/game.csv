"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly a strong offer, I believe this product's true value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose $970,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll be gaining.",970000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I still think $970,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I still want to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
