"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for your product, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1700000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1850000, which reflects the value I place on this opportunity while still being within a reasonable range for you. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1850000 is closer to my budget, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm confident that $1750000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
