"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1200000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet the price at $1350000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000 if possible.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
