"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. After reviewing my options, I need to be upfront â€“ my minimum acceptable price is significantly higher than what you've indicated you're willing to pay. Unless you have a revised offer closer to my asking price, I think it's best to be transparent and let you know I'm leaning towards accepting another offer I've received. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
