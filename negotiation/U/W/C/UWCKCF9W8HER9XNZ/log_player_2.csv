"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a fair offer, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it. What do you think?
