Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
It's better to try and get a higher price from Bob.  While $9,500 is a decent amount, I can still potentially get closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still looking for a price closer to $10,000. How about $9,750? That would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. In that case, how about $9,600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to $10,000, Bob is coming up in his offers. Accepting his offer of $9,600 is a good compromise and ensures a sale.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not risking losing out on a significantly better deal."
