Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really value. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $80 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, giving Bob incentive to accept. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** You're not being greedy, but you're also not giving away the farm.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below the $120 you initially offered. You have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price.  You can counteroffer with something in between your initial offer and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise because: 

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** It gives you a better price than Bob's initial offer.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable middle ground:** It aims to bridge the gap and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $105 is a bit high. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $95 is just above your minimum of $80 and is within a reasonable range.  While you might be able to get a slightly higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's always a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
