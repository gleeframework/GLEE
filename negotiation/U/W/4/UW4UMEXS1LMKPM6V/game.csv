"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $12,000 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is still a little low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,750. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to sell the product without sacrificing too much. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
