"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be immensely valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair return for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This price is closer to my budget and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's find a common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your willingness to negotiate.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the substantial value this product will bring to your operations.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  $1,125,000 is still a bit out of my range, but I'm feeling confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm proposing $1,110,000. This price reflects a compromise and allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this deal happen.",1110000.0,Bob,6,
