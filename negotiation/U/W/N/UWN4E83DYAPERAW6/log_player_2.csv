"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $95 is a good deal, but Bob can potentially save more by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

Bob is willing to pay $90 for the product, which is still a fair price for Alice. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $92, which is only $2 more than Bob's counteroffer. It's a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that Alice won't budge further.  Buying from John for $100 would be a worse outcome."
