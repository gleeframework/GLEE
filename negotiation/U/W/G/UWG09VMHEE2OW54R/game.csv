"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
