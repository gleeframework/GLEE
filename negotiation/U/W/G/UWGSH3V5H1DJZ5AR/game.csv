"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This product offers significant long-term value that I'm confident justifies this price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could potentially go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.  However, I also need to be mindful of the product's value. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
