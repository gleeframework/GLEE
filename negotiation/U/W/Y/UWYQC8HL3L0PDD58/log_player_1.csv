Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob and emphasizing that it's a good deal for him. This increases the likelihood of him accepting. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price a bit, but I still have a good margin of profit even if I have to settle for $10,000 or slightly more. 
* **Back-up plan:**  John is my safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to him for $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I still have some room to negotiate and hopefully get a bit closer to my desired price point.
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe Bob may be willing to pay more, as he expressed interest in the product.
* **Gaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer will give me leverage to potentially push for a higher price in the next round.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating position and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Empathy:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns to show that I'm willing to work with him.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the ""great deal"" to remind him of the product's worth.
* **Finality:**  This counteroffer  is a strong indication that I'm not willing to go much lower, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit short on funds. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good compromise, meeting us halfway at our last offer. 
* **Close to desired price:** While not ideal, $10,000 is still a significant profit margin for me.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject, there's a risk that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $8,000. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a reasonable sale price without risking losing the deal entirely."
