"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate you offering your product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $8000?  This is my maximum budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob has set a budget, he is open to negotiation. His initial message suggests a willingness to compromise. 
* **More rounds available:**  I have 8 rounds left to explore a better deal.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum, aiming to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I phrase the message to invite further negotiation and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's getting closer. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final offer, but I'm not convinced.  He might be willing to budge if I push a little further.
* **Time to push:** We're already in round 4, and selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option. However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise that gets me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our current positions, signaling a willingness to find a common ground. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I frame my offer as a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Confidence in Value:** I reiterate my belief in the product's value to justify my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping that this compromise will be appealing to Bob. If he rejects it, I might need to start considering selling to John, as we're quickly running out of rounds."
