"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is significantly higher than his budget of $8,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate you offering your product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  This is my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$10,000 is still above Bob's budget. He should continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. While $9,500 is better than Alice's previous offers, it's still over his budget.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's the most financially sensible choice."
