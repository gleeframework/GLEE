"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you offering your product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $8000?  This is my maximum budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, but that's my final offer. ",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9000. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 isn't quite there yet.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,
