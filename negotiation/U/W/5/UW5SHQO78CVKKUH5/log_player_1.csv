Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,200,000, Bob seems firm on his budget. Accepting $1,125,000 is a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or losing him as a buyer."
