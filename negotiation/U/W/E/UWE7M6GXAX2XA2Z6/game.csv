"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. I believe this is a fair price given its exceptional quality and rarity.",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $600000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it.  This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, and I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $875000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Alice,5,
