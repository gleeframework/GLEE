"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her product's worth to her. There's substantial room for negotiation. It's worthwhile to reject the offer and try to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  This would allow us both to make a solid profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, but still too high.  While we're making progress, I'm confident we can reach a lower price.  Rejecting her offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too steep for me.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a compromise, but it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, $1,025,000 is still above my target. We've established a pattern of negotiation, and I believe I can get her down to a price closer to my target with a few more rounds."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $975,000.

I'm willing to make a slight concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,025,000, which is $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.

Round 9
