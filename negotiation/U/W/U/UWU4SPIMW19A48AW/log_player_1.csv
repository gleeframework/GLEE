"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is truly interested and to gauge his potential budget.  I want to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than my minimum, I still believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows a willingness to negotiate, while still leaving some room for potential further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $13,500. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $15,000,  we're already on round 4. It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $13,500 is still a good profit margin for me, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
