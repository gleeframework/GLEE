"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,000,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This offers a significant value for you while ensuring I'm able to recoup a reasonable portion of the product's worth.  Let's find a way to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
