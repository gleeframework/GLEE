Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,050,000?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $950,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
