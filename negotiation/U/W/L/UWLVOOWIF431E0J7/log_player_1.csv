Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price. I'm also hoping to gauge his interest and see how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I would have preferred to get more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and ending up with only $100 from John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
