"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I know it would be incredibly valuable for you, potentially saving your company thousands of dollars and increasing efficiency. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I understand its potential value. However,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. To start, I'd like to offer you $850,000.  This is a fair price that still allows you a good profit, while ensuring I get a deal that works for me. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. Would you be willing to consider this?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, and I agree it has potential. However, $900,000 is still outside of my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I aim for a deal that benefits us both, I must be firm on the value I bring to the table. Therefore, my final offer is $885,000. This leaves a relatively small gap and ensures we both walk away feeling positive about this transaction. Let me know your decision.",885000.0,Alice,5,
