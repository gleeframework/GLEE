"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure a price closer to my valuation.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know if you're open to this price. ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and the profit I'll make. Let me know if you're open to this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
