"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing an initial price of $20,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly fixated on $12,000 and is unlikely to budge significantly.  It's not worth my time to continue negotiating when I have a guaranteed offer for $15,000 from John."
