"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I'm only willing to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and what I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
