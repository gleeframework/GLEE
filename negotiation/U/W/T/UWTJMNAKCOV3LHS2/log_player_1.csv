Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly higher than your minimum. This strategy creates a good balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 

This is a classic negotiation scenario where understanding the other party's perceived value is key to securing a favorable deal."
