"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer  gives us more room to negotiate upwards and hopefully reach a price closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000, while staying well below our own limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you is $15,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While closer to Alice's value, $12,500 is still above our target price. We've successfully moved Alice down from her initial offer, signaling we're serious buyers, but there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're inching closer to a potential agreement.  By countering with $11,000, we're showing willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range of both our limit and Alice's likely minimum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,500.  This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and we're consistently pushing the price down.  While $11,500 is tempting, it's worth seeing if she'll go even lower with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, and I can tell we're close to a deal. How about we settle this right now at $11,200?  That's a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 11200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to the later rounds, and it's time to signal stronger willingness to close the deal. Offering $11,200 is a reasonable jump from our previous offer and shows Alice we're serious about buying but still want a competitive price.  The slightly uneven number adds a touch of psychological pressure, making it feel like a more considered final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer to a deal.  While $11,200 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $11,300? This is a small difference, but it would help me reach my desired price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $11,300 is a very reasonable price, well below our $15,000 limit. Continuing to negotiate for a small difference at this point carries the risk of Alice backing out or hardening her stance. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out."
