"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I've been thinking a lot about the value it could bring to your business, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
