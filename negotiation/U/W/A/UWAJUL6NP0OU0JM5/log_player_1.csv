{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point because it is more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but it gives him room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product while avoiding being too pushy.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes profit:** $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Allows for negotiation:** By offering a price that leaves room for negotiation, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to my desired value.
* **Protects my minimum value:** If Bob rejects, I can fall back on John's offer of $15,000. 

This strategy aims to find a mutually agreeable price while ensuring I get a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's better than his initial perceived value, $9,500 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** I can still make a profit by negotiating with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a higher price. 
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss compared to what I could potentially get from John or by continuing negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my desired value, but still allows room for further negotiation. My goal is to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've chosen a price that is halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Reasonable offer:** $10,750 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's a realistic price that allows for further negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:**  I'm focusing on the benefits for both of us, highlighting that it's a good deal for both parties.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Staying above my minimum:** $10,750 is still well above my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Encouraging further negotiation:**  By meeting halfway, I'm inviting Bob to counter again, allowing us to converge on a mutually acceptable price.
* **Balancing profits and potential loss:** This strategy balances the desire to maximize profits with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to be closer to your asking price, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, $10,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting would lead to a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for better negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate further with Bob. He has shown a willingness to move closer to my price, and I'm confident I can get an even better deal with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding unnecessary loss:** Selling to John at this point would guarantee $15,000, but I'm not willing to give up on potentially reaching a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price that's still higher than $10,000, but closer to his offer. I'll continue to focus on finding a mutually beneficial solution while staying above my minimum threshold."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying above the minimum:** $10,500 is still above my minimum threshold of $15,000.

* **Balances profit and negotiation:** This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the need to secure a deal and avoid losing Bob as a buyer."
