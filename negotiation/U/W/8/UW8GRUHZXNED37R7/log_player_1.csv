Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential surplus of $500,000 to negotiate.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob.  If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's appealing to Bob (significantly below his $1,500,000 valuation) while maximizing your own profit. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with ""exclusive opportunity"" subtly emphasizes the potential loss if Bob declines.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant return on investment"" focuses on the benefits to Bob rather than just the price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 discount (enough to be enticing) while giving you a $350,000 profit over your fallback option.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  Factors like your risk tolerance and any prior knowledge about Bob's negotiating style could influence your strategy."
