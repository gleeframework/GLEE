"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is better than $100, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close as possible to Alice's valuation of $80. This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for some potential profit for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm looking to get closer to $90 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as low a price as possible. While $90 is better than $95, it's still above his ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm really hoping to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his desire to get a lower price but is also showing a willingness to compromise.  He's now offering a price that's closer to Alice's desired price point while still being a good deal for himself. This counteroffer should encourage Alice to accept, but if not, he can continue negotiating in future rounds."
