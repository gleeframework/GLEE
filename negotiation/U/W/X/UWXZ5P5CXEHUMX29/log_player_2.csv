It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, aiming for a substantial discount. This counteroffer should be a good starting point for negotiation."

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject her offer and try to push for a lower price."

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also willing to compromise. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement within this price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and I'd be stuck with John's price.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price."
