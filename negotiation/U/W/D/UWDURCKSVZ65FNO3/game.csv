"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset that will be a great addition to your holdings. Let's start the negotiation with this offer.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to get for this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows for a good return for me while also being a fair deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $1,075,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down further to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me.  Let's close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can tell we're both motivated to get this done. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
