"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your target, it's still above your desired maximum of $120. You have a few rounds left, so it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a little too high for me.  I'm really hoping to get this under $90. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $98. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $95 and $92.50. How about we settle on $93.75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $93.75 is just above your target price of $90. However, you only have 5 rounds remaining, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
