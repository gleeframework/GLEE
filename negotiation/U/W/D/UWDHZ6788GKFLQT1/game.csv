"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000. This is a significant discount from its true value, but I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.  Let me know what you think.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $15000 is significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $18000? This reflects the unique value of the product and provides a good starting point for further discussion.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $18000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'd like to make another counteroffer of $16500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer. While $16500 is an improvement, it's still a bit below my bottom line.  To continue the negotiations, I'm willing to come down to $17000. This reflects the unique value of the product while acknowledging your budgetary constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,
