"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $115.  While this is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $110 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to negotiate. This price is still within Bob's maximum budget of $120 and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
