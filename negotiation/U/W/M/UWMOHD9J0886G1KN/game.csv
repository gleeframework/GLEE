"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure I can go as low as $95. How about we try $105? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not sure I can go to $105. How about we meet at $98? It's a bit higher than my previous offers, but I'm willing to compromise.",98.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $98. How about we try $108? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, to be honest. I was really interested in the product, but I don't think I can go to $108. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $108, which is $104. Can you consider that?",104.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $100, and I've already made that clear. I'm starting to think it's not worth it for me to continue negotiating. I think I'll pass on the product and go with John's offer for $80. Thanks for the opportunity, though!",100.0,Bob,10,
