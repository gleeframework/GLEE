Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me is around $1,000,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm willing to negotiate further."

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. $875,000 is still significantly below my initial offer and not close enough to my minimum of $800,000. I believe I can still negotiate a better price."

**Reasoning:**

While I want to get the best price possible, Bob's offer of $845,000 is below my minimum. With only one round remaining, there's no time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John for $800,000 is the best option at this point.  This ensures I at least meet my minimum and secure a sale."
