"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price:**  You are willing to pay no more than $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $13,500.
* **You can get it cheaper from John:** You can buy the same product from John for $15,000, which is still within your budget. 

Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option, as you can get a better deal from John."
