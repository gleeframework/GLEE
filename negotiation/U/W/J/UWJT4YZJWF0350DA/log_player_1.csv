Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to get Bob to budge."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,100,000 is too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product offers you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could we settle at $1,150,000?  That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
