"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $150. I believe it's a fantastic deal and worth every penny. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $80. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its worth to you is $100. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $80 is quite low for what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $120. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $100 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to pay a premium, but not that high. Can we meet somewhere in between, like $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
