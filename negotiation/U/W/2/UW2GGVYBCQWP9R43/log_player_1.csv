"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $80.  I'm also framing the message to highlight the potential value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $95.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $105.  This is still a great price for the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 
I'm offering $105, which is still a decent profit for me while showing flexibility to Bob. I'm emphasizing the value he'll get from the product to further encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is still a good deal for you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $100.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, $100 is a good compromise and still yields a profit for me.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially with the option of selling to John for $80."
