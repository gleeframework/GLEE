"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good starting point, you have room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  You haven't exhausted your options yet, and rejecting the offer allows you to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer will show Alice that you are serious about negotiating.  This initial counteroffer is a strong starting point, but still leaves room for compromise.  It also avoids being too aggressive and potentially alienating Alice early in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, and you've already made a significant saving compared to John's price.  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate or a worse outcome."
