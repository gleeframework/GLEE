"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity to consider this product. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,500,000 asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. It represents a substantial loss for me.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,300,000 is too high for me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
