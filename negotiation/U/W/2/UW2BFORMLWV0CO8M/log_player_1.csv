Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the opportunity to consider this product. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,500,000 asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $750,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. It represents a substantial loss for me.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $1,300,000 is too high for me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is my maximum budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"" 
}
``` 

Bob is now offering more than John. Accepting this offer maximizes profit at this stage."
