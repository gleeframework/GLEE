Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value of $100. This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me.  I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm reducing my price to $135. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still gives me a decent profit. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is getting close to my initial counteroffer of $135, and it's a good amount more than what I would get by selling to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer and end the negotiation."
