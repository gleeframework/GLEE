"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept anything close to Alice's first offer. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It leaves room for you to increase your offer gradually while still aiming for a price well below your $8,000 limit.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she's completely unreceptive to an offer this low, you'll know you need to increase your bids more substantially or consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product is worth a lot more based on its features and benefits.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in her offer, but it's still at her perceived value of the product.  You know you have a backup option at $8,000, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you consider $7,500? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Alice you are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary close to your maximum limit. 
* **Finding a Compromise:** By suggesting $7,500, you're aiming for a price that's a significant increase from your previous offer but still allows you to save some money compared to John's deal.
* **Limited Time:**  With each round, you should become slightly more aggressive to encourage Alice to either meet your price point or allow you to move on to John's offer before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $7,500 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $9,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky spot. Alice has come down considerably and labeled this as her ""final offer."" However, you're only $1,000 away from John's price. There's still a chance, even if it's slim, that Alice might budge a bit more. You're willing to take that gamble for one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm ready to close this deal today, but $9,000 is just outside my reach. If you're able to come down to $8,000, I'll accept immediately.  Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  You're now matching John's offer, making this effectively your final offer as well. 
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning you'll explore other options, you subtly remind Alice that time is a factor, and you're willing to walk away. 
* **Clean Break:** This counteroffer provides clarity. Either you get the product at your target price, or you move on to John's guaranteed offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm trying to be as flexible as possible.  How about this: to make this deal happen right now, I'll come down to $8,500.  This is a significant discount, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $8,500. While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, you've reached a point where the potential savings ($500) are not worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $8,000 deal from John. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the price you know you can get."
