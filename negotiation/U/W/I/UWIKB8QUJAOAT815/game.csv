"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer of $90, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $120. How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, so how about $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
