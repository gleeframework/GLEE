"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,500 is more than what John is offering, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $9,000. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,750. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like a bit more, $8,750 is getting very close to my desired price range. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential rejection, especially since it's significantly higher than what John is offering."
