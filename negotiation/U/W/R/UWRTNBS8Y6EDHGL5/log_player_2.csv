You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

While $110 is closer to your budget, you can still potentially get it for less. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before you go with John."
