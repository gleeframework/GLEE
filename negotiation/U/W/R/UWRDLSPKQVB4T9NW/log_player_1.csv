``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $9,500 is a good price and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's time to finalize the deal!"
