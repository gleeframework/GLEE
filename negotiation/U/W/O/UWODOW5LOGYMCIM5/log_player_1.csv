Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

The product is worth $150 to me, and Bob's offer is only $120. While I could accept and make some profit, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

While $110 is better than $100, I'm still losing money on the deal. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since Bob is willing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better offer from Bob. It's clear he's not willing to pay much more than $100.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150, it makes more sense to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
