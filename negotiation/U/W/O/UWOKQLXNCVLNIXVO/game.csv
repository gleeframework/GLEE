"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for you, given its value, and it allows me to get a fair price for my hard work. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,050,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a great deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to be flexible, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $975,000? That's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Let's meet at $990,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down further. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $987,500? That's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget.",987500.0,Bob,6,
