Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $150.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $150.

Since you can get $150 from John, there's no incentive to offer the product to Bob for less than that. However,  offering it slightly above Bob's valuation might entice him while still leaving you with a profit. 

By offering the product at $120, you're:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Giving him a chance to buy it for less than your minimum.
* **Below John's Offer:** Still securing a profit if Bob accepts. 

This strategy maximizes your chances of a sale while aiming for the highest possible profit."
