Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price ($8,000).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 allows us to potentially gain a $2,000 profit above our minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While we aim high, the message implies some flexibility (""This is a great deal..."") potentially leading to a counteroffer from Bob that is still profitable for us.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning listing the product publicly subtly reminds Bob that we have other options if he rejects the offer. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
