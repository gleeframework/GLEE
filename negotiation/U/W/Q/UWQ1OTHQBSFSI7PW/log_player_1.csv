Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to part with the product for $1,500,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,499,999 could potentially work.

**The Goal:**  To find the highest price Bob is willing to pay within that negotiation space.

**The Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a significant asset to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing exclusivity and value to pique Bob's interest.
* **High Anchor:**  We're starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the upper end of the possible range.
* **Confidence:** The tone is confident but not aggressive, suggesting the price is justified by the product's worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob tends to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (but still above your minimum). 
* **Market Information:** If you had reason to believe Bob might be desperate for this product, you could push closer to $1,500,000. However, with the information provided, a more balanced approach is recommended."
