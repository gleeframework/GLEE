Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not budging much on her price.  The deal with John offers a guaranteed purchase within Bob's budget. While a slightly better deal might be possible, Bob has to weigh the risk of continuing the negotiation against the certainty of getting the product from John.  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of Alice not agreeing to a better price becomes too high."
