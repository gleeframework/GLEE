"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you place on the product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
