Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's potential to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while acknowledging the value you place on the product. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,450,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel we can find a better middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. This offers a slight compromise that might help us reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept.  I have 6 rounds left and the potential to get a higher price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,425,000.

Round 6

With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting Bob's offer of $1,410,000 is a good choice.  It's a solid deal, and I can avoid the risk of further negotiations that could lead to a lower price or a failed deal."
