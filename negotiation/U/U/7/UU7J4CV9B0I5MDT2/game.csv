"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and the discussion.  While $1,500,000 is certainly a strong starting point, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $1,650,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,650,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,500,000 and $1,650,000, so I'll offer $1,575,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1575000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're definitely right that we're getting closer.  To meet you partway, how about $1,612,500? I believe that strikes a fair balance and reflects the true value of this product.",1612500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, but I'd like to propose a slight reduction to $1,587,500. I believe this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1587500.0,Bob,6,
