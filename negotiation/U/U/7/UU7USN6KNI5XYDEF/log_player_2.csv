"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $14,000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I do see its potential benefits. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the value and quality of the item. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. $13,000 is better than $15,000, but he can still try to push for a lower price.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, so there's a chance Alice might come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. Considering the value and quality of the product, I propose a final price of $12,800. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. I hope we can finalize this transaction soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down to $12,800, which is lower than John's price of $15,000. This is a good deal for Bob, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that meets his budget while also ending the negotiation."
