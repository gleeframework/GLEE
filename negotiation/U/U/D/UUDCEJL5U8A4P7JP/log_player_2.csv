"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a fair agreement. I propose selling the product to you for $100. This is a special offer tailored to recognize the high value you place on this item. Please let me know if this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your maximum value:** $120
* **Alice's offer:** $100
* **John's offer:** $120

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, you can still get the product from John for your maximum value.  You can potentially negotiate with Alice further, but rejecting the offer keeps your options open for a better deal."
