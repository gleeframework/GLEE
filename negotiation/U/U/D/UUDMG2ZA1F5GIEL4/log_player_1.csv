"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to maximize my profit.  While $17,000 is above what Bob values the product at, it's still below what I'd get from John. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully allows us to close a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make more than $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob at $15,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, as I can always sell to John for that amount. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also mindful of the limited rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to compromise a little bit and offer $14,000. It's a good middle ground between my last offer and Bob's current offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
