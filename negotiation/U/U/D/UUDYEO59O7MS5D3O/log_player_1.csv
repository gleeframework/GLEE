"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it a potentially attractive offer.  It also gives me some room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, but it is still above my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'll reject his offer for now and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility, but still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'll reject it and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway.  I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if we can bridge the gap in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation if necessary. I'm hoping that after rejecting my last offer, Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob consistently offering lower prices, it's becoming clear that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a sale and secures my minimum threshold."
