"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it holds immense value. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for your product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product has significant value and I believe $1750000 is a fair price reflecting that. It's a good compromise between our initial positions, allowing us to close the deal and make this mutually beneficial. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1750000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1600000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of this product. This is a significant offer, and I truly believe it's in both our interests to close this deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1400000, which reflects a significant move from my previous offer. Let's keep negotiating and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to close the deal at $1500000.  This would ensure a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize the sale.  Considering our progress, I believe this is a reasonable compromise and a great opportunity for both of us.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1500000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
