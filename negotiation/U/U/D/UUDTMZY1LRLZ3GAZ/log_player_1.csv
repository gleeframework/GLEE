Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to offer it at a price of $13,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $13,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price and significantly exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly pressure Bob to make a decision without being too aggressive.
* **Highlighting Value:**  While not going into specifics, reminding Bob of the product's benefit keeps him interested. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, you might adjust your offer."
