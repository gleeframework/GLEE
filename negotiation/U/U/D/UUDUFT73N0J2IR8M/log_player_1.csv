Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This means we have some room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Our Minimum:** We want at least $1,200,000.
* **First Offer Strategy:**  By offering $1,450,000, we start the negotiation close to our desired price, leaving room for potential counteroffers and bargaining.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 provides a safety net. If the negotiation with Bob falls apart, we have a guaranteed buyer.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while leaving room for flexibility in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to our minimum of $1,200,000, it's still below our preferred price range. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's a chance we can secure a higher price by making a counteroffer. We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, we're aiming for more.  The risk of losing Bob as a buyer is balanced by the potential for a higher price.

This decision prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the risk involved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Our Goal:** Our ideal price remains $1,450,000, but we need to compromise slightly given Bob's counteroffer.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By offering $1,400,000, we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to our initial offer. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This counteroffer balances the risk of losing Bob as a buyer with the potential for a price closer to our preferred range.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving and hopefully secure a price closer to our initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum of $1,200,000, it's still below our preferred price range. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's still room for negotiation. 
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, which is now very close to Bob's offer. However, there's a chance we can still get a higher price from Bob.

**Decision:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:** We believe there's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer allows us to continue bargaining. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** We'll aim for a compromise price that's still above our minimum but closer to Bob's offer.  We'll need to be careful as we're getting close to the price we'd accept from John.

This decision aims to maximize profit while minimizing the risk of losing both Bob and John as buyers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, and we're nearing his valuation.
* **Our Minimum:** We're at our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering $1,200,000, making this our fallback option.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  By offering $1,350,000, we're meeting Bob halfway while still securing a profit. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This counteroffer acknowledges the risk of losing Bob but offers a fair price that could be acceptable to him. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that balances our desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,290,000 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. The potential profit difference is minimal.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries a significant risk. He has already rejected multiple offers, suggesting he may be unwilling to compromise further.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees us a profit of $1,200,000, which meets our minimum requirement.

**Decision:**

* **Sell to John:**  The minimal potential gain from further negotiation with Bob does not outweigh the risk of losing the sale altogether. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and minimizes the risk of a failed negotiation.

This decision prioritizes certainty over potential, recognizing that a guaranteed sale is a safer and more reliable outcome in this scenario."
