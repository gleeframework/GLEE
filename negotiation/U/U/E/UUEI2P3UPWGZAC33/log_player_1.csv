Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $14,000 is higher than Bob's valuation of $12,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $14,000 is above your minimum of $15,000, so you're still getting a decent profit. 
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  Bob may accept, or he may counter-offer. This will give you information to work with as you continue the negotiations.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to go for a quick sale, it's important to remember that you can do better. You can still negotiate with Bob, or you can sell to John for a higher price. 

Since you're committed to maximizing your profit, rejecting Bob's offer is the best option at this stage. It allows you to maintain your negotiation leverage and potentially achieve a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a compromise:**  You're moving closer to Bob's offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still above your minimum:** $13,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring you get a decent return.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price a bit more, but you're not giving away too much.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that both of you are happy with. Keep in mind your minimum acceptable price and John's offer, as they serve as your negotiation anchors."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $12,750? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your preferred price point and you're not under pressure to sell.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000.  Therefore, it's best to reject this offer and see if you can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $12,750 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good move:

* **It's a smaller step:** You're not giving away too much,  just $250 less than your previous offer. This shows Bob that you're serious about making a deal, but you're not desperate.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $13,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring a decent profit.
* **It leaves room for a final compromise:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price again, but you've already shown flexibility.

Remember, the key is to be assertive while remaining open to negotiation. Don't be afraid to counter-offer, and always keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
