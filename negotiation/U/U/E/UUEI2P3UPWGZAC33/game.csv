"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $12,750? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a tight budget, but $12,750 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",13500.0,Alice,5,
