Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $130 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $130 is less than what Bob values the product at ($150), so he has an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's room for both of you to negotiate and find a price that works for both parties. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than selling to John for $100,  it's still significantly lower than your initial offer of $130.  There's room to negotiate further, potentially getting closer to your ideal price.  

**Next steps:**

You should counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than $130, but higher than $110. This shows you're willing to compromise but still value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $120 for this product.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still securing a decent profit.
* **Appealing to value:**  You're reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal at this price.
* **Closing the deal:**  Urgency can sometimes be a good tactic to incentivize a final decision."
