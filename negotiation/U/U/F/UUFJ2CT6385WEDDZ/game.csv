"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about we split the difference and agree on $1,012,500? It's a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired amount. Let me know your thoughts.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
