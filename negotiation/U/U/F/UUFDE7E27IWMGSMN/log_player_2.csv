"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. You have a better option with John, who is selling the same product for your desired price.  There's no need to negotiate further with Alice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $100. This is the price I'm willing to pay, and it aligns with my goal of saving as much money as possible.  If she rejects this offer, I'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $110 is closer to my desired price, but it's still outside of my budget.  Since I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, it makes more sense to go with that option. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially end up paying more."
