I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's a price that's below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I still make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired profit margin."
