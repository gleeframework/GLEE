Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This price point increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, but this strategy balances risk and potential reward."
