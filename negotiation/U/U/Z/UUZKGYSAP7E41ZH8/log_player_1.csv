Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good midpoint between my minimum and Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate if needed, but also allows me to potentially secure a good deal right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I can only pay $90 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum selling price of $80, and I want to avoid potentially losing him as a buyer.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
