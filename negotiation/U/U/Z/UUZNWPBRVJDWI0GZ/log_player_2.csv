"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However,  $130 is a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is meeting us halfway, and $115 is a reasonable price. It's better to accept now and save the $35 difference rather than risk her raising the price again."
