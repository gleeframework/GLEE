"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $10,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get as close to my budget as possible. Can we discuss further?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're serious about acquiring it, let's close this deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to make one final offer of $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and I'd like to make it work. Let me know if this is something we can agree on.",9200.0,Bob,6,
