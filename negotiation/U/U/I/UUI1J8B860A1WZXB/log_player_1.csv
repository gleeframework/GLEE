Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Optimistic, but Fair:** $170 is a good starting point, as it's closer to my value than Bob's.  It's also a realistic price considering the value I place on the product.
* **Friendly Tone:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in buying it for $100. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and even below his own estimated value of $80.  Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Counter-offering is a better strategy.** I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob.  There's a chance he might be willing to increase his offer, and even if he doesn't, I can use the counter-offer to gauge his seriousness and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John is always an option.**  I haven't ruled out selling to John, but I want to exhaust my options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:**  I'm explaining the rationale behind my counter-offer, reminding Bob of the product's value.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $115?  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Selling at this price would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob seems interested in closing the deal.  I can likely get him to come up a bit more by rejecting his offer and making a counter-offer.
* **John is a safe option:** I haven't forgotten about John. He's always there as a guarantee of my minimum price, but I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before I resort to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. 
* **Fair Compromise:** $125 is a compromise that's still above my minimum but potentially acceptable to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and encouraging tone to keep Bob engaged. 
* **Opportunity to Close:** This counter-offer might be the sweet spot to close the deal, as it's a reasonable compromise for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really want to make this deal work, but $125 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $120. This is my final offer. Let's finalize this! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below minimum:** While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $150.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Negotiation reached a stalemate:** Bob has made his ""final offer,"" and there's a good chance further negotiation won't yield a better result.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal. 

It's time to move on and secure a deal that ensures I meet my minimum price goals."
