Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,300,000. I know it's valuable to both of us, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his eagerness.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I'm providing a reason that suggests the value is even higher than his perceived $1,000,000. This might encourage him to counter-offer closer to my asking price. 
* **Alternative:** I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's offers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Invested:** Bob's rejection wasn't a flat ""no."" He expressed interest and provided a counter-offer, signaling he's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $900,000 is lower than I'd like, it's still a significant amount above my minimum. There's space to negotiate towards a price closer to $1,000,000.
* **John as Leverage:**  I'll keep John in mind as a fallback. If Bob's offers remain too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product is truly significant.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to his price point. A $200,000 reduction shows flexibility.
* **Holding Firm:** While I'm being flexible, I'm still holding firm above my minimum of $1,000,000, aiming for a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Clear and Concise:** I'm keeping the communication straightforward and positive, encouraging a continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob's counter-offers are increasing, but at a very slow pace.  We're still significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time. Each round spent with Bob is an opportunity cost, preventing me from pursuing other deals or utilizing the funds from the sale.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed $1,000,000.  While there's a chance I could squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away entirely. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes a sure thing is better than a potentially higher, but less certain, outcome."
