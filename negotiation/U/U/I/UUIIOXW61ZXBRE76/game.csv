"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000, given its value proposition. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we settle on $18,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial price and reflects the true value of this product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $17,000?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",17000.0,Bob,4,
