I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and still above my minimum.  There's a risk in continuing to negotiate and I don't want to lose the sale entirely."
