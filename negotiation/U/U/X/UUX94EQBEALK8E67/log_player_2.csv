"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's starting price is too high. There's a lot of room for negotiation before considering paying close to John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also expresses a level of interest while being firm about budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm flexible and want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above the halfway point between her initial offer and our counter-offer. There's room to negotiate further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer holds firm to a price closer to our target while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. It keeps the negotiation moving without conceding too much ground."
