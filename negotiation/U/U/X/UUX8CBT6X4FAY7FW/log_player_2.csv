"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have 10 rounds and the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door to potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  A $2,000 discount is a good starting point, but I'm prepared to adjust depending on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not at my ideal price point. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get closer to my $10,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer by $500, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a good deal.  This should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still within the range of what I'm willing to pay, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.  I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to inch closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by only $250.  I'm trying to signal to Alice that I'm getting close to my limit, but still want to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now very close to my target price of $10,000. Accepting this offer saves me $100 compared to my last counteroffer and $1,100 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and with only 3 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the chance to buy from Alice."
