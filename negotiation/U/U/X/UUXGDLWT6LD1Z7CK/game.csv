"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $600,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $400,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $400,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $550,000. This is a compromise that I think is still a great value for both of us. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $475,000? That's a significant step up from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",475000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $475,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $525,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",525000.0,Alice,5,
