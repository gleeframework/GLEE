Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $11,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's still less than what it's worth to me. This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:** If I offered a much higher price, it would be less likely he'd accept and would probably just make a counteroffer right away. 
* **It's friendly:** Starting with a friendly message shows that I'm open to negotiation and building a good relationship.

I'm prepared to counteroffer if he rejects this offer, but ultimately, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $9,500? It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $10,000. I'll counteroffer him, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if he doesn't come up to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's still a good deal for both of us, considering what the product is worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering Bob a price that's still above his value but closer to what I want. This shows I'm open to negotiating but not giving away too much. The message is still friendly to keep the conversation positive. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell to John, as it's getting closer to my minimum price."
