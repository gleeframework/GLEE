Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He values the product at $80, so $100 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so you have some wiggle room to go lower.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $65 is far too low for me, especially since I'm willing to sell to John for $120. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
This counteroffer is a good compromise because:

* **It's a fair price:** It's halfway between Bob's offer of $65 and my previous offer of $100.
* **It shows flexibility:** I'm willing to come down in price, but not too much.
* **It keeps the negotiation going:** I'm not giving up, and I'm hoping to get a deal that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is closer but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75? That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I believe I can get a better deal by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this, but $75 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we're both meeting in the middle."", ""product_price"": 82.50} 
```

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a clear compromise:** It's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's offer ($75).
* **It shows willingness to negotiate:** I'm actively trying to find a price that works for both of us.
* **It sets a clear deadline:** By splitting the difference, I'm making it clear that this is my final offer."
