"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 is closer but still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $75? That would work for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you sticking with this, but $75 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $82.50?  That way we're both meeting in the middle.",82.5,Alice,5,
