You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $85.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, Bob. I can do $82.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting at $82.50 secures a reasonable deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially failing."
