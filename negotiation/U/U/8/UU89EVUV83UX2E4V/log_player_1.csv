Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a price closer to $1,200,000.  I have 9 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and can still get a better price.  I'm willing to work with him but I won't settle for $950,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and allows for a good profit margin for you. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This price gives you a healthy profit and allows me to get a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not yet willing to settle.  I have 6 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original price.  How about $1,075,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal and avoids going to John.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This time I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than what I hoped for, it's a good price considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  Accepting this offer will also prevent me from having to sell to John at a significantly lower price."
