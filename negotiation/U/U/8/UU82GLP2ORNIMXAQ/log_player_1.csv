Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I appreciate your offer, $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That's still a fantastic deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference - $12,750. I believe that's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal for a product you value at $15,000."", ""product_price"": 12750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $12750. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $12500. How about we try $12625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting very close to my desired price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer secures a solid profit."
