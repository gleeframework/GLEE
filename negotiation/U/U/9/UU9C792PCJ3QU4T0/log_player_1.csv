Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, as it's above my minimum price of $10,000 and below Bob's perceived value of $15,000. I'm aiming to maximize my earnings while still leaving space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. Bob's interest in the product suggests there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  I'm confident this price is fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $12000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11000. How about $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, $11,500 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer and it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that could potentially lower the price."
