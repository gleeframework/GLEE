{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $15,000. It's a steal at this price, given its value and potential. I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a great opportunity for Bob, highlighting the value and potential of the product. This can make him more likely to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to negotiation, which can encourage Bob to counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm confident this product will be worth more to you in the long run.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering the value and potential of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but offering a counter-proposal that's still significantly higher than my absolute minimum.

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway. This can make him feel like he's getting a better deal and encourage him to accept."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  How about $11,500?  It's a fair price considering the value and potential of this product.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  I'm acknowledging that Bob's offer is getting more reasonable and I'm moving my price closer to his.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $11500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to pay $10800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer a bit more, Bob's offer of $10,800 is only $800 less than my desired price. Given the potential for further negotiation failures and the risk of needing to settle with John at $10,000, it's best to accept this offer and secure a sale."
