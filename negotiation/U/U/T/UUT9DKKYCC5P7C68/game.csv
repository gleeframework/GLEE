"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,750. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $8,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I think we're very close now! I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I'd like to propose a small premium for the hassle-free transaction. How about we settle at $8,100? I think it's a fair price considering the convenience and value the product brings to you.",8100.0,Alice,7,
