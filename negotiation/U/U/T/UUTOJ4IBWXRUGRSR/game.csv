"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for you. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $750000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $750000 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm offering to sell the product for $850000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a more realistic figure given your needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $800000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,
