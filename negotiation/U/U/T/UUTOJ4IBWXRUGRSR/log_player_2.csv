"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000. It's a steal considering its true value, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, there's no way to know if this is a ""steal"" or not.  It's always worth negotiating, especially when the price is at your maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go as high as $750,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** A counteroffer significantly lower than the initial price is a common tactic to start the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the counteroffer (""a bit steep"") adds credibility and shows you're taking the negotiation seriously.
* **Show Interest:** Mentioning your interest in the product keeps the door open for a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $750000 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm offering to sell the product for $850000. This price still reflects the value I see in the product, but it's a more realistic figure given your needs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price by continuing to bargain.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but are still trying to get a better price. 
* **Final Offer:**  Stating this is your final offer adds pressure to Alice to close the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
