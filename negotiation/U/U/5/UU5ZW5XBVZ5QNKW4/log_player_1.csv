{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price increases the chances of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $110 is still a significant profit margin for me (almost a $30 profit). This price also leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, as it's $10 less than what he might expect to pay.
* **""Special Offer"" Framing:** By presenting this price as a special offer just for Bob, it adds a sense of exclusivity and might make him more inclined to accept."
