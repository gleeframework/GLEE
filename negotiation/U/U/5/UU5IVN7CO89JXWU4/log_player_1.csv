{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested, or if you have any counteroffers."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still reasonable for Bob.  This allows room for negotiation, but also sets a clear starting point. I've included a friendly message to encourage communication and collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. I hope this price aligns better with what you're expecting. If not, please let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $950,000, I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,100,000? This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still keeping a margin for profit.  I've also added a message to reiterate that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the adjustment, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a potential compromise. I hope this offer is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum of $1,000,000 and a good profit margin. While I could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the sale altogether to John or further rounds of negotiation is not worth it. Accepting this offer secures a successful sale."
