"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. My starting price is $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product, and if not, we can discuss a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation. I am willing to pay up to $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $125 because I need to make at least $120 to make it worthwhile. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
 
I'm still trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. This counteroffer is a fair compromise that should allow us to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and am willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my desired price range, and it's a better deal than selling to John for $120. It's also important to consider that we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation. Continuing to negotiate risks going below my minimum, or getting into a lengthy back-and-forth that could lead to Bob rejecting further offers."
