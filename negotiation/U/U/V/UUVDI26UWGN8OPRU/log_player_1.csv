"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value of $15,000.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my need to cover my costs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $12,750? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $12,750 is a good price, it's still not enough for me to feel comfortable. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, which is more in line with my minimum value.  It's time to move on."
