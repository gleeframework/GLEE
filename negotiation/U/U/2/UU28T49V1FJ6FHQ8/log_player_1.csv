Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to be negotiated.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  Bob has one chance to accept; this impacts how aggressive you can be.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of that surplus value, without pricing Bob out completely.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 secures you $150,000 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" adds perceived worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, you leave room for Bob to counter-offer if he finds it slightly too high. 

**Important:** This is just one possible approach. You could start higher, but be prepared to potentially lower your price if Bob shows resistance."
