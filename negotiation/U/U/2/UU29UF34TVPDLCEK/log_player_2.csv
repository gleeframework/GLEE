Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go as low as $110, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $110, I'll consider it a done deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $110.  It's a decent price, but I can get it for my target price of $100 from John. It's time to cut my losses with Alice and go with the guaranteed deal."
