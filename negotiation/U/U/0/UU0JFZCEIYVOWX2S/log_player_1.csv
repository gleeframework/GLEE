Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (e.g., $250) might make Bob immediately lose interest. A price of $175 leaves a reasonable chance he'll accept while still netting a good profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value"" subtly implies the product is worth the price and encourages Bob to consider its benefits rather than just the cost. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale with Bob, avoiding the need to sell to John at the lower price."
