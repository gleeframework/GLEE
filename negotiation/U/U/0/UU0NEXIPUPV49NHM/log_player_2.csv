Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way outside my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $5,000 for this product. What's the best you can do?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This is my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this product has value, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I can do $6,500, but that's my absolute limit."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're not seeing eye to eye here.  I need to make a worthwhile sale. $15,000 is my absolute bottom line. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's unlikely to go much lower than $15,000. While she might budge a little, it's not worth risking a worse deal. You have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, which saves you significant money."
