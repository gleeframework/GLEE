"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This would still be a good deal for you, and allows me to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to get closer to the value you place on it.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more to me, but I'm still not comfortable going that high.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,125,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,125,000 and my initial offer of $1,200,000, which would be $1,162,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm willing to accept it.",1162500.0,Alice,5,
