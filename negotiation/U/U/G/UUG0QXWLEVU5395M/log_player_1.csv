"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to build rapport with Bob and make the negotiation feel less adversarial. 
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to me to subtly imply its worth. 
* **Leaving Room:** By offering a price higher than what I need, I give Bob space to negotiate down and feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $65 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100.  While I'd prefer to sell to him, it's too risky to accept such a low offer. I'll reject it and counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum while leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **Value Reminder:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my price is still reasonable.
* **Compromise:** I'm using language like ""willing to come down"" to show flexibility and encourage Bob to see this as a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm getting closer, how about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer, $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell the product for less than my minimum. I'll reject his offer and make another counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible.  $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise price by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Flexibility:** I'm emphasizing that I'm trying to be flexible and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Urgency:** I'm starting to subtly suggest that we need to come to an agreement soon with phrases like ""Let's meet in the middle"". 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer, how about we split the difference and do $80? This will save us both time haggling. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. While I'd love to get more, I'm running out of time and John is a reliable buyer. Accepting this offer will save me the time and uncertainty of further negotiation, and it's a good outcome considering the situation."
