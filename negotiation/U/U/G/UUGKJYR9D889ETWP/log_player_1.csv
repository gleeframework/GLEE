Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal but still leaving room for negotiation.  This also leaves some buffer if Bob counters with a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $13,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's perceived value and closer to my minimum.  It's also a quicker sale than waiting to counteroffer or selling to John."
