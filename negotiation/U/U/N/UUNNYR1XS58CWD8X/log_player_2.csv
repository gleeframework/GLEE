"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by you. Considering its exceptional quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $140 for it. This offer allows you to enjoy significant savings while still getting a great deal on an item you're eager to purchase. Please let me know if this proposal suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her.  There's a chance she might be willing to go down further, getting you a better deal."
