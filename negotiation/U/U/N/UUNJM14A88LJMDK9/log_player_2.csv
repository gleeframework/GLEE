"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that I believe will be mutually beneficial. I'm confident it's worth at least $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects that value. Let's discuss a figure that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly anchoring her offer at your maximum valuation ($800,000). While her message hints at negotiation, starting at your top price leaves you no room to save money.  Rejecting her offer opens the door for a counter-offer where she might lower the price to make the deal more appealing.  You're not losing anything by rejecting since you have John as a backup option."
