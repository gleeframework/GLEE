,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $160.  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. Let me know if you're interested.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $135?",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think $135 is a good starting point.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $145? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",145.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I could go up to $140, but that's really the most I can do.",140.0,Bob,6,
