"Bob, I understand you're looking to keep costs down, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $980,000. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product and leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",980000.0,Alice,3,
