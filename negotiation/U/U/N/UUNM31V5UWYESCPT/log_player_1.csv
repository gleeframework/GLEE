Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my minimum ($1,200,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter, allowing the negotiation to progress.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I will need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  I believe there's a good chance I can push Bob higher with a counteroffer. I'm not desperate to sell and can risk a few more negotiation rounds.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as an alternative buyer gives me the confidence to hold firm and potentially squeeze more value from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to keep costs down, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $980,000. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product and leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It's closer to Bob's offer, but still above his initial price point.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value he'll get from the product, reinforcing that my price is reasonable.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm using positive language (""find common ground"") to keep the negotiation friendly and focused on a win-win outcome.

**Next Steps:**

My goal is to reach a price closer to $1,000,000.  I'll carefully consider Bob's next response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $960,000 for your product. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin for you while keeping my expenses within budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** $960,000 is very close to my initial target of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, I'm concerned about Bob walking away entirely.  It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer from him.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as an option provides a safety net. If this deal falls through, I can still get my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It secures a good price and minimizes the risk of losing a sale. I can always try to negotiate a slightly higher price with John if this deal doesn't work out."
