Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not ready to drop my price that far yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to make a good profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $1,350,000 as a fair price for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still committed to $1,500,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows you to make a profit.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, after careful consideration, I am willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that respects the value of the product while also considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've been negotiating for a while, and I'm not convinced Bob is going to come up to my price.  To avoid risking further negotiation, I'm going to take John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,500,000."
