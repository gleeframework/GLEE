I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price might be attractive enough for Bob to consider while still leaving me with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While I would like to close the deal, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit margin that's closer to my minimum goal. I'm hoping this price will be more appealing to Bob and allow us to reach an agreement."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will counter-offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves me with a profit that's closer to my minimum goal. I believe this offer might be acceptable to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement."
