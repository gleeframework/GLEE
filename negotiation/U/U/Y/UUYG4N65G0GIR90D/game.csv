"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working with a budget.  While $8,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $8,500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,800.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  What do you say?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, and $8,800 is a good step closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,600. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price point. $8,600 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. How about we split the difference and go with $8,700? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal.",8700.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $8,700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $8,500. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",8500.0,Bob,8,
