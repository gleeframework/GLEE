{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and open to discussion. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Room for compromise:**  I'm leaving myself room to negotiate down if necessary.

**Note:** I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my minimum value ($10,000) as possible.  However, I'm also aware that John is a viable backup option, which gives me some leverage in negotiations."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  $8,500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,800.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price point. $8,600 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for something a little higher. How about we split the difference and go with $8,700? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8700}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $8,700 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last offer: $8,500. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We are down to our last two rounds of negotiation, and I have already tried to meet Bob halfway multiple times.
* **Bob's final offer:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a price that meets my minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time remaining and the fact that Bob has reached his absolute limit, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product for $10,000.  This ensures I get a price that is both fair and meets my minimum requirements."
