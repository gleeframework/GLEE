"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is the best starting point.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $9,500 is still a decent profit for Alice, considering the product is worth $8,000 to her. 
* **Open for Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and potentially meeting in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $10,250 is a good price for Bob, as he's still saving $1,750 compared to buying from John.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the next offer and Bob might be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has shown willingness to compromise, and accepting her offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price."
