"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While I agree it's a great item, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little more than I'd like to spend.  Could you do $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
