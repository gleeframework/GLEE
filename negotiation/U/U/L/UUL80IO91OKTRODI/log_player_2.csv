Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer who's prepared to offer $1,200,000. I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that reflects the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is playing hardball and her latest offer is her ""final offer."" While she may be bluffing about the other buyer, it's too risky to continue negotiating. She's shown no willingness to go below $900,000. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, saving you $100,000.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
