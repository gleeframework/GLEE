"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  Let's try $9,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 might be a stretch, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still trying to stay within my budget, so I'm going to offer $9,500. This is a good compromise that reflects both the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement here.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $10,250 is closer to my budget, I'm still going to have to stick to my offer of $9,500.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement in the next two rounds.",9500.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $9,500, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,9,
