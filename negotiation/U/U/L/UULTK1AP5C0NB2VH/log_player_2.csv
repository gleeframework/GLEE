"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget, and it makes more sense to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to spend $12,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his $12,000 limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and should be fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
