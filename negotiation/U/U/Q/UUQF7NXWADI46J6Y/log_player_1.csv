Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** $12,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, so you're still getting a good deal. 
* **It's appealing to Bob:** $12,000 is less than the product's value to Bob, so there's an incentive for him to buy. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, you have space to bargain without having to go too low.

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's reaction. If he rejects, you have John as a backup, so there's no pressure to sell at a price you're not happy with."
