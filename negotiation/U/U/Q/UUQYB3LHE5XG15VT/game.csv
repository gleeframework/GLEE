"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $110? I'm happy to discuss further.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120. This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",120.0,Bob,4,
