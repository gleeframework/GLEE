Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
