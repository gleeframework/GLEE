"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1800000. I'm open to negotiations and willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value I believe this product holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our current positions. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $900000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1200000, which is the same price I offered earlier. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. However, if not, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
