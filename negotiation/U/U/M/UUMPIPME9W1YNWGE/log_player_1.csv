Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob engaged.  It's also above my minimum price of $8,000, which leaves room for me to compromise if necessary. I'm eager to see what Bob's response will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and below my minimum price of $8,000. I'm not willing to accept that low of a price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price and hopefully more appealing to Bob. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John if this deal doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum price of $8,000 that I'm willing to accept it. I don't want to risk losing out on this sale and having to sell to John for a lower price. It's better to get $7,000 than nothing at all."
