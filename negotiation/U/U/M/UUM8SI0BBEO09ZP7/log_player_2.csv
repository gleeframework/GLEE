"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob's goal is to save as much as possible, so he's offering a price closer to his maximum budget of $120.
* **Reasonable Counter:**  $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation,  It's a significant discount from Alice's original offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and keeps the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** $108 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $120,  achieving a significant saving compared to the initial offer.
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will get a better price.  Alice has already shown flexibility, and further counteroffers might risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time Constraint:** With 10 rounds, accepting a good offer early is a better strategy than risking too much negotiation."
