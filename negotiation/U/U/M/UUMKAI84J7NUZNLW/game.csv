"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in buying the product, but I can only go as high as $8500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell the product for $9250.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
