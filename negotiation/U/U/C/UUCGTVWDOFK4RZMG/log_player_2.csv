Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

{""product_price"": 110}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above your budget of $120.  You are close to your limit and the product is worth $120 to you, but still a better deal can be found. Keep negotiating with Alice.  You are only halfway through the rounds and there is still a chance to get a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}

If Alice rejects this offer, you can either counter with a slightly higher offer, or start considering buying from John."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $152 is getting closer to your limit, it's still above your target of $120.  You have only three rounds left, so you need to be strategic. You're already willing to pay $115, so there is some room for negotiation.  Continue trying to push for a lower price, and if Alice rejects, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

You're at your limit now, and there's no room to go lower.  This counteroffer is the final offer you are willing to make.  If Alice rejects, you'll buy from John.  This puts the pressure on Alice to accept, as you've made it clear you're not willing to go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $149 is still above your limit of $120.  You have only one round left, and Alice has shown she's not willing to go lower.  It's best to buy from John at $120 to ensure you get the product at a price you are comfortable with.  This also avoids the risk of Alice rejecting your final counteroffer in the last round."
