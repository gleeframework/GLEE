"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8200? It's the best I can do at this point.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8200 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8700. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",8700.0,Alice,5,
