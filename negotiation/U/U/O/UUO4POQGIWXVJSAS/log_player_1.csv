"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale at a price of $120. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation upwards from his offer.  I can get the same price from John without wasting further time."
