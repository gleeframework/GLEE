"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're willing to sell it to you for $100. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($80). This is a strong starting point for negotiation. Bob's message is polite and emphasizes that he is interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with your budget, we are willing to sell the product to you for $90. Please let us know if this revised price meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's preferred price, but there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely secure a better price by continuing the negotiation. It's worth risking another round to potentially save another $5."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $90 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $88.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but is getting closer to Alice's offer. He is offering a price that is still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price, but lower than her last offer. This shows that he is serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We've considered your offer and are willing to sell the product to you for $89. We believe this is a fair compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $1 more than Bob's last offer.  While it would be ideal to get it for $88, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation. It's also better than paying $120 to John."
