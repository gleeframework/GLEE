"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price than his initial valuation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my valuation, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if we can close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still holding out for a price closer to my value. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining a good position in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally want to get closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffer is very close to my valuation.  With limited rounds remaining, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price. I'll accept this offer."
