"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,750,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm happy to go to $1,400,000, which would be a good compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.  My final offer is $1,550,000.  This represents a significant reduction on my initial price and ensures a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
