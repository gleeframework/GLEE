Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value,  $1,300,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.
