Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire it."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Aim High, but Reasonable:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation ($925,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also significantly exceeds your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to accept without revealing your bottom line. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get a fantastic deal at $925,000.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit above your $800,000 guarantee.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $800,000."
