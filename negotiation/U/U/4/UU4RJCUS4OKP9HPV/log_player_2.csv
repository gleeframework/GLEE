"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price that's closer to my $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy:

* **Signals my budget:** It lets Alice know I'm serious about getting a lower price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** We have plenty of rounds to meet somewhere in the middle. 

It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice moved closer to my range, but I'm still able to get it for $12,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit more to see if I can get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you consider that price?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Progress:**  I acknowledged Alice's movement by saying $12,500 was ""closer.""
* **New Target:** I'm aiming for $11,000 now, which is a significant jump from my last offer, but still below my ideal price from John.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative (""Would you consider...?""), showing I'm still willing to find a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,500? This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $11,500 is a good compromise. It's only $500 more than John's price, and it saves me a potential $3,500 from Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push for a small difference might lead to impasse.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice might not budge much further. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the chance of having to settle for John's offer later."
