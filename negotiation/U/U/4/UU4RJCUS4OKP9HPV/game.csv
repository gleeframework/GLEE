"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low. How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Would you consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,500? This price is fair considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",11500.0,Alice,5,
