"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $750,000, but that's my limit.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  I'm trying to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial.  How about we split the difference again and land at $850,000?  This is a significant discount on my initial price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $775,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting close.  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  My final offer is $812,500. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",812500.0,Alice,7,
