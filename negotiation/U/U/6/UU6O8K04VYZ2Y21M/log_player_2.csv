Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting close.  I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be fair to the value of this product.  My final offer is $812,500. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000.  You've made it clear that you have a firm budget.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price than risk Alice not budging further."
