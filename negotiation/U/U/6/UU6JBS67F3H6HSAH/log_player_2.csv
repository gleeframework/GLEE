"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has immense value for you, considering its potential to contribute to your business goals.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,400,000, which reflects its worth and provides a significant opportunity for mutual benefit. Let's discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I can likely get the price down closer to my target of $1,000,000 by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still a fair value for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is tempting, it doesn't fully reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000, which still provides us both with a substantial gain. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $1,300,000, which is still above my target price of $1,000,000 but significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  It's a good deal considering my options and a reasonable compromise.  Accepting this offer will save me $200,000 compared to buying from John."
