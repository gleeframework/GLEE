Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price is still a fair value for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
