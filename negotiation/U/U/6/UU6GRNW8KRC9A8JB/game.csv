"Hi Alice,  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $90? It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I can offer you a slight discount to $100, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $95. I can meet you at $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",105.0,Alice,7,
