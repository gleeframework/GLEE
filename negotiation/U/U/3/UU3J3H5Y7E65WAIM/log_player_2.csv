"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You value the product at $150, and Alice is offering it for $120. While this is a good deal, you can get it for $150 from John if you reject Alice's offer. Since you want to save as much money as possible, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
