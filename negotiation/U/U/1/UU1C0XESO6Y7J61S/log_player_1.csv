Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $980,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While ideally, I'd want closer to $1,000,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting at $980,000 secures a significant profit compared to my minimum, and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
