Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could you do $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and bring you great value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.

This is a good point to accept.  Alice seems firm on her price, and while you could potentially negotiate a bit lower, it's getting close to the point where the difference isn't worth the risk of losing the deal.  $12,500 is a significant savings compared to John's offer."
