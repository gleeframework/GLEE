"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $8,250, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
