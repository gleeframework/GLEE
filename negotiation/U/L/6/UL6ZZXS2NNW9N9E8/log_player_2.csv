Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  You know John will sell the product for $10,000, which is your target price.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal now."
