Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, given its value to me.  I believe this price is fair, considering I'm willing to close the deal immediately. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I understand his perspective, $1,250,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not going to drop my price that dramatically."
