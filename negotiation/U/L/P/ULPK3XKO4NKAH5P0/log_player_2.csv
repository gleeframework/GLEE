# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a product that could significantly benefit you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable arrangement.

I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $1,250,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,325,000. This reflects my desire to reach a fair agreement while still acknowledging the product's true worth.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000.

Let's work together to find a solution that meets both our needs."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your position carefully.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I also value closing this deal swiftly. Let's settle this now - $1,275,000. This is my final offer, reflecting a compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer and still within your budget. Given the limited rounds remaining and the risk of having to buy from John at a much higher price, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. You are saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
