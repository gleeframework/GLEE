"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a compromise at $825000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, but I'm still a bit above your latest offer. Would you be willing to consider this price?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not quite there on the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $812500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'd like to try to get it down a bit further. I'm willing to meet you at $787500. Would you be willing to accept this price?",787500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer you $797500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",797500.0,Alice,7,
