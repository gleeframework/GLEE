Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the asset has potential, I think $1,800,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 to start negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this asset holds value for both of us. Let's find a middle ground. I can go up to $1,350,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested but trying to lowball. We're still significantly below our minimum and John's offer. Holding firm for now is the best strategy to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I feel we're getting closer. To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're coming down in smaller increments now, showing we're willing to negotiate but not desperate. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and push Bob to make a decision. 
* **Above Minimum:** We're still aiming for a price above our absolute minimum and John's offer, leaving room for potential further negotiation if Bob counters again."
