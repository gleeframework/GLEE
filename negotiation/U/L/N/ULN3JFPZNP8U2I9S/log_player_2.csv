"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value for the product. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be more comfortable around $80 for the product."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price close to Alice's known value for the product. This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves room for me to increase my offer gradually.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While my offer is significantly lower, I'm framing it as a genuine interest in the product while expressing budget limitations. 
* **Leaving Negotiation Room:** Alice is likely to counter, and this gives us space to find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $80 is too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $100 is still above my target price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $100 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $90. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 89
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise but staying firm on my goal of staying below $90.
* **Direct Approach:**  By stating my desired price range directly, I'm making it clear what it will take to close the deal.
* **Maintaining Politeness:** It's important to keep the negotiation amicable to improve the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $95.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $95 is a good compromise. It's slightly above my ideal price, but significantly lower than both Alice's initial offer and John's price.
* **Time Constraint:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. Continuing to push for a lower price might make Alice less willing to negotiate or cause me to miss out on the deal entirely. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I might be able to get the price down a little more, the potential savings are not worth the risk of losing the deal at this point."
