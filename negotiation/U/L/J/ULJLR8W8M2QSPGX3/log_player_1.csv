Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product higher.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counter-offer without me immediately feeling pressured to accept. 
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasizing the value to Bob  ($15,000) helps him see the potential benefit of the deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth accepting or making a counter-offer myself.
* If negotiations stall or I feel I'm not getting close to my target, I'll switch to John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  My minimum acceptable price is $12,000, so I'm not losing anything by rejecting Bob's offer. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob. There's still room for compromise, and I can likely get a higher price than his initial offer. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:**  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to John as my backup. 

**Next Steps:** 

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his $12,000 and my initial $14,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, as you value it at $15,000. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still getting a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $13,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone in my message helps keep the negotiation going smoothly. 

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Limited Negotiating Room:**  While I could counter-offer, I'm not confident I can get Bob to come up to my minimum.  
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price,  avoiding any further negotiation risks.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $12,000. It's the most reliable way to ensure I reach my minimum goal."
