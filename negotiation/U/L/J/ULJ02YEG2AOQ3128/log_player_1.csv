{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $13,000 is less than the value Bob places on the product, so he has incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still some wiggle room to go up or down in price depending on Bob's response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great deal for such a valuable product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget.  Could we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $11,500 is still a good profit and a lot better than selling to John for $10,000. It's time to close this deal!"
