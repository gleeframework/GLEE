"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you at $715000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $715,000, which is only $15,000 more than my ideal price of $700,000.  While I'd love to get it for my initial price, it's not worth risking the deal and potentially ending up buying from John for $1,200,000.  I'll accept this offer and save myself $485,000."
