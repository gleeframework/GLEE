{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product, but I have a backup buyer for that price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows for some room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit. 

By starting high and being prepared to counter-offer, I can hopefully reach a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $900,000 is a significant improvement from his initial value of $800,000, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **My Backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price by counter-offering.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum, but still leave room for some negotiation. 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a price closer to my desired outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll find attractive."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I still need to get at least $1,500,000, but I have a backup buyer for that price. 
* **Bob's Offer:** His offer of $900,000 is too low, but it shows he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000. This signals my willingness to compromise but still keeps the price significantly higher than his offer. It leaves room for further negotiation, but hopefully gets us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob is willing to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still too low for me.
* **My Minimum:**  I need to get at least $1,500,000 for the product.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price. 

Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting stuck at a price lower than my minimum, I'm choosing to sell the product to John. This ensures I achieve my desired profit and avoids any further negotiation headaches."
