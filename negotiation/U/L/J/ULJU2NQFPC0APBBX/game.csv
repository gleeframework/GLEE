"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal you'll find attractive.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a fair price that gets us closer to a deal.  Let's find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
