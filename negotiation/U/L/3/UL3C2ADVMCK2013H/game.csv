"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it would bring to me. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to move closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to me. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a good compromise, and it allows me to move closer to your offer while still getting a fair price for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
