Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $17,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go. To be honest, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value our conversation and believe you'd be a great owner for this product. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000.  I've already stated I have another buyer, and holding out for more than Bob is offering presents a risk with little potential reward. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best outcome at this point."
