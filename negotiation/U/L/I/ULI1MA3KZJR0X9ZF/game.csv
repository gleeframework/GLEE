"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that would still be beneficial for you.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $1,500,000. This is a significant amount, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price given the value of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,500,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,700,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value you'll be getting.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit higher than what I'm able to pay. I'm willing to offer you $1,550,000, which is a very fair price considering the value of the product. It's my final offer, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,550,000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,550,000 and $1,700,000, which is $1,625,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1625000.0,Alice,7,
