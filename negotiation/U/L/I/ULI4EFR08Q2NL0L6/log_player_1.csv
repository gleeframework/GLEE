"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also establishes a friendly tone and opens the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum threshold.  I want to test if he is truly willing to walk away from the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $10,250 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is just above my minimum threshold and very close to John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures I secure a sale above my minimum, and it's likely that further negotiation with Bob will not lead to a higher price."
