"Hey Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $120. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and your need to sell the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $140. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
