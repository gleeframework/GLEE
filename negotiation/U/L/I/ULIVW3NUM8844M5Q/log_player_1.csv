{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not selling below your $12,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has incentive to negotiate because he values the product higher.
* **It's not too aggressive:** This price is likely to be considered reasonable by Bob. 

If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind your minimum price and the possibility of selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your fairness. However, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is above your minimum price of $12,000 and it's a reasonable compromise considering his initial rejection. Accepting his offer maximizes your profit while still securing a sale."
