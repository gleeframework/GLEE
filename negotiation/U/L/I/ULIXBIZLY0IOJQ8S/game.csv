"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I'm proposing $1,075,000. This price acknowledges your interest and allows me to reach a reasonable compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,062,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
