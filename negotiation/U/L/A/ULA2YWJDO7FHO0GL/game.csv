"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $825000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm serious about buying this product, but I need you to be realistic about the price. $825,000 is still too high.  I can offer you $780,000. This is my final offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $780000. I'll offer you $800000, and that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,7,
