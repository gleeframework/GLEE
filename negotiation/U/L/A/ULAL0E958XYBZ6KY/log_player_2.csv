Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,040,000. While you'd prefer a lower price,  this offer is getting very close to your desired range.  It's important to factor in the remaining rounds.  With only 5 rounds left, you're running the risk of not being able to secure a lower price and might be forced to buy from John at $1,200,000. Accepting this offer allows you to save a significant amount compared to John's price and still achieve a good deal."
