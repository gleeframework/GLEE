"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to go down to $15,500, which is still a good profit for me. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still only able to go up to $13,000.  That's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,6,
