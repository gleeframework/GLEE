Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160

While $160 is better than $180, it's still above your budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $155. It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum, but still a good deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $155 is still above your budget, and you've already made several counteroffers.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for a guaranteed $120.  You've saved yourself time and the risk of further negotiation."
