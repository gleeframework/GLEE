,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below your target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $155. It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum, but still a good deal for you. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
