"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $19,000 is far too high, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $19,000 is far above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is what it's worth to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $19,000 is my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $16,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob.  He can get the product for $12,000 from John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $14,000. This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 14000}
