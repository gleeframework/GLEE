Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not at that price.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the product's potential, we're still quite far apart.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers? I'd be willing to go up to $1,450,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, potentially ending up with a lower offer, or having the deal fall through altogether.  Selling to John ensures we get our minimum acceptable price."
