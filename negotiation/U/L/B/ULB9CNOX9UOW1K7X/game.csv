"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product holds value for me, but not at that price.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. Let's find a middle ground -  I'm proposing $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I understand the product's potential, we're still quite far apart.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers? I'd be willing to go up to $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
