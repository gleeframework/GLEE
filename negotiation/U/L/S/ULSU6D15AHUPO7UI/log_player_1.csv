"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good starting point. I'm also aware that Bob values the product less than I do, so I'm prepared to negotiate.  We'll see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price that's closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I believe it's a fair price that both of us could be happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a bit higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, hoping to either get closer to my desired price or accept John's offer for a guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is a significant step closer to my minimum price and hopefully enticing enough for Bob to consider.  If he rejects, I'm ready to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000.  The negotiation with Bob isn't progressing as quickly as I'd hoped.  John's offer is guaranteed and meets my minimum threshold, so it's the best option at this point."
