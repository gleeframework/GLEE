"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $80 is a fair price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to go up to $85, which is still a good compromise. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
