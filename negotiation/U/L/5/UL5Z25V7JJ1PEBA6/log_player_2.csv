"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to consider this product if you're willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're still a bit above your target price of $100.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate Alice down further before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. How about we split the difference and go with $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $108, which is as low as I'm comfortable going. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still a bit above your target price, but you're close. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm very close to my budget limit.  Would you be willing to come down to $103?  That would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 103}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $106, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $106
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer is still $6 more than you're willing to pay.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely she'll go any lower.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
