"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to consider this product if you're willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight. How about we split the difference and go with $105? ",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $108, which is as low as I'm comfortable going. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm very close to my budget limit.  Would you be willing to come down to $103?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",103.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $106, which is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",106.0,Alice,7,
