"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but  I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could you consider $17,000? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
