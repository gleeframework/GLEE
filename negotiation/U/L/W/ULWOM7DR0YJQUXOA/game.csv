"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $120 right now. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $155?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",135.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $135, but I'm willing to meet you at $145. I'm trying to make a profit here, after all!",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $145 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is my final offer.",140.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $150, that's my minimum. I'm starting to think I should just sell it to John at the higher price...",150.0,Alice,7,
