Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,200,000 is not my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  It's a good deal, and there's a risk of the price going back up if I reject the offer."
