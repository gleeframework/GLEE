"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit too steep for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000.  This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your desire to get a good price, $1,450,000 is still above my budget. Let's try to find a more agreeable middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant offer, and I hope we can reach a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
