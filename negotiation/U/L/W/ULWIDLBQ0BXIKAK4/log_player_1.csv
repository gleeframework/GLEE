"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and my minimum allows room for negotiation. This initial offer acts as an anchor.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""potential"" and ""return on investment"" attempts to frame the price in a positive light, even though it's above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I need to be mindful that I have a guaranteed offer from John.  This initial offer leaves a considerable gap for negotiation before I'm even close to considering John's deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit too steep for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his own perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject this offer to signal that I'm looking for a higher price point and proceed to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000.  This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial step down from $1,600,000 to $1,450,000. This shows Bob I'm flexible but still aiming for a price significantly above his initial offer.
* **Justification:** I'm reinforcing the product's ""unique benefits"" to keep Bob focused on its value beyond a simple market comparison.
* **Maintaining a Buffer:**  This counter-offer keeps me well above both Bob's perceived value and my absolute minimum, allowing room for further negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand your desire to get a good price, $1,450,000 is still above my budget. Let's try to find a more agreeable middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant offer, and I hope we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above my guaranteed sale price from John. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the difference is now relatively small. Accepting this offer secures a strong profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or negotiations stalling."
