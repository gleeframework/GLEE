{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I'm confident it's worth even more to you.  My initial offer is $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point, especially since I have more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a great deal for you considering the value of this product, and it's still a good price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. That's the most I can afford for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is offering, I'm going to accept it. It's a good deal considering the time and effort involved in negotiating, and I can close the deal now."
