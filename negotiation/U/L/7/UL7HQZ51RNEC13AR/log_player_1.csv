{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  This leaves room for you to make concessions if necessary. 

By starting with this offer, you can see if Bob is willing to pay closer to your desired price point. If he rejects, you can then gauge his interest and counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about $108? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.

While $108 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him just a little bit higher."
