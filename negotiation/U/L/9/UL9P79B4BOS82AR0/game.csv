"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $12,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a slightly higher price. How does $12,500 sound to you?  I know it's a bit more than you initially envisioned, but I believe the value it provides will be worth it. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
