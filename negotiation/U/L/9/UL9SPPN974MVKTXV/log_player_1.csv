Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is intentionally above Bob's perceived value. This aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest level. 
    * Establish the product's high value in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" signaling  willingness to negotiate.

**Important:**  While you have John as a backup, keep in mind that Bob is willing to pay more than your minimum acceptable price. The goal is to maximize profit, not just secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase [product name], but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value of $1,200,000, indicating he's very interested.  It's still below your minimum ($1,500,000) and your backup offer from John. There's room to negotiate further and potentially close a deal closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1650000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This common negotiation tactic aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The offer keeps the price well above your $1,500,000 minimum and John's standing offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""product's true value,"" you subtly re-emphasize its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000. I hope this offers a compromise that respects both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even better than John's offer. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might walk away. This offer represents a strong profit, and it's wise to secure the deal now."
