"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase [product name], but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
