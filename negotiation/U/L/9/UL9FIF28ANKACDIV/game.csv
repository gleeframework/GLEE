"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go over $12,000.  It's my absolute maximum.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",13500.0,Alice,5,
