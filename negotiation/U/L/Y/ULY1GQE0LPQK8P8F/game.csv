"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $10,000 right now.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, however, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair, I can come down to $17,000. This is a very competitive offer.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $17,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. Could we possibly settle around $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to make a final offer at $14,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's more than fair for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
