I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's justified.  

Here's why:

* **It sets a strong baseline.** By offering a high price, I signal the value I place on the product and establish a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **It leaves room for compromise.**  If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down while still potentially getting a significant profit.
* **It maximizes my potential earnings.**  If Bob is willing to pay a high price, I want to capture that value.

However, I'm also aware of the risks:

* **Bob might reject outright.**  He might find my offer unreasonable.
* **It could lead to a lengthy negotiation.** Bob might counter with a much lower price, requiring multiple rounds of negotiation.

I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation. I'm also aware of my fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000, which I will consider if the negotiation with Bob becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's not worth selling the product for that price. I'm willing to risk further negotiation and potentially reach a better deal with Bob. 

I'm also considering the potential to increase the offer from John if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Compromise and Signal:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. It signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but also that I won't be pressured into accepting a price that undervalues my product.
* **Middle Ground:**  $1,200,000 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable compromise that could be acceptable to both parties. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I still have room to negotiate downwards.  I can make a final counteroffer around $1,100,000 before considering selling to John.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be accepted, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary. I'm also keeping a close eye on my fallback option with John and will adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. 

Here's why:

* **Close to my minimum:** $900,000 is only $100,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a significant difference, and I believe I can still do better.
* **John's offer:** John is willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a safer and more secure option.
* **Risk of losing momentum:** If I accept Bob's offer, I risk losing any potential to get closer to my desired price in future rounds. 

I'm going to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price close to $1,000,000, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer to Bob at $1,050,000. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Close to my minimum:** This price is only $50,000 above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Significant Compromise:** This offer demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise further, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.
* **Finality:** I'm treating this as my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'll proceed with selling the product to John for $1,000,000.

I believe this offer is a fair compromise that should be acceptable to Bob, especially given the potential loss of the deal."
