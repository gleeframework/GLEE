"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,100,000 is still above his maximum budget of $800,000. There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is far greater.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,025,000 is still too high, even though it's closer to his budget. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if they can meet in the middle."

Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $987,500. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?

Bob should buy from John. While Alice is getting closer to his price range, $987,500 is still above his budget.  Since John is willing to sell for $800,000, it's a much better deal for Bob."
