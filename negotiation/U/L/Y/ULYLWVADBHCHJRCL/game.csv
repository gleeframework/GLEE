"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've outlined.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $850,000 is a significant investment, the true value of this product is far greater.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
