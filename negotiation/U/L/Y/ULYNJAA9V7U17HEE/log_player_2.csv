I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, hoping to get her attention and start a negotiation. I'm leaving some room to negotiate further, but this is a good starting point."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying but still trying to stay within my budget. This counteroffer is a good compromise, and hopefully, Alice will accept."

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000, but not a penny more. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
