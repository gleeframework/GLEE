Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product for $7,600. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?

Alice is very close to your $8,000 walk-away point.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might annoy her, and she's unlikely to go much lower. Taking the $7,600 offer saves you money and ends the negotiation."
