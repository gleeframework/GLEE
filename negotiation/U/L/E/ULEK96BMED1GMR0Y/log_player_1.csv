Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by offering Bob a price that's slightly higher than what I'm willing to accept, but still lower than what I think the product is worth to him. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $90}

This is a reasonable price that's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay, and it gives me some room to negotiate if he tries to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer is lower than what I initially asked for, but it's still a decent price. Since I'm willing to sell the product for at least $80, I'll consider accepting his offer. However, I'll also think about the potential profit I could make if I negotiate further or sell it to John.

For now, I'll choose to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial price. This should give me some room to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my target price.

{""product_price"": $87}

This counteroffer is a compromise that's still reasonable for Bob, but also gives me a bit more wiggle room to negotiate. Let's see how Bob responds!"
