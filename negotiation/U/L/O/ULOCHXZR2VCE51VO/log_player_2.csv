Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $8,000 from John. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as he might be able to get a better price."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's latest offer of $11,000 is still too high for Bob, and he's already reached his limit for counteroffers.  John offers a much better deal, and Bob should take it to save money."
