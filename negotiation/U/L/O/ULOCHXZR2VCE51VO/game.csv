"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a fair price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm really interested in getting this product from you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not sure that's enough for me to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $11,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
