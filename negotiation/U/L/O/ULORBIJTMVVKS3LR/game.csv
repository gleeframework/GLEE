"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1200000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to move forward with the transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. Can we try $1275000?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. While I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price, $1275000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value you'll receive from this product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $1300000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1290000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it a fair deal.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $1290000 simply doesn't cover my costs. Let's meet in the middle at $1295000. It's a small step up from your offer and a fair price for the value of this product. I'm confident you'll see the benefit of this investment.",1295000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $1290000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please reconsider and see if we can find a way to make this work.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
