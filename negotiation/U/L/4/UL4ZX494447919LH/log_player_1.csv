"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiation to see if I can secure a better price.  If Bob rejects, we can then start to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is still a good price, I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price of $8,000.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway from my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $8,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept this price and sell the product to Bob.  If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same price."
