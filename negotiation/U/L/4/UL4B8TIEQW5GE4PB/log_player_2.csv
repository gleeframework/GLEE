"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price considering your own valuation.  Let me know your decision, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings who is willing to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
