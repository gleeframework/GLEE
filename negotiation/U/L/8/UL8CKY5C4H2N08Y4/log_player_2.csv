Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Explanation: While Alice is coming closer to my budget, it's still more expensive than John's offer. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and I'm happy to buy from John for $8,000."
