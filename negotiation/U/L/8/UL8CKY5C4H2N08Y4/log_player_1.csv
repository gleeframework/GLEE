Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you're not giving it away for less than you're willing to accept. 

This strategy allows for negotiation and potential for a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle on $6,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell it for that low, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $8,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $8,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
