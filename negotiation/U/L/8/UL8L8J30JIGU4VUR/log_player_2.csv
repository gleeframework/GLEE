Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product at this price.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,200.  Since John offers the product for $8,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price from John."
