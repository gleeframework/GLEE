"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to make a more competitive purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate the offer. While it's tempting,  I can't accept $1,400,000 at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000,  which still reflects the value I place on this product.  Let's continue this dialogue and see if we can find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
