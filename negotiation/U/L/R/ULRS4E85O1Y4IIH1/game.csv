"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my bottom line.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
