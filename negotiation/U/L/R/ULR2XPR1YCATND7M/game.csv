"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is higher than I'm willing to go. Given my research and the product's value, I'm prepared to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a higher price point. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
