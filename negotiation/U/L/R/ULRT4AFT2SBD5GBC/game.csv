"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $14,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product for $13,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
