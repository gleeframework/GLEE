Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now offering the product for $13,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is only $1,000 more than John's offer.  

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has a risk. Alice might not budge from $13,000, and we'd end up taking John's offer anyway.  
* **Time:** We've already used 5 rounds. While we have more rounds, a deal now guarantees we get the product.

It's a good strategy to accept a reasonable offer rather than pushing for the absolute lowest price and potentially missing out."
