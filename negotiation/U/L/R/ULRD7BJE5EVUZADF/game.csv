"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is significantly lower. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
