Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The goal is to find a price that is agreeable to both of you while maximizing your profit."
