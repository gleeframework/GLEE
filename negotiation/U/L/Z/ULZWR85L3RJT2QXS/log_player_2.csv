"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than $100 to you. Considering this, I propose to sell it to you for $120. This price reflects not only its market value but also the opportunity cost for both of us. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is above your maximum budget of $100. You know you can get the product for $100 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door to getting a better price, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by going with John."
