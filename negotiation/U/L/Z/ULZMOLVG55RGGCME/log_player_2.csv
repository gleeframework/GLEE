"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm open to offers, but I know it's worth at least $150 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $175 is way above your maximum budget of $100.  It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $100. You have a chance to negotiate further, so it's worth rejecting and seeing if you can get the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is tempting, it's still above your budget.  It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to your goal of $100. If Alice won't budge further, you can always go with John's offer."
