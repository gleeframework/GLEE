"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $100 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $130? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get it for $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120?  That's a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $120 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm very serious about buying this product, but I'm sticking to my offer of $110.  It's the most I can pay right now.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",110.0,Bob,6,
