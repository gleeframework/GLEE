"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $150 by both parties. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. Would you like to proceed with the purchase at this special offer price of $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are looking to save money, and Alice is offering the product at your maximum price. You can get the same product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open. You can then potentially negotiate with Alice or John to try and get a lower price."
