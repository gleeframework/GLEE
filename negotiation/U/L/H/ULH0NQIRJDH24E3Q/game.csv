"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product but would be willing to pay $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That would be fair for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there with $95. How about $100? That would be a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
