"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is above Bob's perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and conversational tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly hinting at the product's value by saying it's ""a great fit"" for Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and respectful."
