"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be a perfect fit for you! I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $115?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you're interested and $115 is closer to what I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $125? That gives us both a good deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $120, which is my absolute maximum.  This would be a win-win, as it's your asking price and within my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
