Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being positive and emphasizing the value proposition for Bob. This helps build rapport and encourages him to consider the offer.

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my profits, but I also want to avoid a lengthy negotiation.
* A price of $12,000 gives me a good starting point for negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I won't go below $11,000 to ensure I'm getting a fair deal.
* I have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000, so I can be firm in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $11,000. I'm not willing to settle for a loss, and selling to John would be much more profitable.

**Reasoning:**

* I have a solid alternative buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.
* Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my leverage and potentially negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't accept $10,000.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to the value I need. Let's see if we can agree on this,  I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000, which is my absolute minimum acceptable price. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below my actual value of $15,000.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but emphasizing that it's too low. I'm also expressing a willingness to compromise and negotiate further. 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm trying to find a price that satisfies both of us. 
* I'm not giving away too much but also demonstrating flexibility to reach a deal.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000, as I know I can get a better price elsewhere."
