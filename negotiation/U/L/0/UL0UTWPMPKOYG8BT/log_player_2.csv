{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to try and get a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point.  $725,000 is a good deal, saving me $75,000 compared to buying from John. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high, especially since the product's value to me is $800,000."
