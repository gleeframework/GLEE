Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm not willing to go above $97.50. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. I'm not willing to pay more than $97.50 for the product.

Bob is firm at $97.50 and unwilling to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a better offer from him. Accepting his offer is a loss compared to John's guaranteed $100.  It's time to move on to John."
