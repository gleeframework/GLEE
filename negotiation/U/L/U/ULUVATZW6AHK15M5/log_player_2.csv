# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my range. My absolute maximum is $15,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value we both agree on. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $16,000 is still above my maximum budget of $15,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy from John at my target price.  

Therefore, I will choose to buy the product from John for $15,000."
