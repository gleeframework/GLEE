{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $125?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I can still get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great deal for you and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135. I'm still looking to spend a little less. How about $130?  I think this is a fair compromise and gets us both closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $130 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum value of $150 and it avoids the risk of Bob rejecting further offers or me having to sell to John for $150."
