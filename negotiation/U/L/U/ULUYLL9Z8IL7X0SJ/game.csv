"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has great potential. However, I think your starting price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. Would that be possible?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,080,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
