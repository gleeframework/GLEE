Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm looking to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, I'm ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his willingness to pay.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
