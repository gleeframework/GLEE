"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice.  While John offers a good deal, there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down closer to our $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge her flexibility. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is framed politely and explains our budgetary constraints, making us appear reasonable and serious buyers. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give us valuable information about Alice's bottom line and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Our Limit:** Alice has met our target price of $10,000. 
* **No Benefit to Delay:** We could try to negotiate further, but there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. Waiting carries the risk of her offer expiring or finding another buyer.
* **John's Offer is the Same:** Buying from John would also cost $10,000.  There's no advantage to switching at this point.

Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at our desired price."
