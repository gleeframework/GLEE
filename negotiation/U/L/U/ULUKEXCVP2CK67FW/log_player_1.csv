"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000, it's too far below my minimum. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer the product for $10,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
