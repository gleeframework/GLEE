Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth that much in my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're trying to find a compromise, but the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I can see this product being worth $900,000 to me, but I can't justify going any higher than that.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but at a very slow pace. He's still far below the product's value to you, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's $1,500,000 offer within the remaining rounds. Cutting your losses and selling to John guarantees you a strong profit."
