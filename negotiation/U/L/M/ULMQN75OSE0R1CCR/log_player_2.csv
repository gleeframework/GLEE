"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to explore lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a bold counteroffer, aiming to save a significant amount of money.  $1,000,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, and while it's likely Alice will reject this, it sets the stage for a negotiation that favors Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob is still aiming to save more. Rejecting the offer gives him another opportunity to try and push for a lower price. He can counteroffer with a price closer to his target of $1,000,000, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,050,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but recognizing that he needs to make a more realistic counteroffer.  $1,050,000 is a compromise between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer.  This shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is now very close to Bob's target of $1,000,000.  At this point, further negotiation is likely to be difficult and time-consuming.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal while still saving Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  There's a chance Bob might be able to get a better deal in the next few rounds, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or not reaching a compromise is too high."
