"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This is a tactic to set the stage for a negotiation and establish my desired value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's far below my minimum acceptable value. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob or, in the worst-case scenario, sell to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good deal and ensures a quick sale. It's important to note that even though I could sell to John for $1,000,000, there's no guarantee that John will be available in the future.  I'm not willing to risk missing out on this sale to wait for a potential future offer."
