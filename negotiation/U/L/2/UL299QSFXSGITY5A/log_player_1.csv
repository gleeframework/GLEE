I'm starting with a price of $175. It's a bit higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to $155. It's still a bit higher than Bob's offer but I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm not sure if we'll be able to agree on a price. Selling to John for $150 guarantees I'll get my minimum price."
