"Alice, that's a very high price. While I see the value in your product, I'm only willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to move on.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're still not willing to meet me in the middle, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,5,
