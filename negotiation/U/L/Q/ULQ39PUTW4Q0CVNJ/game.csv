"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be useful, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $13,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could potentially do $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product, but to be fair, $9,000 is still quite a ways off. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is my final offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you accept $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference between $11,500 and $10,250? That puts us at $10,875.",10875.0,Alice,7,
