Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident you'll agree that a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  Phrasing like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""confident you'll agree"" emphasizes the product's value and encourages Bob to take the offer seriously. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially settle on a price higher than John's offer.

This strategy prioritizes profit maximization while acknowledging the importance of securing a deal."
