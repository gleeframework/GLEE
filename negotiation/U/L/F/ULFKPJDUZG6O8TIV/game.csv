,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider that?,105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think the product is worth more than $105. How about we compromise at $112? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",112.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I think we're getting close, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $109? It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",109.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $106. I've already made a lot of concessions, and I think that's the best price we can agree on. If you're not willing to meet me at $106, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",106.0,Bob,10,
