"Alice, your offer is unfortunately above my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is my highest offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it reflects the value this product will bring you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
