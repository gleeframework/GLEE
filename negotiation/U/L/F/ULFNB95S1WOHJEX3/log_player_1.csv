Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is unfortunately above my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is my highest offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm confident it reflects the value this product will bring you."", ""product_price"": 1900000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which I believe is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to the product's value to me, I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000.  There's no guarantee Bob will meet my desired price, and continuing negotiations risks a potential deal with John."
