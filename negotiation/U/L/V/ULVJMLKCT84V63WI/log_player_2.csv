You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. Since the product is worth $120 to you, you are indifferent between buying from Alice and John.  However, rejecting Alice's offer keeps the possibility open for a counteroffer from Alice in the future."
