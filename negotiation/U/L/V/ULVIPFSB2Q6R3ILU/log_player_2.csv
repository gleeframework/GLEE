"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $12000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12500.  Let me know what you think! If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is $12,500, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While Alice is trying to sell the product to Bob, Bob can get the same product from John for $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob."
