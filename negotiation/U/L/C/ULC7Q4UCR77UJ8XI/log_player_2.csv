# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're offering it to you at an exclusive price of $120. This is a special opportunity tailored just for you, considering its significant worth to you at $150. We hope you'll find this offer appealing and look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $120 is less than $150.
* **The product is still worth more to Bob than to Alice:**  Bob values the product at $150, and Alice values it at $80, so Bob is getting a good deal even at $120."
