Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I do recognize your strong interest in the product. Let's try to find a solution. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest I can go while still honoring the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has stated that $1,500,000 is her final offer. She's working with a clear valuation in mind.
* **You have a guaranteed alternative:**  John offers the product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget. There's no risk of ending up with nothing. 
* **Saving $500,000 is significant:** While the product might have potential, saving such a large amount is a strong incentive to go with John's offer."
