"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has potential, the asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for further discussion.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident you'll see a substantial return on this investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to my range, but $1,800,000 is still a significant investment. To be frank, I have a budget in mind, and to make this work, I'd be willing to go as high as $950,000.  Let me know if that's something you can consider.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I do recognize your strong interest in the product. Let's try to find a solution. Would you be willing to consider $1,500,000?  This is my final offer, as it represents the lowest I can go while still honoring the value of this product.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
