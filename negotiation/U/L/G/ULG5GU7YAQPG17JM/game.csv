"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $85. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $90 is still a little out of my range.  Let's split the difference - I'll pay $87.50. It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
