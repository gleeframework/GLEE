"Bob, I'm offering you the chance to acquire this product for a price that's significantly less than its value to you.  It's a unique opportunity for you to gain a substantial competitive edge.  My price is $1,200,000, which represents a fair deal for both of us.  Consider the potential return on investment this product will provide, and let me know your decision.  If you decline, I'll be moving forward with another interested party.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
