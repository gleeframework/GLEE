Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) is key to maximizing profit.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and presents the offer as a ""fair deal.""  This positive framing can make Bob more receptive."
