"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a deal above your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial high price will help gauge Bob's seriousness and how much he values the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell below that price.

This first offer allows us to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. My counteroffer is $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher amount. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize your budget constraints, the product's value remains substantial.  Let's find a compromise - how about we settle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're moving closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  We're not simply agreeing to a lower price; we're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Urgency:** We have limited rounds, so pushing for a quicker resolution is advantageous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,600,000 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time Value:**  We are over halfway through our negotiation rounds. While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round. 
* **Bird in Hand:** Securing a good deal now is generally better than risking it for a potentially slightly better deal later, especially given that we have a guaranteed offer from John."
