{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You're getting the product for $108, which is within your budget and significantly cheaper than buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of reaching a deal with Alice is becoming more uncertain."
