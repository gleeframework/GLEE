Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is offering my minimum price, but I've already had a chance to see that he's willing to negotiate. I'm confident that I could get a better price from him if I keep pushing, but I'm also running out of time. I don't want to risk losing this deal completely.  It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John."
