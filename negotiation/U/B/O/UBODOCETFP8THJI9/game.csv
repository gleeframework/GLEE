"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $85? It's a good price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than $95. How about $105? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value.",105.0,Alice,5,
