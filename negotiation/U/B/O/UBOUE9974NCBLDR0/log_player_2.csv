"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or stick with your backup plan of buying from John."
