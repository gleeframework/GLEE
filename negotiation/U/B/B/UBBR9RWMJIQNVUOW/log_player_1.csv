Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room to negotiate above that.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and sets a strong anchor point.  
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate downwards. However, I have the security of John's offer at $10,000, ensuring I don't make a loss."
