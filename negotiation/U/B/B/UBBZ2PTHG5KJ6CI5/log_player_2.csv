"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is far too high. It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's more in line with his maximum value. This counteroffer allows for negotiation and potentially a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  It's more strategic for Bob to continue negotiating, as he still has room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

Bob is getting closer to his maximum value. This counteroffer shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product, but he's also not willing to go significantly above his limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  Even though it's getting closer to Bob's maximum value, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob has 5 rounds left, and he should continue to try to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is now at his maximum value, so he's making his final counteroffer. He's hoping that Alice will accept, as it's unlikely she'll be able to get a better price from another buyer.  If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value, and he only has three rounds left. It's not worth continuing to negotiate, especially with the risk of Alice making even higher counteroffers in the future. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $12,000 and guarantee the purchase within his budget."
