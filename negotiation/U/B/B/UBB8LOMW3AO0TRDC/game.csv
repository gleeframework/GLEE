"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
