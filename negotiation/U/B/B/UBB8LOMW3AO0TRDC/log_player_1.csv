Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you consider $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?  That would be a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
