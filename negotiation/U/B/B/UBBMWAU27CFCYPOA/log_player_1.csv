Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? I believe that's a fair price that still gives you a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a great deal, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your original offer. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,000?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.
