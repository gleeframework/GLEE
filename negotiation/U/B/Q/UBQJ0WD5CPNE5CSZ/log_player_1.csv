"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $200 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($200) as a negotiation tactic. This gives me room to lower the price if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a positive tone to make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end the message by inviting Bob to discuss the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $100 for it right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a justification:** I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, providing a reason why I'm choosing this price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the conversation friendly and showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on the value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $175, but I'm still a little high. I'm willing to go up to $150.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:** There's little to no room for further negotiation, as a higher price would not be beneficial for me.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer might risk losing him as a buyer, and I'm not guaranteed a better offer in future rounds. 
* **Selling to John is the same price:** While selling to John would also net me $150, accepting Bob's offer provides an opportunity to potentially build a relationship and potentially do business with him in the future."
