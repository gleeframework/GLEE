"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I could consider, this product truly offers exceptional value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? That's the absolute maximum I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,
