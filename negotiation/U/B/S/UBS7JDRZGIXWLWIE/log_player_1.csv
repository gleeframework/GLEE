Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
