Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $1,600,000? It's a compromise that should work for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair deal.
