This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable value.  It gives you room to negotiate down while still securing a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial asking price. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
