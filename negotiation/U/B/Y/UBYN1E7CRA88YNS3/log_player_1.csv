Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value,"" Alice subtly implies that the price is justified without explicitly stating why Bob should value it at that higher price.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating she'll list it publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. While John is a backup, Bob doesn't know that. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on Alice's knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and risk tolerance, she might adjust her strategy."
