"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,150,000 is still a little high for my budget. I could do $1,050,000. Would that work for you?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,100,000, but I'm also willing to give you a slight concession to $1,080,000. This is my final offer on that price point.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
