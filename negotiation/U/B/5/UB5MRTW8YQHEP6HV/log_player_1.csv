I'll reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 
I'm going to stick with my initial asking price of $1,000,000. It's a fair price for a product worth that much to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob has come up to $950,000. That's pretty close to my target price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's time to take the deal and secure the profit."
