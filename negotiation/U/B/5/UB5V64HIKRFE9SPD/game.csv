"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This gives you a fair price and me a decent return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $8,000. How about $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,500, which is a significant compromise on my part. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but $9,500 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,250, but no more. This is my final offer.",8250.0,Bob,6,
