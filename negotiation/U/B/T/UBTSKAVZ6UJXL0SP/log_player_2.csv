"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's in Bob's best interest to try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down, and even if she doesn't, Bob can still get the product for his target price by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target. Bob should continue negotiating and try to get a better price. If he rejects this offer, he can continue to make counteroffers or even choose to buy from John if he feels the negotiation isn't going his way.  There's still room for improvement and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $1,075,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, but it's still above it. Bob should continue negotiating, as there is still room to improve the price. He can either counteroffer again with a price closer to $1,075,000 or continue to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to come down further. He should keep in mind the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 as a backup plan if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a satisfactory outcome."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a price a little lower. How about we settle at $1,070,000? This would be a great compromise for both of us. I'm confident that this product is worth it to you at this price, and it's well within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1070000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer and is not willing to go lower. While the price of $1,080,000 is getting close to Bob's target, it's still a bit higher. Bob has already gone through several rounds of negotiations and has reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are minimal. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed deal that aligns with Bob's budget and saves him $80,000 compared to Alice's final offer."
