```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal, but I'm also trying to be realistic.

```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd still prefer a lower price, it's getting closer to my target, and I'm concerned about running out of rounds. There's also a chance that Alice might not budge further. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price that's better than what John is offering, leaving me more money for future purchases."
