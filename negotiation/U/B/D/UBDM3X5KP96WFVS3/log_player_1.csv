Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying and how much value he places on the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll have a better idea of his range and can adjust my counteroffer accordingly.  I also know that I have John as a backup, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him for $800,000. There's no point in haggling further, especially since I know John will pay me the same amount."
