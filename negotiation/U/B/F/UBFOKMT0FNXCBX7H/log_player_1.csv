Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $950,000 is a good outcome considering the limited rounds and the alternative of selling to John for $800,000."
