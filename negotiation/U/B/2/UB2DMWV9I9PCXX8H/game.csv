"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This reflects the value it holds for me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
