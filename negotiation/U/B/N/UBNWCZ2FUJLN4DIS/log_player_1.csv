Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $950,000. Here's why:

* **My minimum:** I know I can get at least $800,000 from John, so I need to offer Bob a price higher than that. 
* **Bob's value:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. By offering $950,000, I'm giving him a significant discount, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maximizing profit:** This price allows me to earn significantly more than my minimum, while still being attractive to Bob. 

This strategy balances my need for a good profit with the desire to incentivize Bob to accept the offer."
