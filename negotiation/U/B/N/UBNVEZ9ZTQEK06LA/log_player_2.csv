Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While your product is good, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we agree on $925,000?"", ""product_price"": 925000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
 

While we could likely negotiate a little lower, accepting at $975,000 is a good deal. It falls well within our budget and represents a significant savings compared to John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain isn't worth the risk of Alice backing out."
