"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While your product is good, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we agree on $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $925,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",975000.0,Alice,5,
