Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its unique value and your potential gain, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're essentially playing with a safety net. This allows you to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Perceived Value:** The wording emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,800,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. Even if he manages to bring the price down significantly, you're still likely to end up with a profit margin far greater than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If he knew, your negotiating position would be significantly weakened."
