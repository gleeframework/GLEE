{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it's not too far off. This gives us some room to negotiate while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $140 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and while we want to make a sale, we're not willing to sell for less than $150. It's worth seeing if we can get closer to our desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer, but unfortunately, $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160, as this product is truly worth it. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $145 for it, can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum desired price of $150. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to compromise further. Selling to John for $150 guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
