"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find anything better on the market. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $15000 was a bit high.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11000? It's a fair price that's a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $9500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $9500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you be willing to go up to $10500?  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $9750. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
