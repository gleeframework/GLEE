"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for this product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer, as it's right at my minimum price and I'm hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $8750. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a deal without either of us feeling like we've made a huge concession. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $8750. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it benefits both of us.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $8,750 is tempting, I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a little more in the remaining rounds. If nothing else, I have the option to sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $8,875.  This would be a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8875 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $8750. This would be a good compromise, and I think it would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd love to get more from Bob, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and he's not budging.  Selling to John guarantees me a solid profit, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price or running out of time."
