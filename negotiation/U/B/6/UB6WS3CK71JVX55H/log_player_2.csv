Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $950,000 is already a very competitive offer. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This offer represents a balance between its true worth and a fair deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  I've tried to be flexible, but $875,000 is cutting it a little too close to my bottom line.
