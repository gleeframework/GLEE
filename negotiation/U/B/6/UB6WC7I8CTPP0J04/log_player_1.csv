"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $9,000. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as much as possible.  I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we aim for $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is still a good price, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired $8,000 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than $7,500.  Let's compromise at $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired $8,000, but I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal.  $8,500 is a good compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I would like to suggest a price closer to my budget. Would $8,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a great deal! Bob has offered my minimum desired price, and I'm happy to close the deal. There's no point in risking a further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer or wasting more rounds."
