"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000. This still represents a significant discount from my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider this middle ground?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $950,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
