"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
