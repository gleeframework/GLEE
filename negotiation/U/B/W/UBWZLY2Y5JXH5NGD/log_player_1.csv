Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the value in.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000, but she also has a guaranteed sale at that price. Starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product might be worth even more than Bob's valuation, creating a sense of potential gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is not demanding but invites Bob to discuss. This keeps the door open for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price above $800,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round offer. In a real negotiation, more back-and-forth would occur, allowing Alice to adjust her strategy based on Bob's responses."
