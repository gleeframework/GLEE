"Alice,  $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget for this product. I'm willing to pay $500000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $500000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  I understand budget constraints, but this product has real potential.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1250000?  This would still give you a good deal while ensuring I receive a fair value for my product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $1250000 is still too high for me. While I see the potential in this product, I'm only comfortable going up to $700000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
