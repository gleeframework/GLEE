"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",15000.0,Alice,3,
