"Alice, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $10,500.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,800? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,800 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,600? It's a good compromise and allows us both to get what we want.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $10,900? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
