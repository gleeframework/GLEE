"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. It's always worth trying to save more money, especially when the potential savings are significant."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a deal for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, $1,100,000 is a good price considering the product's value to him.  It's a significant savings compared to buying from John, and further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even a worse outcome."
