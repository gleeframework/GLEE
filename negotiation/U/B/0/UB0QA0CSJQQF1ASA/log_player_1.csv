{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal.
* **Focus on value:** My message emphasizes the product's value and potential for Bob. This helps build interest and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, signaling that a counteroffer might be entertained. 

**Strategy:**

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I'm willing to give some ground, but ultimately I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,250,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my initial offer, it's not enough to justify selling the product at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  By rejecting the offer, I show Bob that I am serious about getting a fair price and I am willing to continue negotiating. This also allows me to potentially raise the price a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,200,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a firm stance:** While acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, I reiterate my need for a higher price.  This demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount.
* **Offer a compromise:**  I suggest a price of $1,200,000, which is a slight reduction from my initial offer but still well above Bob's current offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own value.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** The message emphasizes a desire to find a mutually beneficial solution, creating a more collaborative tone.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining leverage. I'm using a gradual approach, hoping to increase the price progressively until I reach a point closer to my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,200,000 is beyond my current budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I hope this might open up a path to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a slight improvement from his previous offer, it's not enough for me to consider selling the product at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer again. I will aim for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I will also consider how much further I am willing to negotiate. If Bob continues to reject my offers, I will be prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $1,150,000 is still too far off from what I need to make this deal work. I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us, so I'm willing to offer one final compromise.  If you can meet me at $1,175,000, I'm ready to finalize the sale.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** This message emphasizes that this is a final attempt to reach an agreement. It creates a sense of urgency and potentially motivates Bob to make a final decision.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  The offered price of $1,175,000 is a small increase from Bob's last offer and a significant decrease from my previous offer. This shows a willingness to be flexible while still maintaining some leverage.
* **Mutual Benefit:** The message again emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, aiming to appeal to Bob's desire for a good deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated risk. It's a significant compromise, but it's still above Bob's perceived value.  I'm hoping that by presenting it as a final offer, I can push Bob to accept.  If he rejects, I'm ready to sell to John and end the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my financial situation, I'm unable to meet the price of $1,175,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I hope this might help us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is the final round of negotiation with Bob. His offer of $1,150,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have already made significant compromises to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a satisfactory outcome for me.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000. While this is less than my ideal price, it is still a profitable transaction and guarantees I don't lose out on the value of the product. This decision demonstrates a willingness to walk away from a deal that doesn't meet my minimum expectations, preserving my financial interests."
