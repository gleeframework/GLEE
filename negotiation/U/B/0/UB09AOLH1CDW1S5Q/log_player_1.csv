Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both parties.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I believe this is a more reasonable price that still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges the potential risks and uncertainties.
