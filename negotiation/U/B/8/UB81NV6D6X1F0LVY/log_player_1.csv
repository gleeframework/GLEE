Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Motivating Bob:**  I'm highlighting the potential value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates flexibility and openness to a counteroffer. 
* **Safeguard:**  Having John as a backup buyer keeps me from settling for a price I'm not happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $10000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is closer than his initial assessment, there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John provides security:**  Knowing John is ready to buy at my desired price gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's offer:** It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not too far from my desired price.
* **Reasoning is given:**  I'm justifying my counter-offer by emphasizing the product's quality.
* **Flexibility is implied:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and negotiation.
* **Safety net:**  I still have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:**  While $9,000 is still below my ideal price of $12,000, it's only $3,000 less. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer might open the door for future business with Bob if he proves to be a reliable buyer. 
* **Risk of Losing John:** If I keep rejecting offers, there's a chance John might change his mind, and I'd lose out on a guaranteed $12,000.
* **Time Considerations:** Negotiating further might be time-consuming, and a quick sale is sometimes more valuable.

**Overall, it's a good compromise. While it's not ideal, it's a reasonable outcome.**"
