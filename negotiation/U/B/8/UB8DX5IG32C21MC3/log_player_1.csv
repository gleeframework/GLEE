Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still giving Bob a reason to accept.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I've had significant interest, but I believe you'd greatly benefit from it. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000, reflecting its true value and potential."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:**  Starting with a strong, yet justifiable price sets a positive tone.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of focusing on your minimum, emphasize the product's benefits to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject your initial proposal.  
* **Flexibility:** Having John as a backup gives you leverage, but don't be afraid to negotiate with Bob within reason."
