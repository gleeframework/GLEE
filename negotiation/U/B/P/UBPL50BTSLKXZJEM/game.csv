"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value to you, I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective,  $900,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000?  This allows us both to walk away with a substantial gain. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
