"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.  This will test the waters and see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $10,000, which is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. I believe this counteroffer is a good middle ground that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is still slightly lower than my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his last offer and is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's better to accept his offer now and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for less."
