**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good discount, it's still above my personal limit of $150. I'll try to negotiate further to get a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
