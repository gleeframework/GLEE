{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $8,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm also open to negotiation, which is why I've included a friendly message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum desired price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target with further negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $8,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This price is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider a price of $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm confident I can get closer to my target with further negotiation, so I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. How about $8,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

I'm pushing for my minimum price now. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm not willing to go lower, but I'm hoping Bob will accept."
