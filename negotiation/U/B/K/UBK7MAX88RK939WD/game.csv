"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10500.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the product for the same amount from another seller. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
