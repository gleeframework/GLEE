"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's unique features and my initial offer of $950000, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $875000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, and I'm not willing to go above $850000. Would you be willing to meet me at $850000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
