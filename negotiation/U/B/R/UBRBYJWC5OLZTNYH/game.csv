"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Can you consider my offer?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is simply too low for me. How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's meet halfway.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $130. Can you consider my offer?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and it allows us to reach an agreement.",135.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $130, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
