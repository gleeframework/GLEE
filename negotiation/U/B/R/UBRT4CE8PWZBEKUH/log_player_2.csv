"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe you'd be interested in. It's valued at no less than $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to get a better deal through counteroffers, especially considering Alice values the product at $1,500,000."

I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, my maximum price point.  This would still be a substantial gain for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1000000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1750000. This allows you to get a good deal, while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. There's still potential to get a better price, and I'm not comfortable paying over $1,000,000."
