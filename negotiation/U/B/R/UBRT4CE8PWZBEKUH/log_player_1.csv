Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000, my maximum price point.  This would still be a substantial gain for you considering your own valuation.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
