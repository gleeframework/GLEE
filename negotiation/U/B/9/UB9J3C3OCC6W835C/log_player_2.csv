{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to his desired range. This initial counteroffer is a bold move, designed to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially establish a lower price range for subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, Bob can still potentially save more money. It's important to remember that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price in the next round. There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price, giving him room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's previous offer while still trying to get a better price. This approach shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to meet her halfway.  By increasing his offer slightly, Bob increases the chances of Alice accepting, while still keeping the price lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000. This is a good deal for Bob, especially considering he can buy the product from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer will save Bob $200,000, bringing him closer to his goal of saving money.  

While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting future offers and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is a significant factor.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice to ensure Bob gets the product while saving a substantial amount of money."
