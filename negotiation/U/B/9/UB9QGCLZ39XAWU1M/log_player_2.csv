"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $100, but Alice is asking for $90. 
* **Negotiation is worth it:** There's room for negotiation, as you're willing to pay more than Alice's value of $80.  
* **Counteroffer will be beneficial:** A counteroffer will allow you to potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we settle on $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your limit:**  While $87.5 is higher than your ideal price, it's still within your budget. 
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:** It's possible to negotiate further, but it's not clear how much lower Alice will go. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject the offer and Alice's counteroffer is even higher, you might end up paying the full $100 to John.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer is the most sensible option, as it saves you money compared to buying from John and is likely a fair compromise."
