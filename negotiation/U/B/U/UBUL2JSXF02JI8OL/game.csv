"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $100, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? That seems like a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to an agreement, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $95. That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
