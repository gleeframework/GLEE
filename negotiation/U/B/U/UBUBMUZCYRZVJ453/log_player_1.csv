Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $120, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $119, a slightly lower offer like $100 leaves space for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he counters. This also prevents you from accidentally anchoring the negotiation too high. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have John as a reliable backup buyer at $80, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob."
