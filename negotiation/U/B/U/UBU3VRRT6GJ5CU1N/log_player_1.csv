""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves him room to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal if he values the product more than that.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If we knew Bob was a tough negotiator, we might start even higher to give us more bargaining room.
* **Relationship Building:** This offer assumes a purely transactional approach. If a long-term relationship with Bob is desired, a different strategy might be employed."
