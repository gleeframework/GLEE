Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $900,000?  This would be a significant discount from my initial offer and a good value for you."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. Can you consider that?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is tempting, I think I can still push for a slightly higher price.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get a good deal, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this unique product.  Let's try $875,000. This would be a good middle ground, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to go up to $860000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Although it's still below my initial target, it's only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing out on a potential sale with John in the remaining rounds."
