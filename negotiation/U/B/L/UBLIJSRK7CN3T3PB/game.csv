"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a proposal that might work for both of us. How about we agree on a price of $13,500 for the product? This price reflects the value I place on the product while allowing for a reasonable profit margin. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
