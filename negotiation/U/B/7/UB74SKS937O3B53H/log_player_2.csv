It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  You have room to go lower before you'd be better off buying from John."

I'm offering $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

While $725,000 is better than John's price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. I'll make another counteroffer."

I'm going to offer $710,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm serious about getting a deal but I'm still willing to negotiate."

Alice has come down to $720,000. This is a good price, and although it's still higher than my last offer, it's getting closer to my target. I'd rather avoid further negotiation and risk Alice walking away."
