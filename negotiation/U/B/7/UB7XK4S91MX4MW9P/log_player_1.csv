{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum. This allows for some room for negotiation without risking a loss for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be interested in paying $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum.  It's better to try to negotiate a higher price than accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $150? This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable price for my product."", ""product_price"": 150}
