"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 was a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
