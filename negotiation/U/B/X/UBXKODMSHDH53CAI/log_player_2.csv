"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $900,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $850,000?

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice.  While her offer of $850,000 is getting closer to John's price, you know you have a guaranteed option at $800,000. There's no point in risking further negotiation rounds when you can secure the product at your target price elsewhere."
