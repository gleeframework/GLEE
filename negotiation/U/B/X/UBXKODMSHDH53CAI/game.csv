"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,100,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working with a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $900,000 is closer, my absolute limit is $700,000. If that works, I'm ready to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,5,
