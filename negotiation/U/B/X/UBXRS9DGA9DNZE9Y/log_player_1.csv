Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but below your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures you're not immediately giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the worth of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my target. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I've carefully considered our previous discussions and am willing to go up to $1,060,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation.  Given John is willing to pay my desired price, selling to John is the best option to maximize my profit."
