Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **I want to maximize my profit.**  Even though Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product,  I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.
* **I have 9 more rounds to work with.** I can still send counteroffers to try and reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints. While I appreciate your counteroffer, it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000 to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to counteroffer at $1,625,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  It's only $125,000 below my initial asking price of $1,750,000.
* **We are in the 4th round, meaning I have 6 rounds left.**  It's unlikely I'll be able to significantly increase the price further.
* **Accepting this offer would secure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiations.**  There's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds, and there's always a chance Bob could reject my counteroffers or even decide to walk away from the deal.

**Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is the most logical and profitable decision at this point.**"
