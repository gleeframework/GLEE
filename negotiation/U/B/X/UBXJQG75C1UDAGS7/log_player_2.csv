"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get in on the ground floor. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. It's a fair middle ground, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?
