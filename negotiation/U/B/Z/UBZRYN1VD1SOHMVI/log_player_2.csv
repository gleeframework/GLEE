"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I believe it's worth at least $12000 to you. I'm offering it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and it gives you a chance to own it before someone else does. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
