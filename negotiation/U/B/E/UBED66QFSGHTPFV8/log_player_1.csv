Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it will be highly valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 150} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential to negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:** You always have the option of selling to John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $110 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your threshold. You have room to negotiate further, and there's a chance to get closer to $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I value your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $130. This product offers significant value that I'm confident you'll benefit from."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to your minimum price but still holding a strong position. A $20 decrease from your initial offer might seem significant to Bob and encourage him to counter again.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the higher price.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  We're still above John's offer, but leaving room for one more potential counter from Bob before considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $130. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 less than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might only yield a few dollars more, and there's a risk of Bob walking away altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now saves you time and effort in finding another buyer."
