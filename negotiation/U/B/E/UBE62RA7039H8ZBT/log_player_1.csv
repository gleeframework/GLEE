Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $8,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is only $200 less than my minimum price, and I'm getting closer to a deal.  I'll accept his offer for now."
