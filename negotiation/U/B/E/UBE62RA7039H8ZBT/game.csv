"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $8,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,200.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8200.0,Bob,4,
