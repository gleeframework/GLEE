"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $900,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
