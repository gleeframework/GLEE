"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, that price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. That's closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
