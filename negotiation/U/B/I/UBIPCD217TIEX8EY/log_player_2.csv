"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, that price is a little high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and appreciative:** Maintaining a positive tone can encourage continued negotiation.
* **Establish a lower anchor:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's offer can help shift the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Offering $60 leaves space for Alice to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a better price, we can still try to negotiate a bit closer to our $80 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. That's closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Acknowledge the compromise:** Recognizing Alice's move helps maintain goodwill.
* **Push slightly closer to your limit:**  $75 is a small increase from your previous offer but still keeps you under budget.
* **Frame it as a ""win-win"":**  Using language like ""fair compromise"" aims to make Alice feel good about accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $85. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $85. Accepting this offer gets us the product for less than our $80 limit with John."
