"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [Product Name] at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial.  While I value this product at no less than $800,000, I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its true value to you. Please consider my offer of $1,000,000. It's a significant savings for you, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or proceed with buying from John at a better price."
