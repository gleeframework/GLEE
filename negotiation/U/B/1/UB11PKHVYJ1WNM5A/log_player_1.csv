Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** Bob is stubbornly refusing to budge above $10,000. While he's getting closer, I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum acceptable price. It's not worth the risk of Bob lowballing further in the remaining rounds.  It's time to take the guaranteed profit."
