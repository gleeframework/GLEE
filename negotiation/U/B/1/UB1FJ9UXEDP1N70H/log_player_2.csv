"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. I'm willing to start with an offer of $10,000, which is a very competitive price considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is good, Bob can likely get a better price.  There's no reason to accept it on the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, as it aligns with my budget and value assessment. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a good deal for Bob. He values the product at $12,000 and can save $1,500 by accepting. 
* While there might be some room for negotiation, it's not clear that Bob can get a significantly lower price.  
* There's a risk of the negotiation stalling or Alice walking away, in which case Bob would have to pay $12,000 to John. 

Therefore, accepting the offer at $10,500 is the most logical choice in this round."
