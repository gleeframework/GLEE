"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive pricing. However, I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, as it aligns with my budget and value assessment. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise given the product's worth to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
