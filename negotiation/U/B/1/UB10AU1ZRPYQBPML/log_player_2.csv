"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is getting closer to an acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Open:** My message is polite and expresses continued interest.  I don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering $110, I'm aiming for a price that's a good deal for me but still potentially profitable for Alice (remember, her value is $120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $125? This is a fair price considering the value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $125 is a good price, saving me $25 off John's offer and falling within my acceptable range.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is likely close to her lowest acceptable price. Pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
