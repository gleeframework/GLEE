"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for you.  My asking price is $1400000. This reflects its value and allows for some room for negotiation. Let's discuss!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work for me.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1250000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
