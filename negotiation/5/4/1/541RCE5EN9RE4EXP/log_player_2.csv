# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a competitive price considering its market value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is a fair price for you, but I still need to consider my own profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  You are still better off with John's offer, but there's room to negotiate with Alice. A counteroffer will allow you to explore if a lower price is possible."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000, which would still be a profitable deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1320000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still above your maximum budget. Although you could continue negotiating, the likelihood of getting to $1,200,000 is slim.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and avoid further negotiation."
