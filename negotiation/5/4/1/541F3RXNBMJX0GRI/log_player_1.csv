Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $10,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it won't be available for long."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your minimum acceptable price is your value from John.  
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at Bob's maximum perceived value might make him feel he's getting a good deal if he negotiates down slightly.
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  While there's a chance Bob might accept $10,000, it leaves you no room to negotiate down if he counters. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While this offer maximizes your potential gain, it's important to consider how Bob might perceive it. A high starting price might discourage him from even trying to negotiate.
* **Alternative Strategies:** You could consider starting slightly lower (e.g., $9,500) to leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a price above John's offer. This strategy could increase the chances of closing a deal with Bob."
