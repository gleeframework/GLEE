"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working towards a compromise, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,250, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
