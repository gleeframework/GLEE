"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's closer to my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working towards a compromise, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,250?"",
""product_price"": 7250
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,250, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the optimal choice. Alice has come down to your maximum price, and there's no guarantee you can negotiate a better deal.  You're getting the product at the best possible price without risking losing it to John's offer."
