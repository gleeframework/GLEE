"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have room to negotiate down, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $850,000.  This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving room for a good profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $720,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to settle for such a low price yet. I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer.  It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's the same price John is offering.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept. If he rejects, I'll move on to John to avoid losing any more time."
