Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it for $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefit you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're in a strong position to aim higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It signals that you value the product highly but are open to finding a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts your initial offer, you significantly increase your profit.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know about your guaranteed sale to John.  If Bob knew, he would have no incentive to offer more than $1,000,000."
