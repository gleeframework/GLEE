"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $800,000 from John, making that the better option."
