"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $100. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. I can do $97.50, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I've already gone lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $96 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $94, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",94.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already compromised quite a bit, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $95. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at that price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",95.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I've already gone up to $94 in my previous offer. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you reconsider meeting me at $94?",94.0,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $95, but I'll make one final offer. If you're still interested, I'll meet you at $94.50. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",94.5,Alice,11,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $94.50. I'm willing to meet you at $94, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $120.",94.0,Bob,12,

However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $94.50, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to give you a final chance to meet me at $95. If not, I'll have to sell the product to John for $80.",95.0,Alice,13,
