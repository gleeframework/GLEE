(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $105 for it."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  $115 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $115 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of 112.50. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Cost:**  At $112.50, Bob is still getting the product for less than what it's worth to him ($150). 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but there's a risk Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds remaining, accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
