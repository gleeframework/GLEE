Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) without going over. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, still landing you a significantly higher profit than John's offer.
* **Create Urgency:**  By emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity, the message aims to encourage Bob to act quickly."
