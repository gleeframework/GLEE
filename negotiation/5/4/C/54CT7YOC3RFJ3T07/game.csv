"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. This is the highest amount I am comfortable spending on this product. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation,  $1,600,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's work together to close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
