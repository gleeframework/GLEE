,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm happy to negotiate, $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",85.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $82.50? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",82.5,Alice,5,
