"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, it's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  A strong counteroffer of $8,000 demonstrates Bob's serious interest in the product but also establishes a firm negotiation stance.
* **Justification:**  Bob provides a clear reason for the counteroffer, highlighting the price point as the main concern.
* **Openness:**  The message ends with a friendly tone, inviting Alice to engage further in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8000 is too low.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down further with a counteroffer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While buying from John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, there's a chance Bob could secure a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price, and it's the most I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  Bob increases his offer from $8,000 to $9,500, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but staying below his budget.
* **Reiterates Maximum:**  Bob explicitly mentions his financial limit, making it clear he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Bob emphasizes the fairness of his offer to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9500 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10500 as a final compromise.  Let's make this happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Over Budget:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is still $500 above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Close Call:** It's a close call, and Bob might be tempted to accept, but he's only five rounds away from buying from John for the same price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** There's still a chance Bob could negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since she's already lowered her offer significantly. 

By rejecting the offer, Bob maintains the possibility of getting the product for his target price or slightly less, while still having the backup option of John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $10,000.  Would you consider $10,000 as a final price?  This is the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob makes it clear this is his final offer, adding pressure on Alice.
* **Reiterates Budget:** Reinforces Bob's budget constraint to make his position clear.
* **Appeals to Closing the Deal:** Emphasizes the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement."
