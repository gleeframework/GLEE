Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $19,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $10,000, giving us a starting point for negotiation.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to $19,000 as possible. Starting high allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 provides a safety net. This means we don't have to go below $15,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:** While we know Bob's valuation, he doesn't know ours. We need to present the product in a way that justifies the high price. 
* **Negotiation:** This is just an initial offer. Bob might counter-offer, and we'll need to decide if we want to negotiate or stick closer to our minimum price."
