Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm looking for a quick sale. Please let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower initially allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The phrase ""quick sale"" might encourage Bob to act fast and potentially accept the offer.
* **High but Negotiable:** The price is high, reflecting the product's value to you. However, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested, potentially leading to a price higher than $15,000.

This strategy prioritizes getting the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
