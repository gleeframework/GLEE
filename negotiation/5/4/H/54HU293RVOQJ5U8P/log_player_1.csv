Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (to John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $2,000 profit margin if you can sell to Bob for a price between $10,001 and $12,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming closer to $12,000 is ideal. However, being too aggressive might make Bob reject the offer.  It's about finding a balance.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm offering it at a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss it further."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:** $11,500 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate if needed while still aiming for a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message encourages Bob to engage in conversation, allowing for potential counter-offers or questions.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might consider a slightly lower starting point.
* **Your Risk Tolerance:**  If you're risk-averse, starting lower (e.g., $11,000) increases the chance of a sale but lowers potential profit."
