Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? I believe this would still allow me to acquire the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
