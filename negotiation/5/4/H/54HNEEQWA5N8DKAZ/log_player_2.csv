# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save $300,000 by going with John."
