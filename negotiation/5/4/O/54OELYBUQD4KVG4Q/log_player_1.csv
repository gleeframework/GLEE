Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above my minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant savings for Bob compared to the product's value to him ($8,000), making it a tempting offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John, putting the money in my pocket sooner.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting higher leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above $12,000.

This approach balances maximizing potential profit with the certainty of a sale to John."
