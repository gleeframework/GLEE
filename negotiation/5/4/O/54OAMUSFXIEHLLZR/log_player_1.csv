Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer aims to get a good price while still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a fair starting point, as it's significantly more than my minimum value but still below Bob's perceived value. This strategy keeps the negotiation open and allows for flexibility to either accept a counteroffer or move on to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum of $80.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and secures a good profit.  While I could try for a higher price, there's no guarantee I'll succeed, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
