Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet the $1,000,000 threshold that guarantees me a profit. John's offer is a sure thing at this point, and further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of ending up with a less favorable outcome."
