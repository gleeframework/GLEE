# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

It's always a good idea to start by rejecting the initial offer.  You can then make a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $1050000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1150000. Let me know if that's more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

While $1,150,000 is closer to your target, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  You can try to negotiate further by making another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1100000, Bob! However, I'm still a bit far from my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer at $1120000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $1,120,000, which is closer to your target. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more. Buying from Alice at this price is a good deal considering you can get it for $1,000,000 from John, but it saves you the time and effort of further negotiations."
