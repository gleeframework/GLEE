Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit beyond what I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.
