"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,200,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering my maximum spending limit. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still a bit beyond what I can comfortably spend.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. I believe it's a reasonable compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
