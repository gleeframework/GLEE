"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $11200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $11200 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $10800. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10800 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer it to you for $10900. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10900.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $10900 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget constraints.",10500.0,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $10600 is still a bit too high for me. I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit, and I'll have to pass on this offer. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,10,
