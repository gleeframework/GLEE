"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,050,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let me know if this works for you, as I'm running short on time and might need to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're running short on time, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me here.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
