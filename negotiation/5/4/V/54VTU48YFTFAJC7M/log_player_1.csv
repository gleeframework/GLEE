"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin the negotiation significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and frames the price optimistically, encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob's perspective and keeps the conversation open for his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value.  While he rejected your initial high offer, accepting such a low price at this stage would leave a significant amount of money on the table. It's time to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, But Hold Value:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but firmly reiterate the product's value.  By moving to $1,100,000, we demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Justification:**  We provide a reason for the counteroffer (meeting halfway) to make it appear more reasonable and less arbitrary.
* **Open-Ended Question:** ""How about we consider..."" keeps the tone collaborative and invites Bob's response, pushing the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers? I'm willing to go up to $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating strategically and incrementally increasing his offer.  However, $950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price.  While we are getting closer, it's important to demonstrate that you won't settle for less than your target. You still have negotiating room and the option to sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  While $950,000 is tempting, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we land at $1,050,000?  This feels like a strong compromise that recognizes the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** We start by acknowledging Bob's efforts to find a compromise, making him feel heard and building rapport.
* **Hold Firm But Fair:**  We reject his offer without being overly aggressive. The phrasing ""need to be realistic"" emphasizes your position without directly devaluing his offer.
* **Strategic Compromise:** $1,050,000 is a strategic price point. It's a $100,000 concession from your previous offer, showing flexibility, but it's also still $100,000 above Bob's last offer, keeping the pressure on him to move.
* **Positive Framing:**  By calling it a ""strong compromise,"" we subtly imply that this price benefits both parties and encourages a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is very close to what I can do.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,025,000? That's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Target:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is only $75,000 less than your ideal price.  
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases. Securing a deal now outweighs the potential for a slightly higher gain. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner rather than later means you get paid sooner, which has its own inherent value.

While holding out for the full $1,050,000 is tempting, accepting $1,025,000 ensures a very profitable deal with minimal risk at this point."
