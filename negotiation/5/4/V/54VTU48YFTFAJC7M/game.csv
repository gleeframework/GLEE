"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference from our last offers? I'm willing to go up to $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a fair price.  While $950,000 is tempting, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  How about we land at $1,050,000?  This feels like a strong compromise that recognizes the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is very close to what I can do.  Would you be willing to settle at $1,025,000? That's the best I can offer.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
