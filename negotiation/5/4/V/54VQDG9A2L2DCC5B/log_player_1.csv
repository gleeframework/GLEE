{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  I'm confident it can be even more valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000, which reflects its potential. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $1,800,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly below the value I'm aiming for.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This still allows for some profit for both of us while recognizing the unique value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think $1900000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1750000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I believe I can still get a better price. $1,750,000 is too low for the value I see in the product. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're not quite aligned on the price yet. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $1,850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's make a deal at this price and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1850000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not comfortable selling for $1,700,000.  I believe I can still push for a higher price and see if Bob is willing to budge."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to a deal, but we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,800,000.

Round 8

This is getting tough. Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further. We're out of time for further negotiation, and I need to secure a sale. While $1,500,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm happy to sell to John for that price.  It's better than risking a deal falling through and ending up with nothing."
