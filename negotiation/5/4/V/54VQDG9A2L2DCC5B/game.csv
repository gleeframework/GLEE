"Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a valuable asset that is worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm confident it can be even more valuable to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2000000, which reflects its potential. Let's discuss!",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1800000 is significantly below the value I'm aiming for.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This still allows for some profit for both of us while recognizing the unique value of this product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're not quite aligned on the price yet. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go lower than $1850000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's make a deal at this price and move forward.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
