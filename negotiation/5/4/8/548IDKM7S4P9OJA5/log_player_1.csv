Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while still leaving some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
