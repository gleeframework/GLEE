"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'm confident that Bob, valuing the product at $120, will be motivated to negotiate a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering Bob's value of the product and my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $105.  I'm happy to accept this deal.  It's a fair price and I'm confident that I've secured a good outcome for myself."
