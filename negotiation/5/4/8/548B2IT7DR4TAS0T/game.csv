"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $800000. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it right now, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between your budget and the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1050000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in this product. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value and the fact that you're still below my initial offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and shows my flexibility in the negotiation.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
