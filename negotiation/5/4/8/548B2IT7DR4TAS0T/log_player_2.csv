# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $800,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it right now, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between your budget and the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still outside of his comfort zone. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it shows my genuine interest in this product. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. Considering the product's value and the fact that you're still below my initial offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and shows my flexibility in the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where the negotiations are unlikely to yield a price within his budget. Alice's offer is still above his maximum and there is no guarantee she will come down further.  Buying from John is a safer option as it guarantees a price within his budget."
