"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it will be very valuable for you. I'm looking for a price of $14,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way too high. It's significantly more than your maximum budget and even more than her own valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchor low:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. While this is a big jump from her initial offer, it demonstrates that you're serious about getting a good price and willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for movement:** This offer leaves plenty of space for counteroffers and allows you to gradually increase your price without going over your $10,000 limit.
* **Polite and collaborative:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone encourages Alice to engage in the negotiation rather than be immediately turned off by a lowball offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about meeting in the middle at $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign, but $11,000 is still above both your budget and closer to her valuation. You have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,500? That feels like a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  You are moving closer to her price, showing that you're flexible and want to find an agreement.
* **Stay below your budget:** This counteroffer keeps you safely below your $10,000 maximum.
* **Aim for a win-win:**  While still pushing for a good deal for yourself, this price gives Alice a significant profit margin as well, making it mutually beneficial."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  My final offer is $10,500. This is a great price for a product that I know you'll find valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's not willing to negotiate further.
* **Minimal savings:**  Even if you could get Alice down a little more in subsequent rounds, the potential savings are now very small compared to John's offer. 
* **Time is valuable:** You've already spent several rounds, and further negotiation might not be worth the effort for a tiny potential discount. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. You can get the product for a sure $10,000 from John, which is within your budget and saves you time and energy."
