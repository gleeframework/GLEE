"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  How about meeting in the middle at $11,000?  This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price we can both agree on.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,500? That feels like a fair deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're a tough negotiator!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  My final offer is $10,500. This is a great price for a product that I know you'll find valuable.",10500.0,Alice,5,
