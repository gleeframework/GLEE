Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $110, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I know the product is worth at least $100 to me, and I'm hoping to get as close to that as possible."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offers have been getting closer, but I'm running out of time. It's better to secure the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk getting less from Bob."
