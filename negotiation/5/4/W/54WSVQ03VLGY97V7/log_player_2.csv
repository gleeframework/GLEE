"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life significantly. Considering its value, I believe it's worth more than $100 to you. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $95 is above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's benefits. However, $95 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his counteroffer close to his maximum budget of $80, but still offering a price that is lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to negotiate a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. I would like to propose an offer of $90 for the product, which I believe is a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price.  Bob can potentially secure a deal closer to his desired price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $87.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of offering slightly higher than his desired price, while still trying to negotiate a lower price than Alice's last offer.  He's showing flexibility while remaining firm on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. To further accommodate your needs, I am proposing a price of $89 for the product. This is a slight increase from your last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product offers you. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80. While it's getting closer, continuing to negotiate risks exhausting the remaining rounds without reaching a satisfactory price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product from John for $80. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further potential price increases from Alice."
