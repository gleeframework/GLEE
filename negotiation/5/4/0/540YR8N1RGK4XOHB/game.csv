"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950000 is still too low. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is closer to your offer but still reflects the value of this product.  Let's try to bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1100000. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $1075000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
