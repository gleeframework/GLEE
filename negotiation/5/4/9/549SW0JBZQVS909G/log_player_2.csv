# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me.

Alice is still too high for my budget.  It's getting down to the wire, and I don't want to risk going another round and potentially losing the deal altogether. I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000. It's a fair price, and I can't risk getting stuck with a higher price."
