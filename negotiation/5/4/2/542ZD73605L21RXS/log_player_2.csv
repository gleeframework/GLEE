"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than the initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $8,000 is the best option for Bob."
