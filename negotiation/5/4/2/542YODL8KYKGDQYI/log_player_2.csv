"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for your consideration. Given its value to you, I'm thinking a price of $1,000,000 would be a fair starting point.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a decent starting point, Bob can likely get a better deal. He has a significant advantage knowing the product is only worth $800,000 to Alice.  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better.  He knows the product's true value to Alice, and there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting keeps the door open to potentially get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $937,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's aim for a resolution this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $937,500, which is a very good price for Bob. While he could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or increase her offer, making it less favorable.  At this point, accepting the offer ensures Bob gets a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity or paying more to John."
