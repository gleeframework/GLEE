"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your position.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and would allow me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,4,
