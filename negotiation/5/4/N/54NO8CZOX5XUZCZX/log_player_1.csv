{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (her guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Balance:** The offer is significantly above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, making it unlikely he'd accept immediately. However, it's presented as a fair deal, encouraging negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice's strong fallback position with John allows her to confidently price high.

**Outcome:**

* **Ideal:** Bob accepts the offer, or negotiates close to it, giving Alice a great profit.
* **Acceptable:** Bob rejects the offer, Alice sells to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
