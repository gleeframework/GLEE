"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $950,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $925,000? That's the highest I can go.",925000.0,Bob,4,
