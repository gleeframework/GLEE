I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still potentially appealing to Bob. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm going to reject Bob's offer. I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. Hopefully, it's a sweet spot that will entice Bob to accept."
