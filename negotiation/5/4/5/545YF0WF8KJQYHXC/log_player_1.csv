"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $75 is too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 82.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum, and I've already had 3 rounds of negotiation. It's time to close the deal."
