"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider this?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. Its unique features and potential make it a worthwhile investment at a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I can do $1,125,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, and I hope we can close the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,237,500? This offer reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budgetary considerations.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
