"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth $80 to me, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $85.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $80 for the product. Alice's offer of $85 exceeds this limit.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $80, rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
