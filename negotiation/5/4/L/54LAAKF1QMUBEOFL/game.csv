"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty about your budget, Bob.  While $1,600,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand your constraints.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price still reflects the significant value this product brings.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,350,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
