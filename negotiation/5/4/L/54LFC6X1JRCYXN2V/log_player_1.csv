{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  There's room for negotiation, as Bob values the product higher.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It shows you're serious about selling but leaves room for compromise.

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a potential back-and-forth negotiation, allowing you to maximize your profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:**  You've stated your minimum is $10,000, and Bob's offer is exactly that.  This means you're not making any profit.
* **You have a better option:** You can sell to John for $10,000, which is a guaranteed profit. 
* **You can counter-offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counter-offer and try to get closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll likely want to make a counter-offer that's slightly above Bob's offer but below your original price.  This shows you're willing to negotiate but also want to maximize your profit."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This gives us both a good deal, and ensures you get the product you're interested in.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise, coming down from your initial $11,500 but still above Bob's offer of $10,500.
* **Maintain profit:**  This price still yields a decent profit for you while showing flexibility.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 

By offering $11,000, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below your minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below your minimum desired price of $10,000. This means you would be losing money on the deal.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** You can sell the product to John for $10,000, which guarantees you a profit and eliminates any risk of further negotiation. 
* **Limited room for compromise:**  There's not much room left for further negotiation, and you're already at the point of accepting a price below your minimum.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob's offer is still too low, and you have a guaranteed buyer in John, it's best to reject Bob's offer and move on to a sure profit with John."
