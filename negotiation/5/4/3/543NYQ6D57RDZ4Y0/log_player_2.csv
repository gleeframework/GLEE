"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm pricing it at $20,000.  I think you'll agree it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $15,000.  There's no need to accept Alice's offer at this point."

Bob should reject the offer. While $17,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $15,000. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
