{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than your minimum. This allows for room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm not willing to go that low just yet.  I believe I can get closer to my target price with some further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,250 is a fair compromise and it's significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.  It's important to remember that this deal still nets me a profit and avoids the risk of potentially losing out on a sale if I continue to negotiate."
