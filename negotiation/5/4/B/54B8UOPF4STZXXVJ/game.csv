,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $94, which is a fair compromise. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal at this price.",94.0,Alice,5,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $91 for the product. Can you consider that?,91.0,Bob,6,
