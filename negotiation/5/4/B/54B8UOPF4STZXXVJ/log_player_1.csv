Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to $100. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $92 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to go down to $94, which is a fair compromise. If you're serious about buying this product, let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 94}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $91 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price.  I've already gone down from my initial asking price, and I'm not comfortable continuing to go lower. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
