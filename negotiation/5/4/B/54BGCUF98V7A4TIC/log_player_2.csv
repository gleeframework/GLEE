"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit too high though.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
