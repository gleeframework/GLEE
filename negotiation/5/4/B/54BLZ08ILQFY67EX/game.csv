"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our discussion.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe it leaves room for both of us to come out ahead.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a little steep for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close the deal here.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $825,000 is still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering the value to me and the fact that it's right at your minimum.  Let's see if we can finally strike a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
