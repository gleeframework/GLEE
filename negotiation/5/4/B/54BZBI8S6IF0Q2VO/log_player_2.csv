Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're trying to work with me, but $750,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $800,000. This would be a great deal for you, and it's my minimum. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best possible outcome for you (Bob). Alice is at her lowest price (her product's value) and this is well below your maximum budget.  There's no point in trying to haggle further as you risk Alice walking away."
