Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $700,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
