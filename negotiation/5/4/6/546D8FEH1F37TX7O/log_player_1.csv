{""product_price"": 120}

This price is higher than your minimum threshold of $80, but it's also significantly less than the value of the product for Bob. This allows for potential negotiation and leaves space for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal, while still ensuring you earn more than you would by selling to John."
