,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a different perspective on the value, but $1,075,000 is simply too low for me. Given our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Let's close this deal at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our positions.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been going back and forth, and I understand your perspective. However, $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me to sell.  I'm willing to make a final concession, but this is it. I'm offering the product for $1,075,000. It's a fair price considering the value we both recognize, and it allows us to close this deal.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
