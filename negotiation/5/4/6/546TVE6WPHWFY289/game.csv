"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $140?  I really like the product, but my budget is tight.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit high.  How about $155?  That's a fair compromise, and I think we can close the deal.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $155. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $165. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",165.0,Alice,5,
