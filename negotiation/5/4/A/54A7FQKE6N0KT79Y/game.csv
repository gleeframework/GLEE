"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to own something that's worth $15000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the deal, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000, which reflects a good value for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair price that balances the value it holds for you with my minimum requirement. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10000.  How about we split the difference at $10750? This would be a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to split the difference, but $10750 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $12200? This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to meet your target price, but $12200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to come up to $11250.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your need for profit while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $11250, but I still need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11250 and $12200, which would be $11725. This is a fair price that balances our needs and gets me closer to my minimum requirement.",11725.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $11725 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $11500? This would be a fair compromise and a great price for both of us. It's time for us to come to an agreement. Let's close this deal!",11500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $12000? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but $12000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11750, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer.  If you're serious about making a deal, I need to hear from you now.",11750.0,Bob,10,
