Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation shows you understand its worth to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price that's still very profitable for you. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale to John at $800,000 if Bob refuses.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his valuation and leaving open the possibility of a mutually agreeable deal."
