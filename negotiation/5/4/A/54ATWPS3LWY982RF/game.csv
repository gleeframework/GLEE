"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a savvy negotiator! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $105? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we try $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not sure I can go much higher than that.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. How about we try $115? It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to lose interest in the deal, Alice. I think we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but if I don't get a better offer, I'll have to walk away. This is my final offer.",92.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one final offer. How about we meet at $108? It's a bit higher than my previous offers, but I think it's a fair price for the product.",108.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm afraid I've reached my limit, Alice. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. I'll meet you at $90, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",90.0,Bob,10,
