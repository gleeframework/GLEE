"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $10,000. It's worth negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget. I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be attractive to her while still being advantageous to me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000.  This represents a fair price considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer while staying within my budget.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also have a firm price limit."
