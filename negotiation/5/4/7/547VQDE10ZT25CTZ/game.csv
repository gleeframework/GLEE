"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you meet me halfway?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  To be frank, $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair deal considering its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1,025,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
