Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $950,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still significantly underselling the product's value to both of us. While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. We need to show him we're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but the gap between our positions is still quite large.  To be frank, $950,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair deal considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $1,025,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is finally getting close to a reasonable offer. Accepting $1,025,000 gives us a good profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of pushing him away entirely. It's always better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially slightly better one later."
