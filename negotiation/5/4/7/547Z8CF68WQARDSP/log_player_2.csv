"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it brings, we propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional opportunity. We believe this is a fair and competitive offer, taking into account both the product's worth and your potential satisfaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant gain for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to present an alternative that might better suit our current discussion. Given the value of the product and your interest, we are proposing a price of $900,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account both the product's worth and your budget constraints. I hope this proposal aligns more closely with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target.  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there are still 7 rounds left. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to go lower.  Bob is still in a good position to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $875,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued engagement in this matter. I've reviewed our previous discussions and would like to suggest a revised price of $890,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between the product's value and your budget considerations. I believe this could be a mutually beneficial arrangement, allowing us to reach a successful conclusion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal, but $890,000 is still above his preferred price. He's already demonstrated his commitment to negotiation, and there are still 5 rounds left.  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further.  At this point, Bob should be confident in his position and aim for a price closer to $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $890,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $875,000. This is a fair price, and we can close the deal without any further delays."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understanding in this negotiation. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept a price of $885,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product and your financial constraints. I look forward to your positive response and the successful conclusion of this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $885,000, Bob is getting close to his limit of 10 rounds. There are only 3 rounds left. If he rejects this offer, there's a chance that Alice won't lower her price further, and he might be left with a worse deal than what John is offering.

It's important to remember that Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since John is offering the product for $800,000, which is below Bob's maximum budget and a better deal than the current negotiation, it's more strategically sound to secure the purchase from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
