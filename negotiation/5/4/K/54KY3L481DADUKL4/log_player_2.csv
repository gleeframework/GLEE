Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $11,000 for our premium product. I believe this strikes a balance between value and affordability for you, while still allowing me to achieve a satisfactory return for the product. Please let me know if this revised offer meets your requirements.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. It's worth attempting one more counteroffer to see if you can get the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I've considered your latest offer carefully. While I'd like to accommodate your budget as much as possible, I must respectfully decline at $10,750. I am now offering the product at $10,900. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to achieve a reasonable return. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $10,900 is now very close to your target price.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small reductions, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible option to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with."
