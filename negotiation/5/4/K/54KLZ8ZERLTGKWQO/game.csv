"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $16000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $18000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $17000.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",17000.0,Bob,4,
