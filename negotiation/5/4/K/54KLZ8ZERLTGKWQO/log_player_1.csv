{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, potentially increasing his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still below your desired price. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $16,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for this unique product. I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $17000.  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $17,000 is a good compromise and within a reasonable range of your desired price. It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price."
