Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise at $850,000. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.

Alice's offer:

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is clearly anchoring to a price above her value. Accepting at $825,000 secures a reasonable deal without risking a stalemate and ending up with John's overpriced offer."
