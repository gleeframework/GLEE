Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price. How about $120?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $120. This is significantly higher than my minimum value of $80, and also leaves some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the value to Bob while also being polite and encouraging him to consider the offer. 

This strategy allows me to:

* **Maximize my profit:**  $120 is a good price point, allowing me to earn more than my minimum value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob is willing to pay more, I can potentially increase the price further.
* **Secure a sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for my minimum value."
