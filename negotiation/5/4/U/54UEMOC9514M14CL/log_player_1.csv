Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,200,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:**  By emphasizing the product's ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to frame the discussion around its worth, not just the price tag. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's response and potential counter-offer.

My strategy is to start high and potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle, aiming for a price that is significantly higher than his $1,000,000 valuation but potentially lower than my guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the guaranteed $1,500,000 John is offering. There's potential for Bob to go higher, so I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While your initial valuation is understandable, this product offers significant long-term value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"", ""product_price"": 1850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** I've come down from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate, but not drastically.  The $1,850,000 keeps me significantly above Bob's offer while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the product's long-term value to justify the higher price point, subtly pushing back against Bob's potentially lower valuation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help gauge Bob's true interest and flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge closer to this range, accepting John's offer becomes the more attractive option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential, but I'm still not convinced it's worth that much. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now higher than John's offer of $1,500,000. It's time to accept and secure the best possible deal."
