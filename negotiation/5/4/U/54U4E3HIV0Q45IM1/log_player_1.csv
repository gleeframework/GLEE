Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000. Any price within this range is mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aim high within the ZOPA. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you at $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** We keep it concise, highlighting the product's value and framing it as an ""opportunity.""
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still securing you a significant profit. 

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You can then decide whether to come down slightly or hold firm.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net, remember, getting the best deal with Bob is ideal."
