Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, so you can be more firm in your pricing.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth, the message implies a higher value by mentioning ""its value.""

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a fair chance to purchase the product."
