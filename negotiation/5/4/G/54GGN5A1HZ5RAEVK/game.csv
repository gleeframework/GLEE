"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,800. It's a great compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. While $8,800 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my interest in a quick deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer it to you for $8,200. It's a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",8200.0,Alice,5,
