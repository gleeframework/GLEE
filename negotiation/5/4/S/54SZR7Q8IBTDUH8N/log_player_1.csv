"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high price without revealing your minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open question, inviting Bob to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room to work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you have room to negotiate. It's unlikely he offered his absolute maximum right away. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a better deal in the following rounds. You have the security of John's offer, but it's still early in the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate by moving significantly from your initial price.
* **Still Strong:** However, the counter-offer is still considerably above both Bob's offer and your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** You're subtly reiterating the product's value to justify the high price without being overly aggressive.
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Tactic:** This common negotiation tactic can make your offer seem more reasonable and encourage Bob to make a similar move upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $925,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer significantly, which is a positive sign. However, you are still ahead of your safety net ($800,000 from John). With six rounds left, it's worth seeing if you can push Bob a little further before considering accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer demonstrates a serious interest in this product, and I respect that. To be fair, I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $880,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value."",
""product_price"": 880000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Progress:** Recognizing Bob's increased offer helps maintain a positive negotiating atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:**  You're showing flexibility by reducing your price, but the decrease is relatively small, keeping you well above your minimum. 
* **Justification:** You're still subtly emphasizing fairness and value, aiming to anchor the negotiation around a higher price point.
* **Urgency (Implied):** By saying ""this feels like a fair compromise,"" you subtly imply that you're getting closer to your final offer, encouraging Bob to move closer to your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $880,000.  My final offer is $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Reserve:** Bob's offer of $825,000 is a reasonable profit above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:**  Bob using the phrase ""final offer"" suggests he is unlikely to go higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk Bob might walk away. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
