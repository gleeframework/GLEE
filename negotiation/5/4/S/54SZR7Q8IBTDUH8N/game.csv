"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product but can only offer $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $925,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $880,000.  My final offer is $825,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",825000.0,Bob,6,
