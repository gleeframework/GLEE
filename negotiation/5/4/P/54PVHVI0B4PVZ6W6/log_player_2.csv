"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to John. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to the highest possible price by stating it's the same price John will offer.  There's no benefit to accepting her offer now. By rejecting, you give yourself the opportunity for her to propose a lower price out of fear of losing the sale to John."
