"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept an offer higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal.  Since he knows he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, he starts by offering a price that is $50,000 less than John's price. This shows Alice he's serious about buying but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his target price, he can still get it for less from John.  There's no reason to accept an offer that's higher than John's price, especially when there are more rounds of negotiation left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. He's trying to find a middle ground between his ideal price and what Alice is willing to accept. This offer is still lower than John's price, giving Bob some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should continue to reject Alice's offer. While it is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He can still negotiate further and try to lower the price even more.  There's no need to settle for a higher price when he can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering John's price. This is a strategic move:

* **It shows Alice he's serious about buying.**  He's not just playing games. 
* **It puts the pressure on Alice.** She needs to decide whether to accept his offer or risk losing the deal.  If she rejects it, she risks Bob walking away and buying from John.

This is also the last offer Bob should make if he wants to avoid buying from John. If Alice rejects this offer, he should buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should buy from John.  Alice's offer is still higher than John's price, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely she'll come down to John's price.  It's better to secure the product at the lowest possible price."
