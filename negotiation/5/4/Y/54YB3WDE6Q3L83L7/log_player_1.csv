I'm going to counter with $13,750.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe this price is still attractive to Bob, while getting me closer to my goal."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a higher price, Bob's offer is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal altogether."
