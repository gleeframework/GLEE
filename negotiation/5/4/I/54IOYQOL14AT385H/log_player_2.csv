"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good value for you and a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his target of $10,000."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000.  This still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He's already shown that he's willing to walk away, so he has leverage.  By rejecting the offer, he can try to push Alice down to $10,500 or even closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $10,750.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875.  This is a fair price considering both our needs, and it would help me avoid selling to John at a lower price.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been successfully negotiating and getting closer to his target price, but Alice's counteroffer of $10,875 is still above his maximum budget.  While further negotiation might be possible,  it's not guaranteed.  At this point, Bob has a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000. To save the most money and avoid potentially getting stuck with a higher price, Bob should choose to buy the product from John."
