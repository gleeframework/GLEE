"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still a good value for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $11000.  This still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $11000 is closer, I'm still only able to offer $10750.  This is a fair price, considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's make this deal happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875.  This is a fair price considering both our needs, and it would help me avoid selling to John at a lower price.  Let's close this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
