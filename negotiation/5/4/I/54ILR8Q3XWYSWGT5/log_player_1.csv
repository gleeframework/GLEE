Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

This is a starting point, and I've chosen a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This is a high initial offer to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. It also allows room for negotiation if needed. 

I'll need to adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I will counter-offer to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,000. This is still higher than my minimum but represents a significant drop from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not willing to sell for Bob's low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum. While I am willing to negotiate, it seems Bob is not willing to get closer to my desired price.  To ensure I don't lose too much value, I will sell the product to John for $15,000."
