Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a classic negotiation situation. I'm starting with my ideal price, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter or move on to John, who offers my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to risk losing Bob's business to try and secure a higher price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm aiming for a middle ground.  $125 is a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still leaving some room for potential negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've carefully considered my budget and I'm willing to offer $110 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not desperate for a sale, and I'm confident I can get closer to $125. I'll make one final counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. If that fails, I'll happily sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $110 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $115.  This is my final offer -  if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm lowering my price to $115, which is only $5 more than his last offer. I'm signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm also setting a firm boundary. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident selling to John for $150, so I have no incentive to negotiate further."
