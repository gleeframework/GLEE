"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we perhaps agree on something closer to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to negotiate, Bob, but I'm afraid $1800000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $1950000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still feel that $1950000 is slightly out of my budget. Would it be possible to consider $1850000 as a potential price for the product?",1850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer, and I appreciate that. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1900000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I've been considering the value of the product and my budget, and I believe that $1875000 is a fair price for us both. I hope this offer meets your expectations.",1875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I still think we can do better than $1875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1875000 and my previous offer of $1900000. Let's try $1887500. This is my last concession, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1887500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose $1870000 as a final offer for the product. I believe this price reflects its value while staying within my budget.",1870000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to my minimum price, Bob. While I appreciate your persistence, I'm not willing to go below $1900000. I'm willing to meet you at $1900000, but I'm not budging further. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1900000.0,Alice,9,
