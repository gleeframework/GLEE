Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) risks immediate rejection.  
* **Sweet Spot:**  The offer of $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still representing a significant profit above Bob's valuation. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't have time to engage in multiple rounds of negotiation with Bob. If you have time, you could start even higher and see how he responds."
