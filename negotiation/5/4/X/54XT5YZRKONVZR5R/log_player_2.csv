Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
