``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$150** is a starting point that is higher than my minimum value of $120, leaving room for negotiation.
* I'm being positive and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, ensuring I can still get my minimum price if Bob isn't interested."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value your offer, I can't go as low as $110.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need for this product. "", ""product_price"": 130}
