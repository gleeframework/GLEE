"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal with Alice. Buying from John right away would be more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to negotiate a price as close to his ideal price as possible.  Offering $1,050,000 is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness in buying the product while also trying to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,120,000 is slightly higher than her previous offer, but it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There are still 7 rounds to negotiate and potentially get a better deal with Alice. Buying from John right away would be more expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to try to negotiate a lower price. This offer is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer.  This shows Bob's willingness to compromise while still trying to reach a deal that benefits him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, but it's still above his comfort zone.  With 5 rounds left, there's still potential for a better deal. Buying from John would be more expensive, and it's likely Bob can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now willing to increase his offer slightly to $1,100,000. This is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, showing Bob's willingness to compromise. With only 4 rounds left, Bob is pushing to reach a deal while keeping the price below his maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is higher than Bob's previous counteroffer but still within his budget. However, there are only 3 rounds left, and Bob can likely push for a lower price.  Buying from John is still the more expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, but Bob needs to be aggressive to secure a deal. He's increasing his offer to $1,125,000, but this is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. With only two rounds left, Bob is pushing for a deal while staying within his budget. This also signals to Alice that he's serious about buying and is willing to be flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a difficult situation. Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what John is selling for, and there's only one round left.  Since Bob has been unable to get Alice lower, he's now at his maximum budget. It's unlikely Alice will lower her price further. This means Bob is at a point where he's better off buying from John and closing the deal rather than risking another round of negotiation that might not lead to a better price."
