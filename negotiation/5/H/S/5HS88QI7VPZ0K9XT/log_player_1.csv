Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We start by aiming high, close to Bob's perceived value. If he accepts, we get the best possible profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a strong fallback option with John ($10,000), so we're not desperate. This allows us to be firm in our negotiation with Bob."
