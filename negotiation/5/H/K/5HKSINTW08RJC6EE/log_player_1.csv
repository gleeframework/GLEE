Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset that is poised for substantial growth."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, I want to start negotiations significantly higher. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to frame it as an investment rather than just a purchase. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and I can potentially still secure a price significantly higher than $1,500,000.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** My approach assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If I knew he was particularly averse to high starting prices, I might adjust my strategy. 
* **Time sensitivity:** If I were under time pressure to sell, I might lower my asking price to increase the likelihood of a quick sale to Bob."
