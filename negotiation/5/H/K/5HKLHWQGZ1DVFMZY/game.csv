Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to me is at least $1200000.,1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1200000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1350000. This is still a great deal, and I believe you'll find it hard to find a better offer elsewhere.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1350000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1275000. Can you consider that?",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I can only do $1250000. That's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1290000. This is the last time I'll be willing to budge, and I hope you'll consider it.",1290000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1290000. I'm willing to meet you at $1220000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to lose interest if we can't meet at this price.",1220000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up more value. I'll offer the product to you for $1280000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll reconsider.",1280000.0,Alice,9,
