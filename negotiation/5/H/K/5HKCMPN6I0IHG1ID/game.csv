"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the value I've put into this product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product highly,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my target price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your target price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value of the product and my original asking price. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me and my initial offer, I'm prepared to go up to $1,050,000.  This represents a significant step towards your position, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. Considering the value of the product and my original asking price, I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I believe it's a good balance between our positions. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
