"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Alice's offer is $120 and your maximum budget is also $120, it's the best option to accept her offer.  There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John as it's the same price."
