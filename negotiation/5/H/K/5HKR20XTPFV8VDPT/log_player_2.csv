"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $12,000. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, he'll try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's initial offer allows him to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price given the value I see in your product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by making a significant reduction in price. Offering $10,000 positions Bob as a serious buyer while leaving room for potential compromise. The message also acknowledges the value of the product, building a foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value you place on it, I am willing to negotiate closer to your suggested price. My counteroffer for the product is $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial offer.  While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting this offer allows him to secure the product for a price that's closer to his desired range while also avoiding the risk of the negotiation breaking down.  He also avoids the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers, potentially leading him to buy from John at a higher price."
