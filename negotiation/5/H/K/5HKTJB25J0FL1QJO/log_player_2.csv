"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent deal, you can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to negotiate down a bit further to avoid losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between Alice's value of $80 and my maximum price of $100. This is a fair compromise and gives Alice some profit while still saving me $10 compared to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $95 to $92, which is a good price for me considering my maximum willingness to pay is $100.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's risky. Alice might reject my counteroffer, and I might end up having to buy from John at $100. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product for less than John's price."
