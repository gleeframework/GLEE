{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept a worse deal, especially since he has multiple rounds to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should start by offering the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is $10,000.  He knows this is John's price, so it's a reasonable starting point. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or counter with a higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,500 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price, and he knows he can get the product for $10,000 from John. He still has time to negotiate further with Alice, aiming to get the price closer to his ideal."
