"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. This strategy allows me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of my willingness to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to go below a certain threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher with another counteroffer. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not under any major pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I'm trying to squeeze out as much value as I can.  $11,500 is still above my minimum, and I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, given that he's already moved up from $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower profit."
