Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This sets a high bar and gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  Since I don't know the value of the product to him, I'm starting with a price that leaves room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial deal.  

I'll keep in mind that I can always fall back to John's offer of $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
