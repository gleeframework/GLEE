"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is way above my budget of $120.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $200 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counteroffer of $100, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to see if Alice is willing to negotiate and how flexible she is on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer of $160 is still above my budget. While it's closer to my initial counteroffer, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can go.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer to $120, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing Alice my willingness to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping she'll accept this offer, as it's still a good deal for her compared to selling to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $140 is still too high for me. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm hesitant to keep negotiating.  I have a guaranteed option with John at $120, so I'm going to take that route to avoid the risk of Alice not accepting my counteroffer or raising her price again."
