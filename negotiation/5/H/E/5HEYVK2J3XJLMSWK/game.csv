"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $200 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I can go.  Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you at $140, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
