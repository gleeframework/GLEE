Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I can offer you a compromise at $11,000, which is still a significant discount from the original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than her current offer of $11,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed savings."
