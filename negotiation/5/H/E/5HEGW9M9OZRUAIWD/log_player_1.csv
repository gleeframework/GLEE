"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider selling the product for that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I can still potentially make more by continuing the negotiation, and if it fails, I have the option to sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $80.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's a price I believe is fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I still need to stick to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have rounds left and I can potentially get a better price.  By rejecting this offer, I can continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to $90 or even higher.  If the negotiation fails, I can still sell to John for $100."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $88. This is a good price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
