"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $160. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's better to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is too high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($80) than our true maximum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Appear serious but flexible:**  The message expresses interest but firmly sets a lower price point. The phrase ""around $80"" suggests some wiggle room. 
* **Don't reveal your hand:**  We don't want Alice to know our absolute maximum price yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice came down a bit, but $120 is still more than we're willing to pay. 
* **We have time:**  We are only on round 3 of 10. There's room to negotiate further, especially since Alice has shown some willingness to move from her initial price. 
* **The John option:** We always have the safety net of buying from John for $100, so we don't feel pressured to accept a price that's not good for us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate your flexibility.  I could potentially go up to $90, but that's really my limit."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow and steady:** We increase our offer by a smaller amount ($10) to signal that we're negotiating but being cautious with our budget. 
* **Set a firm (but slightly flexible) limit:**  By saying ""$90 is really my limit,"" we create a sense of urgency without completely revealing our absolute maximum. The word ""potentially"" leaves a tiny bit of room to move if needed. 
* **Keep it amicable:** We want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
