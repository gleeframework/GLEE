"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response! I understand your budget concerns, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we settle at $100? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer, and I'm confident it's a price that represents the true value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $60 and $100, which would be $80. Can you consider that?",80.0,Bob,4,
