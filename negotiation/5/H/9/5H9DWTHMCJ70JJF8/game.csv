"Hi Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is close, but I need to get at least $14,500 for this to make sense for me. This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
