"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $11,000.  This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for me to come down a bit if necessary. I'm confident that I can get closer to my minimum price of $10,000 within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I have 8 rounds left, so I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,500. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum price.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting very close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get that extra $200 to reach my desired price point. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for that last bit of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $10,200. This is a small compromise, only $200 less than my previous offer. I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still determined to get as close to my minimum price as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, the negotiations are taking longer than I expected.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm worried I won't be able to get to my desired price point.  Selling to John will secure me a good price, and I can always try to negotiate with Bob again in the future."
