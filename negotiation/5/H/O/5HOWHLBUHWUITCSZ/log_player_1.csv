Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's of significant value and would be a great asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. His response will give you valuable information for further negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
