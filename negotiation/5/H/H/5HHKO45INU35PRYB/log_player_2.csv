{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is way above that. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it sets the negotiation in motion and gives Bob some room to maneuver."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. Even though it's closer, Bob should still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still several rounds left, so there's time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a compromise. It's higher than his initial offer but still lower than Alice's latest price. This shows that he's willing to negotiate but still wants to save as much money as possible."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it is still above his limit.  Bob has already made significant progress in the negotiation and should continue trying to get a better deal.  There are still several rounds remaining, and he could potentially get a price closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Bob's final counteroffer is $1,200,000, which is his maximum budget. If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product at his desired price. If she rejects, he can still buy the product from John for the same price. This is a good strategy because it puts the pressure on Alice and ensures Bob gets the product for the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his maximum budget, and Alice is still unwilling to budge.  The offer from John guarantees Bob the product for his price limit.  It is time to secure the deal."
