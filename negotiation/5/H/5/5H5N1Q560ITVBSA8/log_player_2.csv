"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have John as a backup option for $1,500,000.  Alice is clearly bluffing about selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000 (as that's less than its value to her).  By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away, which might make her propose a better deal."
