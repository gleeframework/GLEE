"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  how about $950000? This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and it's a fair price given the product's value to you. Let's keep the negotiation going!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I see we're getting closer. While I can't go as low as $850000, I'm willing to offer the product for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
