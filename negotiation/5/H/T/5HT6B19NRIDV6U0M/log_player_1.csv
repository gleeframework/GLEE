Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm also leaving room for negotiation, knowing that I can always accept a lower price or sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still lower than my minimum desired value of $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm looking for $10,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and I think it's fair for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum desired value. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can't get a better price from Bob, and selling to John would result in the same profit."
