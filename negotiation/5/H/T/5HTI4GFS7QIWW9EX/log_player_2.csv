{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,000,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $850000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My revised offer is $950000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.
* There are still multiple rounds left, and it's worth continuing to negotiate.
* You're still closer to your goal with each round, and you have the option to buy from John as a fallback if negotiations fail."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $900,000, which is closer to my budget and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $980000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still too high, even after several rounds of negotiation.
* You've reached a point where further negotiations might not yield a significant price reduction. 
*  Since John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, it's a better deal than accepting Alice's offer.  It's more prudent to secure the product at a lower price from John and avoid further haggling."
