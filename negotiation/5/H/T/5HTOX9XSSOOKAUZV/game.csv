"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great value from the product.",102.5,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
