Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $90.  While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get a great value from the product."", ""product_price"": 102.50}

I'm still holding out for a better price. $95 is closer to my minimum but I can still try to negotiate a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
