"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your budgetary concerns. I am willing to consider your offer. For $90, I am happy to sell the product to you. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still a bit short on budget, and $90 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal work.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad you're still interested in the product. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $87 as the price for the product?

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $87 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $82?
