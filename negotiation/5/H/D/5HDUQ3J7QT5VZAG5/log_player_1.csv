{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's above Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and emphasize the value of the product to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum valuation, it's still better than nothing.  However, I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  I'll aim for a middle ground and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110,  which is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
