"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but Alice is asking for $950,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffers are possible:**  The prompt allows for counteroffers. This means you can potentially get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, you have the option to buy from John. 

By rejecting the offer, you open the door for a potential better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects the value to me and still leaves you a good profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit (as her minimum acceptable price is $800,000).
* **Highlights value and profit:** The message emphasizes the value to Bob while also mentioning the profit margin for Alice, attempting to frame the offer as a win-win.
* **Opens the door to further negotiation:**  This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation. If Alice rejects, Bob can adjust his counteroffer further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your desired price:**  While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $900,000 is still higher than your target of $1,000,000. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** You have a significant buffer between Alice's offer and your maximum price, which allows for further negotiation and potential for a better deal.
* **John is still a viable option:**  If negotiations with Alice fail, buying from John remains a fallback option, although it's not ideal.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a price closer to your goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget.
