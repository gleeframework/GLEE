"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects the value to me and still leaves you a good profit margin. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in your product, $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied with this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
