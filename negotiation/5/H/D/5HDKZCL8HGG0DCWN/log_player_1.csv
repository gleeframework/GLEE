Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $850,000. This price reflects the value to me and still leaves you a good profit margin. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
