"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You value the product at $150 and Alice is offering it for $135. While this is a good price, you can potentially get it for less by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $120, so offering $125 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This shows that you're serious about buying the product, but also that you're willing to negotiate. There's still room for Alice to make a profit, and it leaves a small buffer in case Alice needs to lower the price slightly to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to your initial value, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. It's worth continuing to negotiate, as there's still room for both parties to reach an agreement that's beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $135 to $140, showing she's willing to negotiate. We've already offered $125, so increasing to $130 shows a willingness to compromise without going over our maximum value. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has risen to $145, which is getting closer to your maximum value of $150.  While you could continue negotiating, the potential savings are shrinking. Buying from John for $150 guarantees you get the product and avoids further rounds of back-and-forth. It's a more efficient decision than risking another round of negotiation that might not result in a lower price."
