"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters, but also demonstrates my confidence in the value of what I'm selling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm confident I can counteroffer and secure a deal closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with my counteroffer. $10,500 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintains a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,500 is a good compromise.  It's significantly more than what I'd get from John and it's getting closer to my ideal price. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely, so it's best to secure this deal now."
