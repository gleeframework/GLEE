"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $950,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000, making it a compelling starting point for negotiation. While it's a bold move, it demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of getting the best possible price while still being within his budget. This counteroffer is a modest increase from his previous offer, signaling his willingness to negotiate but also showing he's not willing to pay Alice's asking price.  It's a good tactic to slowly inch closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $1 million.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue exploring if he can secure a price closer to his goal.  There are still several rounds left, and Bob can continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows a strong commitment to closing the deal while staying within his budget.  Since there are still four rounds remaining, Bob has some leverage to potentially close the deal at this price. If Alice rejects, she risks losing the deal entirely, as Bob can always buy from John."
