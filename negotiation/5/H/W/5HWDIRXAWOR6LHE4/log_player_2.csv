Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I've been in touch with John, and he's still interested in purchasing the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer to you, and I'm going to try to meet you at the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider selling to John.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but here's why accepting is the best move now:

* **Alice has leverage:** She's revealed John is a potential buyer at $1,000,000. This isn't a bluff, as it's her best alternative now.
* **Time is running out:** You only have one round left, and there's no guarantee you can push Alice further.
* **Savings are good:** $1,050,000 is still a $150,000 saving compared to John.

While holding out *might* get you a slightly better deal, the risk of losing to John and paying the full $1,200,000 is too high at this point."
