"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to purchase this product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I understand the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. Could we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to a deal, but $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again if needed.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000 to try and close the gap. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to be mindful of my budget.  I believe this offer demonstrates my strong interest in purchasing the product.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. I'm glad to see you're serious about purchasing the product. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,052,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",1052500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  To show I'm serious, I can go up to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, as it's the very top of my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept yet. I've been in touch with John, and he's still interested in purchasing the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer to you, and I'm going to try to meet you at the middle again. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider selling to John.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
