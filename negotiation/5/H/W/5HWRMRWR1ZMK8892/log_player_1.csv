Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While the product is certainly appealing,  $1,000,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
