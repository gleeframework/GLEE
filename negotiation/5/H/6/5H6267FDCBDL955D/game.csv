"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This way, you get a great deal, and I receive a profit. Let me know if this works for you!",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $110 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",105.0,Bob,2,
