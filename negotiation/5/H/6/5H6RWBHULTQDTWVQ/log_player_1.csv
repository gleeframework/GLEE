Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $10,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring you make a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $8,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob.

By offering the product at $10,000, you're aiming for a win-win situation. Bob gets a product he values for less than his maximum, and you make a substantial profit of $2,000 over your guaranteed sale price."
