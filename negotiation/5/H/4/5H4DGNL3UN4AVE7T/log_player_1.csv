Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but doesn't leave too much on the table for him. 
* **It's below my minimum:** I still have room to negotiate down if Bob makes a lower counteroffer.
* **It leaves room for John:** If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate it, I'm not quite ready to pay $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob or by selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750. This price is still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
