I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd sell to John, hoping to get a good deal from Bob.  If he rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $150. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to try to meet Bob halfway, but still remaining above my minimum selling price. If he rejects this, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum selling price. While I'd prefer to sell to him,  it's not worth continuing to negotiate and risk losing the deal with John.  I'm going to sell to John for $150."
