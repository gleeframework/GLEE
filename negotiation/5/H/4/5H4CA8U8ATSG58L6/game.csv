"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $18000. I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. Can you meet me in the middle at $15500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $17000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a solution.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $14500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $16000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but I think I can do even better than that. Can you meet me at $13800?",13800.0,Bob,6,
