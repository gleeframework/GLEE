"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I cannot disclose the specific nature of the product, I can assure you it is worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000, a price that reflects its potential. This is a one-time opportunity, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than what you are willing to pay ($1,200,000). Although she claims the product is worth more to her, that information isn't relevant to your decision. You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
