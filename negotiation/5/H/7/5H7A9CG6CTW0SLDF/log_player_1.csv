"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe that $10,000 is a fair price for the product. I hope we can reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000 and  further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
