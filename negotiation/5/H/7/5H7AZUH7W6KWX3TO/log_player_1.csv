"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest.  I believe he may be willing to pay closer to my value if we negotiate effectively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $950,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer and a step closer to Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can reach a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer will secure a sale and prevent me from potentially losing out to John."
