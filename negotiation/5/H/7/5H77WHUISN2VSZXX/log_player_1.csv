Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as justified by the product's value, making it more palatable to Bob.

By starting high but reasonable, I increase my chances of securing a deal that yields the highest possible return."
