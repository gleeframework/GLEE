"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, at $18,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a price that's mutually acceptable while still getting close to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by playing a risky game of counter-offers. It's better to secure the sale now and get the $15,000."
