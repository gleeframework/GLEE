Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm not going for the full $120 (the difference between what it's worth to you and me) because I want to leave room for a counteroffer from Bob. This will keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a higher price for me. 
* **Positivity:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $90 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my desired range, so I'm confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation,  $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  This would be a fair price that allows me to cover my costs and still be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum of $100.
* **Positive Language:** I'm reaffirming my willingness to negotiate and framing the price as fair.
* **Focused on Value:** I'm highlighting my costs to justify my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I believe $90 is still a reasonable price for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my minimum price of $100.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'm accepting his offer, I can still potentially use this as leverage to increase the price further if John's offer changes in the future.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer is a safe choice as it guarantees a sale.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting now avoids further rounds of negotiation."
