"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This reflects the value I place on the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to go that low.  I'll counter with a price that's closer to my previous offer, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm sticking to my offer of $13,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I would prefer to close the deal with Bob, I've reached my limit on how low I'm willing to go.  It's better to secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement than to continue negotiating and risk losing the deal altogether."
