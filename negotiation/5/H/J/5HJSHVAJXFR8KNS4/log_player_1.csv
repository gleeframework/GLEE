Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for the highest price Bob might accept maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high but below Bob's perceived value ($12,000) allows room for him to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John provides a safety net, allowing you to be bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
