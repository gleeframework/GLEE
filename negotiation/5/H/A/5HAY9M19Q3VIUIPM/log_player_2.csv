Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you think it's worth something to you. However, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering what you're willing to pay and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think?

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm afraid $975,000 is still a bit short of my minimum price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to make one final offer to you. I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my absolute final price, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

Alice is holding firm and this offer is close enough to my desired price point. It's better to accept a slightly lower profit margin than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
