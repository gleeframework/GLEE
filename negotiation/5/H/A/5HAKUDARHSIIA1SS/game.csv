"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $9,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'll meet you at $9,500. That's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",9500.0,Alice,5,
