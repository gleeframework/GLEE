{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is  higher than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000) but lower than the value Bob places on the product ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000 for the product. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000).  It's not worth selling to him at that price. I will make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about $12,500?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $11500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it's clear that Bob is not willing to meet my price.  Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option to ensure I meet my minimum value."
