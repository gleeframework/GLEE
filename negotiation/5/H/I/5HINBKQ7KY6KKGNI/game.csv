"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is very competitive. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider  $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $9,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. I think this is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $8,500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
