Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a fair price, but I'm not willing to go above $120.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit closer to your original price, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $122.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is consistently moving towards a price that's favorable for me. Accepting $122.50 ensures a good profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away or me having to settle for John's $100 offer."
