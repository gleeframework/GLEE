"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product is around $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I'm still not quite at that price point. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the unique features of this product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",9250.0,Bob,4,
