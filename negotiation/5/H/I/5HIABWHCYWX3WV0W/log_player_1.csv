Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being too aggressive, allowing for a back and forth. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again.
* If the negotiation drags on or becomes unfavorable, I'll keep John in mind as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product is around $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** $9,000 is above my minimum of $12,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  There's still room to negotiate. Bob has acknowledged the value is higher than $8,000, indicating he might be willing to pay more.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting allows me to see how committed Bob is and how much he's willing to budge. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $10,000,  still leaving room for compromise but moving closer to my desired price. 
* If Bob becomes too stubborn or unwilling to negotiate, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the market value, I'm still not quite at that price point. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price considering the unique features of this product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Profitable:** $9,500 is still above my minimum and allows for potential profit.
* **Positive Language:** The message emphasizes a fair deal and mutual benefit, fostering a collaborative atmosphere.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, fantastic! We have a deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and my options (sell to John or counteroffer again).
* I'm keeping in mind that I can always go to John if things get too complicated or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $9,250 is only $250 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and the gap is shrinking.  It's possible Bob won't budge further.
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, accepting now avoids potential further delays and a possible stalemate with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and move on.
* I'll make a note to be more assertive in my initial offer in future negotiations to avoid lengthy negotiations."
