"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm.  $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $150.  What do you think?",150.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll still get a fantastic deal.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $165 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'm sticking with my original offer of $150. If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with another option.",150.0,Bob,4,
