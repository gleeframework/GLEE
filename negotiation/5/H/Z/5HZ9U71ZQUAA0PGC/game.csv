"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price. Can you consider my offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This price is still very favorable for you considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $962,500. This price should be more acceptable to both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",962500.0,Bob,4,
