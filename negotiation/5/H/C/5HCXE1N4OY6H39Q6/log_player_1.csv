"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets the tone for a potentially profitable deal. By stating the product is ""great"", it implies value and encourages Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about $90?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth it."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $85, which is only $5 less than my initial counteroffer of $90.  It's a good compromise and allows me to close the deal without risking losing too much, especially considering I can always sell to John for $80."
