Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to get a price closer to $700,000, but I'm willing to go higher if necessary."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $750,000, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still hoping to find a middle ground. This is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is getting closer to my goal, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push for a lower price, especially considering Alice has been rejecting my offers so far."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $800,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable compromise considering Alice's latest offer of $825,000.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but her offers are slowly getting closer to my target price.  At this point, accepting her offer for $815,000 is the best option.  This price saves me a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and we're nearing the end of our rounds. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and having to buy from John at a much higher price."
