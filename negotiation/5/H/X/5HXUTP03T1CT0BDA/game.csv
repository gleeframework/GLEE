"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $2,000,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than I'm able to pay right now. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the potential benefits I see in this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. This product represents a significant investment, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
