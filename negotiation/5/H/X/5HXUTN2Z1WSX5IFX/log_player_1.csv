Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I know it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $1,250,000, but am open to discussing a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we have leverage since we have another buyer (John) at $1,500,000. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that there's flexibility in the price. 
* **Targeting Above Bob's Valuation:** The $1,250,000 asking price aims for a win-win. It's above Bob's perceived value, but potentially appealing if he believes the product will bring him significant returns.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** This strategy assumes Bob is open to negotiation. If we knew he was very price-sensitive or unlikely to budge, a different approach might be needed.
* **Relationship Building:** The message aims to be polite and positive, fostering a good relationship with Bob even if he doesn't accept this initial offer."
