Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so this price leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** Your minimum is $1,500,000, so you have some wiggle room to go lower if needed.
* **It's a ""round"" number:** This makes it easier for Bob to process and potentially counteroffer.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you leave room to negotiate and potentially still get a favorable deal.  If Bob rejects, you can then decide if you want to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I'm going to counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our ongoing negotiations, I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This price still provides a good value for you and allows us to come closer to a mutually agreeable solution.  Let's keep working towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider a price of $1,425,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value you see in the product and my budget constraints. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still a bit below my ideal, I'm willing to accept it considering that I have a backup buyer (John) who's willing to pay my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing both Bob and John."
