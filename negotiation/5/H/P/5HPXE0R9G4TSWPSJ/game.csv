"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, which would be $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
