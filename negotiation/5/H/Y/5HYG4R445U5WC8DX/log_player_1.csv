"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's estimated value, but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to accept, but also allows for a potential counter-offer from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I will counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as it's below his estimated value, but it brings us closer to my desired price.  I believe this will incentivize him to accept, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to the price John is offering, I am still hoping to get a better deal from Bob. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,350,000. This is a compromise to show Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but it still leaves room for some profit beyond John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation with Bob has gone on for a while, and his offers aren't getting any higher.  Given that John is offering a price that's only slightly lower than Bob's current offer, it makes sense to sell to John. This ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at a reasonable price."
