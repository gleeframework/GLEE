Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special discounted price of $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, even considering this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Close to Bob's Valuation:** While $14,000 is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it's close enough that he might consider it if he believes the product will provide him with additional value or utility that he hasn't factored in.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This gives you leverage in the negotiation, allowing you to confidently hold on to a higher price.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters with a lower price. You can gradually decrease your asking price, but always keep your minimum ($15,000) in mind."
