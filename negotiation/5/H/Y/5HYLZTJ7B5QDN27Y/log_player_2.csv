"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. It's likely Alice is aiming for a quick sale at a lower price, but it's worth trying to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit low for me considering the product's value.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,350,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still a bit below the value I was hoping to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still lower than the product's value to her ($1,500,000), but it's significantly closer to my maximum price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation might save a bit more, but it's risky.  If I reject this offer, Alice could counteroffer at a higher price, and I might end up paying more than I would if I accepted this offer. 

It's a good deal considering that I can get the product for $100,000 less than John's offer.  It's worth accepting to secure the product and avoid further potential price increases."
