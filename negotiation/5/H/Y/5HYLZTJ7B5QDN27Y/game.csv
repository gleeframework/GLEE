"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit low for me considering the product's value.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,350,000 is a significant investment for you, but I'm still a bit below the value I was hoping to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to revisiting if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
