Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and how much he values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go that low. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are still too low, and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation."
