""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."",

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
