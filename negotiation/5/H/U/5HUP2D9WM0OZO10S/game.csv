"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider $92? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90 to $100, but I'd like to get a better deal than that.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $98? This is a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the outcome. Let me know what you think.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm getting close to my target price, and I think we can meet in the middle from here.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $96. This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you say?",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'd like to try to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to pay $94 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",94.0,Bob,8,
