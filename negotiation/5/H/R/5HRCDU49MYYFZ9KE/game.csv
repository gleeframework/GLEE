"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $90 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $82.50. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $78. Let's try to find a middle ground here.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $81. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",81.0,Alice,5,
