"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000. It's still a great price for you, considering the value you place on the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000. How about we try $1,075,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
