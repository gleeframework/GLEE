It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be open to $120? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 135. It's a fair compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

While $135 is closer to my limit, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'll try one more counteroffer before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I think 132 is a sweet spot that still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account your budget concerns. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $132 is getting very close to my counteroffer of $130. At this point, it's likely that we'll just go back and forth with smaller and smaller price changes. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product, rather than risk her getting more stubborn and going back to her initial price."
