"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $11,000?  This is still a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However,  $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable.  Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so I'll offer $10,250. Can we meet in the middle this time?",10250.0,Bob,6,
