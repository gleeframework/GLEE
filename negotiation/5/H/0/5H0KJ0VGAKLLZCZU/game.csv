"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still provides you with a significant value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
