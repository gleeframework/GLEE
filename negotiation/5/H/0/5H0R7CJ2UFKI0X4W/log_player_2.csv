"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's in my best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a good value considering its potential.  I'm open to further discussion if this offer isn't acceptable."", ""product_price"": 700000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $900,000? This reflects some flexibility on my part while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has shown some flexibility, $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to continue negotiating.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
