"Hi Bob, I'm excited to be discussing the sale of this product with you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is still a good value considering its potential.  I'm open to further discussion if this offer isn't acceptable.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle on $900,000? This reflects some flexibility on my part while still recognizing the product's worth.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which is a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",850000.0,Bob,4,
