"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, given its value. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can't quite meet you at $9,000, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product within your budget and me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,750 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 still isn't quite there for me. How about we split the difference this time? $9,750 would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get the product at a great price and me to earn a respectable profit. It's a win-win for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,7,
