"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to meet you at $95, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $102.50 is the best price for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $97.50, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $101? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a compromise.",101.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Alice, but I'm still not ready to commit to $101. I'd be willing to meet you at $99, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",99.0,Bob,8,
