Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate. It also signals to Bob that I believe the product is valuable and I'm confident in its worth. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $750,000,  I can do better than that. I'm confident in the product's value and am willing to negotiate further. 

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I see in the product. I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough to Bob while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal! While it's only slightly higher than what John would pay, it's worth it to avoid the risk of a further negotiation with Bob.  There's no guarantee that we could get a better offer from Bob in the next round, and it's a risk to potentially lose out on a sale altogether. 

Let's accept Bob's offer and secure the sale!"
