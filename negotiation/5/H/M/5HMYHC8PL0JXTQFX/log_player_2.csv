Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob. I appreciate your enthusiasm, and I'm happy to meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.

This is a tough one, but it's time to accept. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she won't budge much from $1,050,000. 
* **Time is running out:**  You have fewer rounds to negotiate, increasing the risk of reaching an impasse.
* **Savings are good:** While not ideal, $1,050,000 is significantly less than John's $1,500,000 price. 

It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
