"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to me and the opportunity for Bob to get a good deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While I'm aiming for as much as possible, I'm not starting at a completely unreasonable price that would immediately shut down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation is possible:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **John is a backup option:**  While John is a secure alternative, I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing this as a fair price for both parties.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that my counteroffer is reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $125. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss.
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is showing willingness to compromise, so there's potential for a deal closer to my desired price.
* **John remains a strong alternative:** John's offer of $150 is still appealing, but I'm determined to get a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $130 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $140.  I'm really motivated to make this deal work, and I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Expressing motivation:** I'm emphasizing my desire to reach an agreement to encourage Bob to compromise.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're motivated to make a deal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $140, which would be $135. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a lower price, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further.
* **John provides a safe alternative:** John is ready to buy the product at my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John ensures a profitable outcome and minimizes the risk of further negotiation. 

Given the limited number of rounds and the risk of accepting a price below my minimum, selling to John is the best strategy at this point."
