"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you've put into this product, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it but would need to bring the price down to $10000 to make it work for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,000 is significantly below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $13,000?  This gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11500. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but how about $12,500?  I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and your budget. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is the absolute highest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob.  Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
