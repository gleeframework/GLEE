"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering my needs and the potential of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and acknowledges the value you see in it.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs and the product's potential.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering our respective needs and the product's potential. Let's close this deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
