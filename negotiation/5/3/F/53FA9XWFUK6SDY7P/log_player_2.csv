"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth starting the negotiation by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering my needs and the potential of the product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my initial offer and acknowledges the value you see in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  We need to keep pushing for a lower price.  The risk of going to John is present, but it's still better to see if we can get a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still outside my range. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective needs and the product's potential.  Let's find a way to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not satisfied.  I believe we can reach a better price, especially since she's mentioning a ""final offer"" and other interested buyers. This could be a tactic to pressure me. I'm going to try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my limit.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering our respective needs and the product's potential. Let's close this deal.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to seriously consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
