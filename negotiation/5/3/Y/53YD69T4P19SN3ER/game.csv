"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I understand you have a budget, $9500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9750.  This would allow both of us to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9750. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9500 again? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
