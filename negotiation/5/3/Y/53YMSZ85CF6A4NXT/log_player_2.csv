Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.
