"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about we start with $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still only comfortable spending $80.  I'm sure you'll be able to sell it for more, so hopefully, you'll consider it.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your limit, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $110. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",110.0,Alice,5,
