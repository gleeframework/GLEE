Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still allows room for negotiation. It also signals that I believe the product is valuable and worth a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price of $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still believe the product holds value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as his previous offer, and since I'm confident the product won't sell for more, I'm accepting to avoid further negotiation and finalize the sale."
