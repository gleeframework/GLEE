Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. It's a great opportunity, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight that the product is worth a lot to me, implying it might be even more valuable to Bob. This creates a sense of urgency and potential scarcity.
* **Confidence:** By saying ""I'm confident you won't regret it,"" I'm trying to subtly increase the perceived value of the product in Bob's mind.
* **Plan B:**  I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at $15,000, allowing me to take a risk with this offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John and sell the product for $15,000."
