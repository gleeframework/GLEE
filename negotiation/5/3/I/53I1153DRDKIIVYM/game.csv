"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to you.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000, but that's my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can meet in the middle.",975000.0,Bob,6,
