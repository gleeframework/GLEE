"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10,000. I understand that it's a bit lower than what I initially offered, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also takes into account your budget concerns. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  Could you do $11,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,5,
