"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to negotiate.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would allow us both to make a profitable deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,115,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1115000.0,Alice,7,
