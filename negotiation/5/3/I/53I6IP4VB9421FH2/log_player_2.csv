"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above your desired price range. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to Bob's desired price range, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still above his ideal target. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and Bob can continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and see if he can push Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $1,125,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would allow us both to make a profitable deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,115,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,115,000 is getting very close to Bob's desired price range, and she has stated this is her final offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product at a price that is reasonably close to Bob's target."
