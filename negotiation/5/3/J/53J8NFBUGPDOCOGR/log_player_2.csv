"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, I assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair for both of us.  Please consider my offer of $1500000. It's a substantial investment, but I'm confident you'll find the potential return more than worthwhile. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While she claims the product is worth that much to her, it doesn't guarantee it's actually worth that much to you. It's better to reject the offer and explore other options. You can always negotiate with Alice further or choose the guaranteed price from John."
