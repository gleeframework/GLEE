Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant premium to my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of the value I place on the product.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to engage in the negotiation."
