Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's true worth. What do you think?

{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000.  This is a strong offer considering I can buy it for $1,000,000 elsewhere. Let me know if you're open to this."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to bridge the gap. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has indicated this is her final offer and she's unlikely to move much closer to $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse outcome. Buying from John guarantees the best price."
