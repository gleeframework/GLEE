"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I still think there's some room to meet in the middle. Would you be willing to accept $925,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value to both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's true worth. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $950,000.  This is a strong offer considering I can buy it for $1,000,000 elsewhere. Let me know if you're open to this.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to bridge the gap. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.
