"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product.  Given its value to you, I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be fair for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob.  He values the product at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is tempting, I need to consider my own costs and the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise that we can both be happy with.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price, but still above his target. He can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  Since he has 10 rounds, he has time to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a better price. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $937,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's seal the deal, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $937,500 is getting close to Bob's target price, and he's only got 5 rounds left. He's already rejected a couple of offers and doesn't want to risk Alice walking away or ending up having to buy from John at a higher price.  This is a good deal for Bob, even if he doesn't get his absolute best price."
