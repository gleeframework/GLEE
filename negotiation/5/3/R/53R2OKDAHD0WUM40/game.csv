"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $900,000 is tempting, I need to consider my own costs and the value of the product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair compromise that we can both be happy with. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a better price. I'm willing to offer $925,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $937,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's seal the deal, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",937500.0,Alice,5,
