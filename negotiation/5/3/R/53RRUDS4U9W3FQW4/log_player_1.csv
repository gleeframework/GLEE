Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's an offer that aims to maximize your profit, while keeping Bob's valuation in mind:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see great value in.  Given its unique nature, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, allowing you to benefit significantly while reflecting the value it holds.  Please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000. Offering it slightly below this price ($1,450,000) makes it highly appealing to him.
* **Maximizing Profit:** This price is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and secures you a substantial profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong opening offer, the message leaves space for Bob to counter-propose if he wishes.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you had more information, you might adjust the offer accordingly."
