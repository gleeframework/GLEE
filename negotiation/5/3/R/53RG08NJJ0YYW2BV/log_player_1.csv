Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is more than your $10,000 minimum.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a concrete price, you demonstrate your willingness to negotiate."
