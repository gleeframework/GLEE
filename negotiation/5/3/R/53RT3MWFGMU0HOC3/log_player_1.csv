{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. By giving a specific price, it gives Bob a clear idea of what you're looking for and avoids any ambiguity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price point.  I will counter with a lower price but still aim to close a deal above $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell for $10,750. This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I really like this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I am tempted by the $9,000 offer, it's still below my minimum price point. I will attempt one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If Bob rejects again, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800 as my final offer. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}
