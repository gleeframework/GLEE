"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there yet.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to sell for $10,750. This would be a great deal for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay. I really like this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $9,800 as my final offer. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,5,
