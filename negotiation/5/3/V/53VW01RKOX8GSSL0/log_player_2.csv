I trust this proposal aligns well with your interests and financial considerations. Should you require any further information or have questions about the product, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working together.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation."
