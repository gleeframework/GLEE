"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're interested, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95?  I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to go a little higher."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a good compromise. It's a fair price for both of us, and it avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal altogether."
