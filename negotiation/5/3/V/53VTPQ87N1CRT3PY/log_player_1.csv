"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures that Bob has some incentive to accept. I'm also emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $9500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I can still try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can go down to $9,750.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to find a price that's acceptable to both of us before I have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I would like to counter with $9600 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept** Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $12,000 and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
