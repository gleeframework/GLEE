"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at no less than $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $2000000.  I believe it holds significant potential for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Considering its value to you and my own budget constraints, I'd like to offer $1200000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further negotiation.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't go that low.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1700000.  This price still reflects the product's true worth, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1700000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably commit to at this time.  To move forward, I'm willing to offer $1400000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given both our needs.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still slightly below my minimum.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1550000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial price for this unique product. What are your thoughts?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
