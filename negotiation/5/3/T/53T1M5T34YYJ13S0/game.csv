"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,750 is still too low. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,125. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement.",10125.0,Alice,5,
