"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,750 is still too low. Let's split the difference and settle on $10,125. This is a good compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at $10,000 than to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially end up paying more."
