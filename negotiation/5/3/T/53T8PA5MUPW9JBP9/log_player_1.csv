Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than you realize. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob only values the product at $800,000, Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. Therefore, Alice should aim for the highest possible price with Bob. 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay the full $1,000,000 if he sees enough value or is in a position where acquiring the product is crucial.
* **No Risk of Losing Money:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out. She can sell it to John at her desired price. 

This approach is about maximizing Alice's potential gain without risking the guaranteed sale."
