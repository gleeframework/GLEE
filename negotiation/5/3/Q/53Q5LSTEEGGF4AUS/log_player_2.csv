"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a good fallback option with John, so you're not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum threshold of $10,000.  You can likely negotiate further, or simply buy from John for a guaranteed price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $11750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.  Since you have a guaranteed price of $10,000 from John, it's time to cut your losses and buy from him.  There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice, and continuing the negotiation might waste valuable time and effort."
