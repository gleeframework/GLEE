``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives me room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.

I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $88, which is closer to my budget and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $88 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than I'd like.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $88 is still just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would give you a great deal and would be more in line with what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 90}
