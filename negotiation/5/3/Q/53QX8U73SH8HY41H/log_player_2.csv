# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a clear goal of spending no more than $80, and Alice's offer is above that."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.50 is closer to your goal, it's still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating for a price closer to $80."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $88, which is closer to my budget and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit, but $88 is still just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? This would give you a great deal and would be more in line with what I'm looking for. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $90 is still above your budget of $80.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and guarantee the product for your desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice risks exceeding your budget and losing the chance to get the product for $80."
