"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly below what I need for this product. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $7,750? It's a compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference and go with $8,250. That way, we both get a good deal. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  I'd be willing to do $8,000 even though that's a little higher than I wanted to go.  It seems like that's a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,6,
