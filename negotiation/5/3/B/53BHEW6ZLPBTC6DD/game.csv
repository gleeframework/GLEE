"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm offering the product to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850000 to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. I'm offering the product to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $875000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
