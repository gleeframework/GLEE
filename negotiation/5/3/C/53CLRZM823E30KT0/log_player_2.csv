"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant investment for you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects the value it brings and allows for a healthy return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more money by counter-offering. There's a significant gap between Alice's valuation ($1,000,000) and her offer ($1,400,000), indicating room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm prepared to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a substantial margin for profit while allowing me to recoup a significant portion of the value I place on this product. Let's find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position to negotiate further. While Alice's counteroffer is closer to his target, there's still room for a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a price closer to $1,200,000."
