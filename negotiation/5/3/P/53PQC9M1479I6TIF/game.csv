"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $95?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to offer it to you for $102.50. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",102.5,Alice,5,
