"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference from our last offers and agree on $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us.",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $102.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115 again, as I mentioned earlier. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,7,
