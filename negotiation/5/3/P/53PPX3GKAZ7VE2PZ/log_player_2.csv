"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $150 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80. It's best to reject this offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is still above my maximum budget of $80. While it's a step closer, it's still not a good deal for me. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my preferred price point, $110 is still outside of my budget of $80. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price, so I'll reject this offer and continue bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here.  $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference from our last offers and agree on $102.50.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $102.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115 again, as I mentioned earlier. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $115, and I'm not willing to pay that much.  I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80.  While I'd prefer to get it even cheaper, it's important to be realistic about my time and effort.  John's offer is within my budget and a better deal than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
