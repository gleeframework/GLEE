"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price of $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a great deal for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  It's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,750.  How about we compromise at $10,250? It's closer to your price, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,250 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $9,900? It's a reasonable compromise and a good price for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this negotiation.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,000.  However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  Could you go down to $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would make this deal work for me.",9500.0,Bob,8,
