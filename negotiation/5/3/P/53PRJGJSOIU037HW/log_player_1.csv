Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers, while also potentially securing a good deal for myself.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold. While I could accept it and get something, it's less than what I'd get from John. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. How about $10,500? That's still a good deal for you and closer to what I need to get for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $10,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's final offer is exactly what I'd get from John.  I'm happy to accept and avoid the hassle of further negotiation."
