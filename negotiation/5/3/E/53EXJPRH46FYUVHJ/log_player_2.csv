"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I think $9,500 is a fair price, considering its potential worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  I'm confident this product is worth that much to me, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than $9,500, it's still not within Bob's ideal price range.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I'm happy to keep negotiating, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me right now.  How about we settle at $8,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would allow me to move forward with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 8750}
