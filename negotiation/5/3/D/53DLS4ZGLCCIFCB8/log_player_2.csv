# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $850,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a good value for the product. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000, and you can get the product for $800,000 from John. It makes more sense to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John to secure the best price."
