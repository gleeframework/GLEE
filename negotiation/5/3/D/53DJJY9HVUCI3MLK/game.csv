"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you as well. Let's close this deal!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
