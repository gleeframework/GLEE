"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. Is this something you'd be interested in?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It sounds like a great product. However, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $125. Would you be willing to consider that?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $112.50. I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher price, $122.50. It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",122.5,Alice,5,
