"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This reflects the true worth while leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our negotiation so far.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I value your interest, and to demonstrate my willingness to close this deal, I'll come down slightly. How about $1,275,000?  This recognizes the product's worth while offering you a good deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer. How about $1,225,000? I think this is a fair price considering our negotiation so far.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end.  While I believe this product is worth even more, I'm willing to accept $1,250,000, my previous offer,  to close this deal today. This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
