"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its exceptional value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You have a ceiling of $1,000,000 and she's already at $900,000. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **You have no information about Alice's minimum price.**  It's worth seeing if you can get a lower price.
* **John is a safety net.** You can always buy from John if you can't get a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you can explore if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. This product does sound intriguing, but I'm hoping to find a price closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unrealistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the realm of possibility.  
* **Shows interest:**  It demonstrates your interest in the product while also making it clear you're looking for a better deal. 
* **Opens the door to negotiation:** This counteroffer sets the stage for back-and-forth negotiation.  You're likely to be met with a counter-counteroffer, giving you a chance to refine your strategy."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $850000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your target:**  Her counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant compromise from her initial $900,000.
* **The risk of further negotiation is high:**  While you could try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. You might end up stuck buying from John at a higher price.
* **It's a good deal:** $850,000 is within your budget and represents a substantial savings compared to buying from John. 

It's a good time to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with, rather than risking a breakdown in negotiations."
