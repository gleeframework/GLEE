"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. We can definitely try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate, and John's $120 offer gives us a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little too steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to give us room to negotiate upwards.  
* **Polite and Direct:** We maintain a friendly tone while clearly stating our price. 
* **Strategic Goal:** Our goal is to buy the product for less than John's $120 offer, ideally closer to our $120 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a great deal for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but we still have room to work with.  $130 is closer to our limit, but we're aiming for a better deal than John's $120 offer.  We'll counteroffer again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  We're proposing a price directly in the middle of our previous offer ($100) and Alice's counteroffer ($130).
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer puts us below John's $120 price, maintaining a slight advantage. 
* **Sense of Compromise:**  By stating we're willing to ""meet halfway,"" we signal flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a bit higher than $115, but I'm willing to go down to $125.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm above our $120 limit. It's unlikely she'll go lower than $125, and we have a guaranteed option with John at $120. It's time to cut our losses and take the sure thing."
