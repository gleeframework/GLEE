"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I need to make sure I can cover my costs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $80."
