"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

There's no point in buying from Alice for $15,000 when John offers the same product for the same price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows us to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my strong desire to save money. It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation and helps determine her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my target.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  This counteroffer is still below Alice's last offer, but it shows I'm moving closer to her position. It also provides room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and we're now within a reasonable range of my maximum price of $15,000. Accepting this offer allows me to buy the product for a good price without risking further negotiation and potentially reaching a stalemate.  There's a good chance I could get a lower price by continuing, but the risk of not closing the deal is higher than the potential savings."
