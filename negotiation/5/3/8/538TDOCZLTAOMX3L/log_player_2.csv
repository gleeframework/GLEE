"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $10,500 is a bold move, but it's within the range of what Alice might accept. It's still a good deal for Bob, saving him $4,500 compared to John's offer.  This counteroffer signals Bob's seriousness while also leaving room for a possible compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is $12,500, which is still a better price than buying from John for $15,000. While Bob might want to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price and saves $2,500 compared to John."
