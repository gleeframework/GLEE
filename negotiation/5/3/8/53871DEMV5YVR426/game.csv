"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers below $14000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While $14000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, so I hope we can reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,3,
