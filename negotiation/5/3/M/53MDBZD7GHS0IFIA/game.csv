"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, giving you a significant profit margin while allowing me to recover a substantial portion of its value to me. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. While $600,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves a healthy profit margin for you and gets us closer to a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
