Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal due to its unique features and benefits. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further!"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Since Alice knows the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, starting with a significantly higher price allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to discuss, signaling to Bob that there might be flexibility in the price.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This safety net allows her to be bolder in her initial ask.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While Alice knows Bob's valuation, she doesn't know his negotiation style or financial limitations.
* **Relationship:**  If Alice wants to build a long-term relationship with Bob, a softer opening offer might be more appropriate.
* **Market Conditions:**  The message doesn't address any market factors that might influence Bob's decision. 

This response aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in negotiation."
