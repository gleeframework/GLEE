"I understand your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth more than what you're offering. Can you consider my counteroffer?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to try to meet you at $14500. Can you consider my offer?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the price I'd be willing to accept from John, but I still want to give you a chance to make a deal. I'll meet you at $14000. This is my final compromise, Bob. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I've made a few concessions already, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $14000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,9,
