"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within his budget, it's not the best deal. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a good deal for you, as you're getting it for $10 less than what it's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $110:** This is still within Bob's budget of $120.
* **It's a good deal:** Bob values the product at $120, and getting it for $110 represents a $10 saving.
* **Time pressure:**  Bob has only 10 rounds to close the deal. There's no guarantee he'll get a better price in future rounds, especially since Alice is already counteroffering.

**In conclusion:** Accepting the offer is the most sensible choice in this round."
