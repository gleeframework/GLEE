"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a good deal for you, as you're getting it for $10 less than what it's worth to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
