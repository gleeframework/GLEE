Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $110? That's still a good deal for you, as you're getting it for $10 less than what it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
