"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me considering the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,250 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
