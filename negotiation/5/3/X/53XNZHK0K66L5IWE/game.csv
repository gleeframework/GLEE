"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $16000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit more and offer the product for $14500. This is a fair price, and it's the lowest I can go. Let me know if you're interested.",14500.0,Alice,5,
