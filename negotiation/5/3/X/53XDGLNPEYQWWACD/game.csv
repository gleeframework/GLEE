"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but $900000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $825000? It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm thinking more along the lines of $725000. Can you consider that?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $725000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we meet in the middle again? I'll offer it to you for $775000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",775000.0,Alice,5,
