{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still making a profit above your $1,000,000 floor.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is likely to counter, and you have space to bargain.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:** It's not too aggressive, showing that you're open to a deal. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also be mindful of the risk of Bob walking away and potentially you having to settle with John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above John's offer, it's still significantly lower than your desired price. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting his offer keeps the possibility of a higher price alive.  

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider these factors:

* **Your desired price:** Aim for a number that's closer to your ideal price point.
* **Bob's counteroffer:** He's willing to go up from $1,000,000.
* **Risk:**  Weigh the possibility of Bob walking away against the chance of a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good price, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer finds a middle ground between your previous offer ($1,150,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining profit:** This price still gives you a profit above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Openness to further negotiation:**  By using language like ""meet in the middle"", you keep the door open for further negotiation if needed.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $1,075,000. Would you be willing to come down a little more? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit too low.  You're only $25,000 away from your minimum price, and with a bit more negotiation, you might be able to close the gap further.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider these factors:

* **Your desired price:** Aim for a number that's closer to your ideal price point (which should be above $1,075,000).
* **Bob's counteroffer:** He's willing to go up from $1,050,000.
* **Risk:** Weigh the possibility of Bob walking away against the chance of a better deal. 

You're getting close to your minimum, so consider if the potential for a higher offer is worth the risk of Bob walking away and forcing you to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to work with you.  I can't go as low as $1,075,000, but I'm prepared to come down to $1,090,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,075,000). It shows a continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above minimum:** This price is still above your minimum of $1,000,000, ensuring you get a profit.
* **Balancing risk:** You're taking a small risk by coming down further, but it's a calculated move. If Bob accepts, you'll earn more than John's offer, and if he rejects, you can still consider accepting John's offer.

This counteroffer attempts to close the gap while maintaining a strong position."
