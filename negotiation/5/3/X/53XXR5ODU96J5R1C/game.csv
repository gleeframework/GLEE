"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset for me. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
