# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset for me. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. While you could continue negotiating, you've already had several rounds and it's unclear if you'll be able to get her down to your price.  Buying from John guarantees you the product within your budget."
