"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you sharing the value to you. While I recognize its potential,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product, considering my budget and the potential for negotiation.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it can bring to you. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still outside of my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1100000.  This is a fair price considering the potential of the product and my budget limitations. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
