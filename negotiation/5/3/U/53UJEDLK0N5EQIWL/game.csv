"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to both of us, so let's find a price that works. I'm starting with $1,750,000.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a lot to both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's work together to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a good deal.  While I value your business, $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000.  This price is fair to both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would give you the full value you've stated for the product. Let's close this deal at this fair price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
