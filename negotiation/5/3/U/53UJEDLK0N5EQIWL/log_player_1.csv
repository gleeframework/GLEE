Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  The product is worth a lot to both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's a bit closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and reach a compromise closer to my target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a good deal.  While I value your business, $1,450,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum. This would give you the full value you've stated for the product. Let's close this deal at this fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
