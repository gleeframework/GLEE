Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,450,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target value by continuing to negotiate."

Bob's latest offer is too low.  While I would like to get closer to my desired price, at this point, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a deadlock or a lower price.  It's better to secure the sale to John at $1,200,000, which is still above my minimum threshold."
