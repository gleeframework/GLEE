"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could potentially save your company a significant amount of money and increase efficiency.  I understand it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows you to still gain a substantial return on your investment while giving me a solid profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is $200,000 less than what John is asking.
* **You still gain value:**  Even at $1,000,000, you are getting the product for $200,000 less than its value to you.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
