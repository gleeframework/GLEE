"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of significant value.  I'm offering it to you for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to discussion, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. My strategy will evolve based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $16000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than $15,000.
* **Potential for higher price:** Bob is interested and has shown a willingness to negotiate. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price range.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. While I'm eager to make a deal, $16,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $18,000?  This would give you a fair price and still allow me to achieve my desired outcome. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm presenting a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price point. This signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my position.
* **Focus on Shared Benefits:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution, emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""desired outcome."" 
* **Open Invitation:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Note:**  My strategy is to try and close the deal with Bob in this round. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to consider my remaining rounds carefully and potentially move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $18000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be open to $17000? This would allow us both to make a deal while still staying within our respective budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  While $17,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, there's a risk that Bob could become less willing to negotiate or even walk away entirely. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Accepting the offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations. 

**Note:** This is a calculated decision based on the limited rounds remaining and the need to secure a sale."
