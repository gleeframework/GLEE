Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum of $12,000 as possible.  Starting high gives me room to negotiate downward.  The offer is also attractive enough to Bob to potentially spark a negotiation, which might lead to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is significantly lower than my minimum of $12,000.  It's not worth selling the product for that price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price.

**Strategy:**

While I'm aiming to get as close to $12,000 as possible, I'm not going to immediately sell to John.  I want to see if I can still negotiate with Bob and get a better price.  There's a chance that he might be willing to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,800 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,500, which is still higher than Bob's initial offer, but it's significantly closer to my desired price point. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while remaining firm on my own financial needs. I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and emphasizing the benefits to both of us.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  This approach should encourage Bob to consider a higher price, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is still below my desired price, but it's getting closer to my minimum. Considering the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially lowering the price even more, and the certainty of earning $12,000 from John,  it makes sense to accept Bob's offer.  

**Strategy:**

While I'm aiming for the highest possible price, I'm also aware of the potential for negotiation to go south. Accepting Bob's offer at this point secures a profit while mitigating the risk of getting a lower price with further negotiation."
