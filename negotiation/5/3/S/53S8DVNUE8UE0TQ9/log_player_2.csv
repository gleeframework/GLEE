Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $787,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to close the deal quickly.

I'm willing to come down to $775,000, which is a very reasonable compromise. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Let me know what you think.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $775,000, and you're better off taking the guaranteed $800,000 deal from John than risking a worse outcome by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
