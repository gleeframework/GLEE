"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $1 million, I allow for a few rounds of counteroffers before needing to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $650,000? That feels like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $650,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's not even close to Bob's own perceived value of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** I need to keep the negotiation going to see if I can get a better price.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm serious about my value and forces him to make a more serious counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll receive. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth to Bob to reinforce its value.
* **Setting a Deadline:** By stating ""Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done,"" I subtly imply that I'm not willing to negotiate for much longer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $725,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to Bob's perceived value, I still need to try and get a better deal.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** I'm not willing to give in just yet, as I believe there's room for further negotiation.  
* **Time is on My Side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I can afford to keep negotiating. I'm still in a strong position with John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $725,000 is still too far below what the product is worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $787,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 787500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** By saying ""It's a fair price for both of us,"" I'm appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a subtle element of urgency by saying ""it allows me to close the deal quickly."" This puts a slight pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, that figure is just a bit outside my budget. I can do $750,000, and I think that's a very fair offer. It allows me to get the product and stay within my spending limit. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $750,000 is still significantly below my target of $1,200,000. 
* **Time to Push:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to start pushing for a price closer to my ideal. 
* **John as Leverage:** John is still a viable option, and I can use his offer as a bargaining chip."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm committed to making this deal happen. However, $750,000 is still not enough for me to move forward.  I'm willing to come down to $775,000, which is a very reasonable compromise. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concessions:**  I'm making a small concession, demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm on a decent price.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm increasing the pressure by stating ""I'm ready to close the deal right now."" This implies that I'm not going to play this game for much longer.
* **Value Justification:**  I'm reiterating that the price is ""a very reasonable compromise"" to emphasize that I'm being fair."
