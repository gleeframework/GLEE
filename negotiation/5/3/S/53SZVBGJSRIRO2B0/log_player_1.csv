"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm curious to see how much Bob values the product and whether he's willing to meet me at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to settle immediately. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing my willingness to compromise. It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but closer to Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is a decent compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and I'm not confident I can push for a higher price in the remaining rounds. It's important to remember that each round I reject could potentially lead to selling to John for $120.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
