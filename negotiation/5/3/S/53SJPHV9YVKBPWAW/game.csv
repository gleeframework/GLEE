"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise considering the product's value to you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about $8,500? That's a fair offer considering your initial asking price and my budget.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is as close as I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, this is getting very close to a deal that works for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,850?",8850.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to meet you exactly in the middle at $8,850. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,100. This is as close as I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin.",9100.0,Alice,7,
