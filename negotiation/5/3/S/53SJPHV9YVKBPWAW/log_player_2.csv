Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,200. This is as close as I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to meet you exactly in the middle at $8,850. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $9,100. This is as close as I can get to your target price without compromising my own profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $9,100 secures a significant savings compared to John's $12,000 price.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice hardening her position or the deal falling through."
