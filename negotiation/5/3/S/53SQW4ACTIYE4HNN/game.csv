"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $6,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",6500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit too high for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $6,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for both of us.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $5,500? That seems like a fair compromise.",5500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,500 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $6,200. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you.",6200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $6,000 is about as high as I can go.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal today.",6000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a significant concession from you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the product's value to you, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll meet you at $6,100. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",6100.0,Alice,7,
