"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm happy to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This gives me a strong starting point.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion. This helps build rapport with Bob and increases the chance of a successful negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $100 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85?  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay $120, so even $85 is a good deal for him.  There's still room for a better price for me.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation.  This allows me to set a higher counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John is an option, I'm not desperate for a quick sale.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate you coming down on the price. $85 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By offering to split the difference, I show Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and find a compromise. This creates a sense of fairness and increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $92.50 is still significantly higher than my minimum value of $80, so I'm not losing out on a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I continue to use a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable and maintain a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  Let's try $90.  That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $90 is very close to my desired price of $100, and significantly higher than my minimum value of $80.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away completely or settling for a lower price with John.
* **Fair compromise:**  $90 represents a fair compromise, considering Bob's initial offer of $85.

It's important to balance my desire for the highest price with the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting $90 is a good outcome and allows me to move on."
