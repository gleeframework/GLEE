Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic markup:**  The offered price of $2,250,000 represents a 50% markup from Bob's valuation. This aims for a significant profit while still being potentially within Bob's acceptable range, depending on how much he values acquiring the product. 
* **Confident tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a fair reflection of that value. This can make Bob more amenable to the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move. If Bob rejects this initial offer, we can always negotiate downwards, with the knowledge that we have a fallback option with John."
