Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while I have another interested buyer, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Knowing John provides a safety net, you're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Strategic Wording:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of another buyer, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, this strategy aims to balance risk with the potential for a higher reward."
