"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I believe it has immense potential for your business too. I'm proposing a price of $900000, which reflects its value and allows for a profitable opportunity for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's meet in the middle at $850000. This price acknowledges the value for you while still being reasonable for me.  Let's see if we can make this work!",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another serious offer of $775000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the fact that we're getting closer. However, $775000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer a final price of $825000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $795000. I believe this is the maximum I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to explore other options, including purchasing from John for $800000.",795000.0,Bob,6,
