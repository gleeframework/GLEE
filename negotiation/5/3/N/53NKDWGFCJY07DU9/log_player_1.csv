Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still making a profit. 

Let's see what Bob's response is before deciding on further action!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer.  How about $9,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a little higher than what I'm aiming for. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is close enough to my desired value and a good compromise.  I'm confident I can find another buyer for a higher price, but there's always a risk involved.  It's better to secure a sale now and move on."
