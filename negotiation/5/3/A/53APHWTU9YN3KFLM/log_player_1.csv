Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $140 is still above Bob's perceived value ($100), but it might tempt him if he thinks it's a good deal or a fair price. 
* **Below John's Offer:** The offer is significantly lower than John's guaranteed $150 offer, ensuring that if Bob accepts, you're still making a profit.

**Important:**  There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at a higher price, you haven't lost anything by attempting to get a higher price from Bob."
