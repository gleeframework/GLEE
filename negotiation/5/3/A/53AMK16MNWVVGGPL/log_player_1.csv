Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is too low for me. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob before going to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  That's a significant step up from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a bit closer, it's still not close enough to what I'm willing to accept. I'm hopeful I can get a better price from Bob, but I'm also willing to move on to John if it looks like I won't."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a product you value while I get a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $10,000 even?  It's a win-win - I get the product at a price I can afford, and you get a quick sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to what I'm willing to accept, and it ensures a quick sale. I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and then having to settle for John's offer, which is only $2,000 more."
