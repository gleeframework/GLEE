"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures you get a product you value while I get a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's close this deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $10,000 even?  It's a win-win - I get the product at a price I can afford, and you get a quick sale.",10000.0,Bob,6,
