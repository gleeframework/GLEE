It's always worth trying to negotiate and get a better price.  Since Alice's offer is below your maximum, there's room to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This price is still below my maximum, but leaves room for compromise."

Alice's offer is a good compromise and still below my $15,000 maximum. Accepting it will allow me to buy the product while still saving some money compared to buying from John."
