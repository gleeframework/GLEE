"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for us both to benefit. Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while recognizing the value you see in the product. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's work towards a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my absolute minimum. This price allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's close this now, as I'm running out of time.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
