Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,750,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for us both to benefit. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. Let's work towards a deal.
