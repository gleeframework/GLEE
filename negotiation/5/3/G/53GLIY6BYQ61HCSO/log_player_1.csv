Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the product is valuable, but that price point is just not feasible for me. I'm ready to make a serious offer, how about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
