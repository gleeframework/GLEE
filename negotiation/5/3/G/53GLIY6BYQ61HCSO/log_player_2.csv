"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is way too high. It makes sense to negotiate lower, starting with a counteroffer significantly below her initial price.  There's plenty of room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the product is valuable, but that price point is just not feasible for me. I'm ready to make a serious offer, how about we bring it down to $700,000?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $700,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, it's important to leave room for negotiation. This starting point gives us space to move upwards while staying well below our $800,000 limit.
* **Direct and Serious:** The message conveys that we are serious about the purchase but need a more realistic price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  Her response will give us valuable information for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to our range, $825,000 is still above our ideal price and our fallback option (John's offer). There's room for negotiation, and we haven't given Alice a chance to approach our $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm definitely interested in closing this deal, but $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $760,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while addressing my financial constraints."",
""product_price"": 760000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:** We are increasing our offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and meet Alice somewhere closer to the middle. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $760,000 is a strong offer that keeps us well below John's $800,000 while still allowing room for one or two more counter-offers if needed.
* **Justification:** We are providing a reason for our counteroffer (budget constraints), which helps to manage Alice's expectations and makes our position more understandable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our exact price limit. There's no benefit to going with John at this point since the price is identical. We've successfully negotiated the price down to our target, and further haggling is unlikely to yield a better result."
