"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the product is valuable, but that price point is just not feasible for me. I'm ready to make a serious offer, how about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm definitely interested in closing this deal, but $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you consider $760,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while addressing my financial constraints.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $760,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
