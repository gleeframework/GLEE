It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing.  $9,500 is a good price, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer.  This will let me see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly.  If she rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice has moved a bit, but I still think I can get a better deal.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get her closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still want a better price. Hopefully, this will encourage her to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still pretty far off from my target price, but we're making progress. I'll try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to $9,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it will entice Alice to accept.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, and we're now very close to my target price. Accepting this offer allows me to save a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars with continued negotiation, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether or running out of rounds."
