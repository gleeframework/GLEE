Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit and I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land somewhere above your minimum.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response will indicate how much he values the product. If he readily accepts the $100, you might have gone even higher. If he rejects it, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and positive tone throughout the negotiation helps keep the interaction amicable, increasing the chances of a successful sale."
