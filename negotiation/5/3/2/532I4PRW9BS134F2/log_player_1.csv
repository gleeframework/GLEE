"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This establishes a strong initial position and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" of the product, aiming to justify the high starting price.
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial price is high, it's not so outrageous as to completely deter Bob. This encourages him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his maximum budget, but it's significantly below my minimum. Accepting would be a substantial loss. I'll reject and counter-offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that price doesn't work for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we consider $1,150,000? This reflects the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** I've made a substantial drop from my initial price, signaling flexibility and a desire to make a deal. 
* **Above Target:**  This counteroffer is still significantly above both Bob's budget and my absolute minimum, preserving room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify a price higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his maximum budget. It's becoming clear he's unlikely to budge significantly. I'll reject again, but in the next round, I'll start moving closer to the middle ground to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not at a major loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm genuinely trying to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my commitment to making this deal happen."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between his last offer ($800,000) and my last counter ($1,150,000). It signals a strong willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** While lower, the price is still comfortably above my $1,000,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  The message highlights my effort to find common ground and make a deal. This could encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counter-offer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. How about we try $900,000? This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value of the product to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, But Not Enough:** Bob is definitely negotiating, and $900,000 is tempting. However, I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 
* **Few Rounds Remain:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation. Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer at this stage.
* **Final Push:** I'll reject to signal that I'm not desperate. In the next round, I'll make a final offer very close to my minimum, hoping he'll take it rather than risk losing the deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: $980,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I believe this is fair considering the value you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 980000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my best and last price. This creates a sense of urgency.
* **Slight Concession:** The price is a small concession from my previous offer but still above John's guaranteed price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning John isn't a bluff (I have that option) and adds pressure for Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to make the price more palatable."
