"Alice, $1,300,000 is too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While that price doesn't work for me, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we consider $1,150,000? This reflects the product's true worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  Let's work together to make this happen.",800000.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's make this simple: $980,000, and we have a deal. This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I believe this is fair considering the value you're getting.",980000.0,Alice,7,
