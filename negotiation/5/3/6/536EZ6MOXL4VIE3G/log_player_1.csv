{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $12,000 is closer to your desired price than Bob's perceived value.
* **Start a conversation:**  A clear message encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price slightly while still potentially earning more than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am able to offer $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value and a significant improvement from his offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Rejecting this offer allows me to try and secure a higher price."
