"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it can significantly benefit your business. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This achieves a few things:
    * **Anchoring:** It sets a high reference point in Bob's mind. 
    * **Room for Negotiation:** It gives me ample space to negotiate down and make concessions, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
    * **Signals Value:** A high price often implies high value, even if it's negotiable.
* **Open to Discussion:** My message emphasizes that this is just an opening offer, and I'm genuinely interested in understanding Bob's perspective. This encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **John's Offer:** I have a strong fallback option with John, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at any cost. This gives me leverage.
* **10 Rounds:**  We have time to negotiate, which allows for a more nuanced approach.  I won't rush into accepting a low offer early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum, I want to explore if I can get a better price. I started high to give myself room to negotiate, and accepting his first offer immediately might leave money on the table.  I'm confident I can get closer to his perceived value of $1,000,000 without losing him as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. To find some middle ground, I'm proposing $1,450,000.  I believe this price reflects the value this product will bring to your business, while still recognizing your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant drop from my initial offer to show Bob I'm flexible and serious about finding an agreement.
* **Above Both Minimums:**  This price is still comfortably above both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,200,000), leaving space for further negotiation if needed.
* **Value Focus:** I'm subtly shifting the conversation back to the value the product offers, reminding Bob of the potential benefits to his business."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your revised offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily moving towards his perceived value, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. A $100,000 difference remains between his current offer and my minimum. I'm willing to counter again, but I'll make it clear that I'm getting closer to my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working together to find a fair price.  To be candid, I'm getting close to the lowest I can go. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, but that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($75,000) to signal that I'm nearing my limit.  The language ""final offer"" adds weight to this point.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer splits the difference between his last offer ($1,300,000) and my previous counter ($1,450,000), encouraging him to see it as a compromise.
* **Time Consideration:** While we have rounds remaining, I don't want to drag this out unnecessarily, especially if Bob is unwilling to move significantly.  
* **John as Backup:** I'm still comfortable walking away if Bob rejects this offer, knowing I have John's guaranteed purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're getting close to your lowest price, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer is now only $50,000 below my ""final offer"" and a decent margin above my absolute minimum. Trying to extract that last bit might push him away.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now gives me the certainty of payment and allows me to move on to other opportunities. Prolonging negotiations for a relatively small gain isn't ideal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk that Bob walks away entirely if I push further. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit. 

While I could try for a bit more, accepting this offer represents a strong outcome in a realistic negotiation scenario."
