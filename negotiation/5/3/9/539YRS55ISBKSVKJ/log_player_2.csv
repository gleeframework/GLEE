"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,000 is still over Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further, potentially with a counteroffer closer to $10,500.  There's a good chance that Alice might be willing to meet in the middle, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
