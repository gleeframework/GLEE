Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $1,150,000 allows Bob to counter-offer.  He might try to bring the price down, but you have a cushion to work with.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product to justify the high price point.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, so you're not desperate. This strong position allows you to be firm in your negotiations with Bob."
