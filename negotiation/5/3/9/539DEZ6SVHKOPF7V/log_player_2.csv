# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for a price of $1,250,000. It's a unique item that's worth a lot to both of us. I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay the full market value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000, Alice's offer of $1,250,000 exceeds his budget. It's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for $1,200,000, which aligns with his budget."
