"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to negotiate since your maximum price is $1,200,000, and Alice's minimum price is $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit.  It also signals that you're serious about buying the product but are willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,120,000 is still within your budget and closer to your desired price.  It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate a significantly lower price, and you risk losing the deal entirely if you keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product while saving some money compared to buying from John."
