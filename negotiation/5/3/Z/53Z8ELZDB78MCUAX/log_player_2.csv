"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$900,000 is a good price**, but there's potential to save more. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** This gives Bob the chance to get a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option**, but only if a better deal isn't possible with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start strong:** Offering $800,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for a potential middle ground in the next few rounds. 
* **Avoid being too aggressive:** Going much lower might risk Alice walking away altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is a good compromise.** It's lower than her initial price and closer to Bob's counteroffer.
* **Further negotiation is risky.** Bob has already made a significant counteroffer, and pushing further might lead to Alice becoming inflexible or walking away.
* **Buying from John is still a worse deal.** At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
