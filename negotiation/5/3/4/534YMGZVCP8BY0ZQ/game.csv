"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to make a significant profit while still leaving me with a substantial return. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer, but $700,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $850,000 for this deal to work for me.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference between our previous offers and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $825,000.  This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and we could finalize this quickly.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to make a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000 even? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
