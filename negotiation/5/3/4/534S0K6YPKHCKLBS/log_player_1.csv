Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for $1,500,000 gives you a significant potential profit margin.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product helps justify the high price, even though you haven't explicitly stated what the product is.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" can make Bob feel like he's getting a special deal and might be more inclined to pay a premium.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a lower price to increase the chances of Bob accepting quickly, but you'd risk leaving money on the table if he was willing to pay more."
