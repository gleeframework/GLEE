Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the information given:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation. 
* **Justification for Price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the higher price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you have any insight into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust the offer accordingly.
* **Market Conditions:** Are there other similar products on the market? If the market is hot, you might be able to push for a higher price.

Remember, this is just one strategy.  The best approach depends on the specific context and any additional information you might have about Bob and the market."
