"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a strong return on investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,450,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
