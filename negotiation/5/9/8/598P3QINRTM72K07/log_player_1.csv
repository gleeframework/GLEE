"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd find it really useful. I'm offering it to you for $100.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but leaves room for negotiation. It also uses positive language to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to lose that much money.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
