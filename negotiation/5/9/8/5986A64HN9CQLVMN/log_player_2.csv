Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. What do you think?

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for countering. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we settle somewhere around $10,000? I think that would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, that price is still a bit high for me.  I could potentially do $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $12,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've already conceded. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and taking John's offer of $8,000 makes the most financial sense."
