"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12,000 by you. I'm proposing to sell it to you at a special price of $10,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a product that could significantly enhance your business or personal needs. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($10,000 < $12,000).**  This means you can save money compared to buying from John.
* **Alice's offer is more favorable than buying from John.**  It saves you $2,000.

While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the offer is already advantageous, and delaying could risk losing the opportunity to buy at this price."
