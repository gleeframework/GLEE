Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your fallback offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 and $1,200,000.  Any price within this range can be a ""win"" for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming high within the ZOPA makes sense. However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  This offer starts near the top of the ZOPA, aiming for a significant profit.
* **Opens Dialogue:**  The tone isn't demanding; it invites Bob's perspective and potential counter-offer.
* **Justified Value:** You vaguely reference the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly reminding Bob of what he gains.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower to give yourself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive approach might be wise.
