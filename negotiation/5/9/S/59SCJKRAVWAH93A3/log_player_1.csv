"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this point.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $900,000, I'm confident we can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can bridge the gap."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my previous offer of $900,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $900,000. I'm confident we can meet in the middle.  I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
