"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. Can we meet in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think $17,000 is a fair price, but I still think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $14,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I don't think I can go any higher.",14000.0,Bob,4,
