Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think $17,000 is a fair price, but I still think it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $14,000? I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I don't think I can go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and we're getting close to John's offer. It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 rather than risk Bob not increasing his offer substantially in the remaining rounds."
