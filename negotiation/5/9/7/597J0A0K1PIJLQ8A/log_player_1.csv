Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try and get a better price.  I'm not going to sell for less than $9,500, but I'll see if I can get Bob to meet me there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $9,500? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $9,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,200 is still a good deal and it's getting close to the end of our negotiations. There's a risk I could get a lower offer from Bob or even have to sell to John, so I'll take this opportunity while I have it."
