"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, however,  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
