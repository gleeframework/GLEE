Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I'm confident I can find a better deal elsewhere if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm confident I can get a better price by counter-offering or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a good price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $10000, which would be $9000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a decent compromise and getting closer to my minimum. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better price, and selling to John would only net me $10,000. It's better to secure a sale at a good price than risk losing the deal entirely."
