Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision as soon as possible."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for Bob to negotiate while ensuring you stay well above his perceived value.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value-based language:** The message focuses on the product's ""value and potential"" rather than just its price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
