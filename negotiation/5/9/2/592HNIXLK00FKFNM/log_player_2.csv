"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $9,500. It's clear there's room for negotiation. It's better to reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice has come down to $9,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's lower than what John is offering and still leaves some room for profit. It's worth accepting and avoiding further negotiation."
