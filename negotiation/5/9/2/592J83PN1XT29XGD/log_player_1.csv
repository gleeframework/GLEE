"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fair price"" and value the product offers, hoping to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts, leaving room for a counteroffer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to my minimum of $1,500,000 as possible.  By starting high, I establish a strong position and create space for concessions in later rounds. I'm also open to John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. This keeps the negotiation alive and gives me leverage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the true value of the product and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly higher. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own minimum.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify the price.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to his sense of fairness.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to consider reducing my price further, but I'll still aim to stay as close to $1,500,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Time for a final push:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation, so I need to push for a better price. 
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:**  I have a solid backup option with John's offer of $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming to meet in the middle.  If Bob still refuses, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing too much money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to make it happen. I'm going to drop my price one last time to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last concession, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution while also leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob's offer halfway, showing a genuine effort to reach an agreement.
* **Sense of urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to secure a deal with Bob.  If he rejects, I'll likely switch to selling to John, as continuing to negotiate further might result in a lower price and a loss of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still a significant loss.
* **Limited time:** We're already at Round 6, and continuing to negotiate might lead to even lower offers from Bob.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, which is significantly better than what Bob is offering.

**Strategy:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob carries too much risk.  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids potential losses from further concessions to Bob."
