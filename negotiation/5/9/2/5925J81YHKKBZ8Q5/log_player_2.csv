"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its high value to you, I believe it's only fair to present it at a rate that reflects its true worth. I propose to sell the product to you for $100. This price not only ensures a good return for me but also allows you to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its market value. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and make the transaction beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

Alice's offer is lower than your maximum price, but there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to get a better price from her or resort to buying from John for $120."
