"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. However, $1500000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair compromise considering the unique benefits this product offers.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1750000 is the right price for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm always willing to discuss.  However, $1400000 simply doesn't reflect the unique features and potential of this product.  Let's be realistic,  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1600000.  This offer is fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products and the potential benefits this product could bring to my business.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1350000 simply doesn't reflect the unique value and potential this product offers.  Considering we've already been through several rounds, I'm willing to make a final compromise.  My final offer is $1550000. This price is more than fair, and it allows us to close this deal efficiently. What do you say?",1550000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1300000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, considering the market value and potential benefits. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
