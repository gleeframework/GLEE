```

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential benefits for Bob.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product could bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your position. However, $1,500,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the unique benefits this product offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Bob is dropping the price again.  While $1,400,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still in a strong position. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better offer. I'm not going to sell to John yet, because I have a chance to get more from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm always willing to discuss.  However, $1,400,000 simply doesn't reflect the unique features and potential of this product.  Let's be realistic,  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,600,000.  This offer is fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
