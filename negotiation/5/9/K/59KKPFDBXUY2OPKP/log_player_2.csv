# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm always willing to discuss.  However, $1400000 simply doesn't reflect the unique features and potential of this product.  Let's be realistic,  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1600000.  This offer is fair and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1350000 simply doesn't reflect the unique value and potential this product offers.
