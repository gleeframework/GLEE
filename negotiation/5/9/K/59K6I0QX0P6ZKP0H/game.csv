"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. Could you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. However, $750,000 is still considerably below its true value.  How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,5,
