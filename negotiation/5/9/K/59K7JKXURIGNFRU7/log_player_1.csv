Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $1,200,000 is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Profit:** By starting high, I give myself room to negotiate downward while still achieving a profit.
* **Encourage Negotiation:**  A clear offer shows I'm serious about selling, but the price leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Maintain Option:** The ""John"" factor creates pressure on Bob to negotiate, knowing I have a backup offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  By rejecting his counteroffer, I show that I am not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Continue Negotiation:** This gives me the opportunity to counter with a more reasonable price, pushing for a more profitable outcome.
* **Pressure Bob:**  Bob is aware of my backup option with John, which adds pressure for him to negotiate in good faith."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need, I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still allow you to realize a significant return on your investment, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $900,000 is a middle ground between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($600,000).
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's budget limitations while emphasizing the potential value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.

**Rationale:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Balance:** $900,000 offers a fair price that considers both my minimum and Bob's budget.
* **Pressure:** It subtly reminds Bob that I have an alternative buyer waiting (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I would ideally want. Selling at this price would result in a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  It demonstrates that I am not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Continue Negotiation:** This allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Pressure Bob:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John at a much higher price puts pressure on Bob to negotiate in good faith."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still quite far from what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000, but that's my absolute bottom line.  Consider the long-term value this product can bring to your business, and let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** $850,000 is a compromise,  closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Message:** It acknowledges Bob's compromise while emphasizing the value of the product and the need for a price that allows me to cover my costs.
* **Finality:**  ""Absolute bottom line"" suggests this is my last offer, adding pressure for Bob to accept.

**Rationale:**

* **Gradual Approach:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By offering a slightly lower price, I demonstrate flexibility while maintaining my minimum acceptable amount.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  The phrase ""absolute bottom line"" signals a potential end to negotiations, making Bob more likely to reconsider."
