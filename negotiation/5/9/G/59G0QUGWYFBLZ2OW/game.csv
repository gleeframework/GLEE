"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $10,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $9,500 is still a little low for me. Would you consider $10,500?  This price is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than what it's worth to you. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,6,
