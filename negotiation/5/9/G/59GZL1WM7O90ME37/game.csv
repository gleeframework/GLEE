"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product but I'd only be able to go as high as $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $105. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm offering $95. This feels fair given our negotiation so far.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $102. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product can bring to you, and it's closer to my initial offer.",102.0,Alice,5,
