{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than your $120 minimum, which is good.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Leaving room for negotiation will make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is brief and to the point. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120 for this product. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price. There's a good chance he's willing to pay a bit more, especially since he values the product at $150.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
