"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $140, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $140 is a good starting point as it's above Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Openness:** By mentioning being open to negotiation, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I still have 9 rounds to potentially reach a higher price with him before resorting to selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. Given my budget, I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can agree upon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is within his value range, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I have nine rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $150, ensuring I at least break even."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, considering your interest. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** $130 is higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting interest:** Mentioning Bob's interest shows I'm taking his perspective into account.
* **Seeking middle ground:**  Phrasing it as ""finding a middle ground"" suggests a collaborative approach.

This strategy aims to:

*  Keep the negotiation going to potentially reach a higher price.
*  Avoid selling to John yet, as there's still room for a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $125 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $125 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $150.
* **Potential for higher price:**  I have six rounds remaining to potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, selling to John for $150 ensures I at least break even."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price closer to $135. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still accommodating your needs. Would you be willing to consider this final compromise?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints, but also emphasizing that I need a higher price. 
* **Offer a ""Final"" Compromise:**  This makes it seem like I'm making my last concession, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Reminding Bob of his ""needs"" suggests the product is valuable to him, increasing the chance of him accepting.

**Strategy:**

* **Move closer to my goal:** This offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price than the previous offer.
* **Put pressure on Bob:** The ""final compromise"" phrasing puts the onus on Bob to accept.
* **Still have backup:**  Selling to John for $150 remains an option if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. After careful consideration, I am willing to pay $130 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 finally meets my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited rounds left:** With only four rounds remaining, there's a high risk that I won't be able to get a higher price with Bob.
* **Uncertainty with John:** There's no guarantee that John will still be willing to buy the product if I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a deal that meets my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
