Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while still achieving a price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial offer and still significantly higher than my minimum. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept."
