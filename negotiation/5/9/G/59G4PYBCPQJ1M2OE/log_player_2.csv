"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a good profit as well. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'll choose to reject Alice's offer. If I buy from her, I'll be paying $9,500, which is $1,500 more than I'm willing to pay. I'll wait for a better offer or try to find the product from John for $10,000.
