Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $180 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $180.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my original asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit to $190.  That's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 190}

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I'm still holding out for a price closer to $190, but I'm also aware that I'm getting close to the time limit.  I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $182.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $170 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $170 is getting closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can get at least $175.  It's a gamble, but I'm feeling optimistic that I can get a better price with just a few rounds left."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm not convinced that I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm not willing to go below $150, and I'd rather sell to John than risk losing out on a sale altogether."
