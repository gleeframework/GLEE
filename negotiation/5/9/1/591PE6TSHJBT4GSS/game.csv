"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, after careful consideration, I am unable to accept $12,500 for this product. My minimum acceptable price remains at $13,500. I hope we can find common ground to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
