"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
