Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $115 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($20) while still ensuring Bob gets a deal (saving $5).  

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a profitable price and avoiding a situation where Bob rejects the offer, forcing you to accept the lower offer from John."
