Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I want to gauge his interest and see how far he's willing to go. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000.  This is a small increase from his last offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but am also firm in my belief that the product is worth more. I'm hoping this will be close enough to get Bob to accept."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for less than $13,500.  We've gone back and forth a few times, and I'm hoping a counteroffer at $13,500 will get us to an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob is still holding firm at a price lower than my minimum.  While $12,500 is tempting, I don't want to risk losing out on a better offer. I'll take John's offer and sell the product for $12,000."
