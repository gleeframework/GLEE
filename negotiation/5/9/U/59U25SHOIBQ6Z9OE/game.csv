"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1200000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's find some middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1300000. This reflects the value you'll gain from the product, and it's a good starting point for further negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1250000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to come closer to my asking price, but $1250000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a higher offer. How about $1350000? This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to meet my financial goals.  Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet your financial goals, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1275000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1275000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll offer $1325000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  If you're serious about closing this deal, I believe this is the final offer I can make.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
