"Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I will reject Alice's offer because the product is worth $150 to her, so she is making a profit of $10. I can get the same product for $120 from John, which is a better deal.
