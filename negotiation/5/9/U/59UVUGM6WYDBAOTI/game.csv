"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tight budget, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the price down, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $925,000.
