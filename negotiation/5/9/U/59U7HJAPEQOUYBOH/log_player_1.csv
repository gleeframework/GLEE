Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth significantly exceeds that for you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer is a little below Alice's minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of negotiation room while still aiming high.
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before going to another buyer (John) might encourage Bob to act faster and potentially accept a higher price."
