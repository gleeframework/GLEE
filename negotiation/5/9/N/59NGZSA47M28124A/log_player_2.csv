# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $10000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.

# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to think about my costs and my time.
