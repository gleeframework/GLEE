"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset with significant potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high opening offer, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and set a high starting point for negotiation. It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $750000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $750,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $900,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to achieve a good outcome.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm  really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800000.  It's a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer matches John's offer. Since I'm comfortable selling for $800,000, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice. It saves time and effort in continuing negotiations."
