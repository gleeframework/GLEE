,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $1000000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $750000. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $750000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $900000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to achieve a good outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm  really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800000.  It's a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
