Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  While it is tempting to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I will counteroffer and see if he is willing to come up."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000

While $780,000 is a decent offer, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll make a counteroffer and try to push closer to my desired amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be.  Let's compromise. How about $820,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 820000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While Bob is getting closer, I'm going to try and push for a little bit more. I'm not too worried about John just yet, as I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob."
