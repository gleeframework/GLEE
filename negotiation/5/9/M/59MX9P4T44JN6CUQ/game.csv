"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $850000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin, and it's closer to what the product is worth. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $780000?",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be.  Let's compromise. How about $820000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $820000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $760000?",760000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $760000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $800000?  It's a fair price for both of us and a good middle ground.  Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Alice,7,
