"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an excellent opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth $10,000 to you at a slightly discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500.  While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There's room for both parties to find a price that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's still a good price for you, and it saves me some money. Let's see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. My current offer stands at $9,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a good deal for Bob. It's still a better price than buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a slightly lower price, if any.  There's not much to gain by rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate."
