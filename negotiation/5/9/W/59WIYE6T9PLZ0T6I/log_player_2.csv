"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $120 is above your maximum budget of $150.
* **There's room for negotiation:** You can likely get a better price, especially since Alice's value for the product is only $80.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  You can always go to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Considering Alice's value:** $100 is still more than Alice's value for the product, making the deal potentially profitable for her. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially set the stage for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your budget:** While Alice has come down, $110 is still above your ideal price.

* **John's offer remains a safe option:** You can still buy from John if this negotiation falls apart."

* **Testing the waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge Alice's commitment to a deal and her potential for further concessions."
