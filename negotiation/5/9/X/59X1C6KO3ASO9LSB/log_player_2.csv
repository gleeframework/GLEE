"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price of $120. This is a fair offer, as it's the price I'm willing to pay and it's still a profit for Alice considering her value of $150.  If she rejects, I can always buy from John for the same price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still above my maximum budget of $120. While I could counter-offer again, there's no guarantee she'll accept. It's more efficient and less risky to just buy from John at my target price."
