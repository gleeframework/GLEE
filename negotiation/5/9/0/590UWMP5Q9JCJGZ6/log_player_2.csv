"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000.  This allows you to secure the product at a considerable gain, while still providing me with a profitable outcome.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price or sticking with John's offer as a fallback."
