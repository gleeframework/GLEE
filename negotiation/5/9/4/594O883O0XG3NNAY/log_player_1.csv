Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, $1,000,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
