# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll appreciate the value of the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $990,000. It's still a great deal for me, but I'm willing to give you a little more flexibility. What do you think?

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $990,000, and John offers the product for $1,000,000. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a tiny potential saving."
