"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. It's still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll appreciate the value of the product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a fair offer for both of us, I think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000. How about we try $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great value for the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I respect that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget. My absolute highest I can go is $975,000.  This offer reflects how seriously I'm considering this product.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $990,000. It's still a great deal for me, but I'm willing to give you a little more flexibility. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,7,
