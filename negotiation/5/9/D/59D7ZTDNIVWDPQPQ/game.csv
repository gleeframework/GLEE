"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $14,000, which represents a considerable discount from my initial offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $14,000 is still beyond my budget.  Could you meet me halfway at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  How about $11,000? This is a significant price reduction, and I'm getting closer to my bottom line.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $8,000?  That's the absolute highest I can go.",8000.0,Bob,6,
