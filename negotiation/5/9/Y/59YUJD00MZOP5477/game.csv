"Hi Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but $85 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. Let me know if that works for you.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still too high for me. How about $100? I believe this price is fair considering your value and my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a significant discount from my original offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
