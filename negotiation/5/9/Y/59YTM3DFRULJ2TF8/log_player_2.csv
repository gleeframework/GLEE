"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm proposing an initial offer of $950,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good starting point, it's still above the product's worth to me.
* **Negotiation potential:** I can likely secure a better price through counteroffers. 
* **Time to explore options:** I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to negotiate with Alice without immediately resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'd like to offer you $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both understand it holds."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Alice's offer is still significantly above my desired price point. 
* **Further negotiation:** I'm confident that I can get a better price through continued negotiations.
* **Time on my side:**  I have multiple rounds remaining, so I'm not under pressure to accept a suboptimal deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about finding a compromise, I'm willing to accept $895,000. This is my final offer, as it's crucial for me to get a fair price for the value this product delivers.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close:** Alice's offer is now very close to my ideal price point. 
* **Potential risk:** If I reject this offer, Alice might become less willing to negotiate, and I could end up paying more in later rounds.
* **John's price:**  While I could buy from John for $1,000,000, this offer is significantly better than that.

Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a favorable price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
