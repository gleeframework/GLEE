"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to negotiate or buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating."
