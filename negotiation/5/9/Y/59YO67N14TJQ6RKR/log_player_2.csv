"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can likely get a better deal than $1,350,000.  Alice's minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, and Bob's maximum is $1,500,000. There is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is in the middle of his maximum ($1,500,000) and Alice's minimum ($1,200,000). This is a fair starting point for negotiation and gives Alice a reason to consider the offer while still leaving room for Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what Bob could potentially negotiate. By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer that is closer to his desired price range and potentially get a better deal than Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and is still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still being within his desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's $50,000 less than John's offer, and it's likely that continuing to negotiate will only result in a few thousand dollars of savings. 

Since the potential savings are minimal, it makes sense to accept the offer and avoid the risk of Alice getting frustrated and ending the negotiation."
