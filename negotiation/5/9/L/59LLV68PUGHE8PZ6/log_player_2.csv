"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is higher than her own valuation, it's still lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and the price John offers. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John."
