"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation. I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so $900,000 is a good starting point. This allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum goal of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  It's a fair deal considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum target of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept such a low offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm reducing my price from $900,000 to $850,000, which is still above my minimum target. This shows a willingness to compromise while staying within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer, and I think it represents a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a better offer than Bob's previous one, it's still below my minimum target of $800,000. I'm not ready to sell for less than that, and I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 still falls short of my expectations. Let's get closer to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $825,000. This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm reducing my price again to $825,000, which is only $25,000 above my minimum target. This shows a continued commitment to negotiation and may push Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer to $775,000. That's a substantial move on my part, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to reaching a fair agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is getting closer to my minimum target, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'm still hopeful we can find a middle ground that benefits both of us. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there!  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is my absolute minimum. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I believe this is a good compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

I've finally reached my minimum target of $800,000. It's time to make a firm offer and see if Bob is ready to close the deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John and secure my minimum goal."
