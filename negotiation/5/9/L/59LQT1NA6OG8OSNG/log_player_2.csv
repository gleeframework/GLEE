"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget.  There's no incentive to negotiate further as there's no potential for a better price. You might get a better price from John, but there's no guarantee. To ensure you get the product, buying from John at $1,000,000 is the best option."
