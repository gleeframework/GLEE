"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $10000. It's a real steal, and I believe it's worth much more than that to the right person. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me.  While I'm definitely interested, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9250 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9000?  That would be a great price for both of us, and it's a deal that I'm confident I can make work.",9000.0,Bob,4,
