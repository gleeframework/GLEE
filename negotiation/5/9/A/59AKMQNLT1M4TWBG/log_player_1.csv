Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you thinking of me.  While I'm definitely interested, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
