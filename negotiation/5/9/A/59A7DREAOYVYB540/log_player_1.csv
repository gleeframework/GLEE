"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's worth a lot more than that to me, so this is a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's high but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I emphasize the product's worth to Bob, encouraging him to see the value proposition.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I state that it's worth more to me, but I'm offering a fair price. This implies flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  I'm aiming for at least $10,000, and Bob's offer is below that.  
* **Potential for better deal:** Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **Rounds remaining:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise by meeting halfway between our previous offers. This shows willingness to negotiate and reach a deal.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to make my price seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there at $12,000.  Let's split the difference again and go with $11,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** Bob's offer of $11,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Time is ticking:** We are already in round 4, and the negotiation could continue for several more rounds.
* **Risk of a lower offer:** There is a chance that Bob will continue to lower his offers, and I could end up with a worse deal than this.
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  Even though I'm accepting this offer, there's still room for future negotiation if we have ongoing business relationships in the future."
