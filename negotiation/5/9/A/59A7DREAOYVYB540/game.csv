"Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's worth a lot more than that to me, so this is a fair price. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there at $12,000.  Let's split the difference again and go with $11,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this.",11500.0,Bob,4,
