"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's worth a lot more than that to me, so this is a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $13,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $11,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $13,000, it's still not the ideal price. Bob should keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still not quite there at $12,000.  Let's split the difference again and go with $11,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 11500}
