{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd be a great fit for it. My asking price is $18,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000). This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm indicating that I'm flexible and willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm focusing on the product's value to Bob, implying it's worth considering a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers.
* If Bob is unwilling to negotiate, I'll likely accept a counteroffer close to my minimum price to avoid losing the sale. 
* If the negotiation drags on and seems unproductive, I'll switch to John, who offers a guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $14,000 is still above my minimum of $12,000, but it's significantly lower than my initial asking price.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my original ask, potentially reaching a compromise.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:** While accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, it might be too low, and I could potentially get a better price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John now guarantees $12,000, but I'm hoping to get more from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my original asking price but higher than his counteroffer. This approach signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob that he's getting a good deal at $16,000, highlighting the product's worth.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or switch to John.
* If Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low, I'll be more inclined to move to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's not ideal, I could potentially negotiate further with Bob if I reject his offer. However, the risk of losing him entirely is high.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming, and I'm already nearing my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, securing a sale for a price that's relatively close to my desired minimum.
* I'll move on to other potential sales or business opportunities."
