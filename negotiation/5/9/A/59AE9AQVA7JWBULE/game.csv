"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16000. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $15500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of this product.",15500.0,Bob,4,
