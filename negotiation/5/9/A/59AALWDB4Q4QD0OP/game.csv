,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  $80 is quite a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. ",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $125 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we try something around $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. I'm willing to go down a bit further to $110. That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair to both of us. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being willing to work with me.  $110 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $100?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
