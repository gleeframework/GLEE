"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good amount. My starting price is $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than what I need to make a profit, but I'm leaving room to negotiate.  I think it's a good tactic to start high, and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I could sell to John for $150, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob a bit more. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you showing interest!  $80 is quite a bit lower than what I was hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. While $125 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we try something around $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  While $95 is better than $80, it's still below my minimum. I'll counter with a lower price, but I'm still not ready to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. I'm willing to go down a bit further to $110. That's a good compromise, and I think it's fair to both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being willing to work with me.  $110 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $100?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  I'd rather sell to John for $150, but I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
