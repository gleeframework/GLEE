"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
