"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! As we've discussed, this product is worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your purchase. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You have room to maneuver since the product is worth $15,000 to you.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to spend a little less.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,500, which is a significant concession.  While you might be able to squeeze out a bit more, it's likely Alice is at her limit.  Accepting the offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John.  The risk of further negotiation is not worth the potential gain, as Alice might simply walk away, and you'd be left buying from John at a higher price."
