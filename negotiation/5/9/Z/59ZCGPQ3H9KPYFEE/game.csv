"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,000. This would be a great price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value for the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
