"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm aiming high to establish a strong initial position. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to both of us, there's always room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high starting price provides significant space to negotiate downwards during subsequent rounds if needed. 
* **Projecting Confidence:**  A strong opening offer suggests confidence in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for reaching out, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. I am proposing a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. We are early in the process, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is a solid backup but not ideal at this stage. I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, I believe the product's true value warrants a higher price. I'm proposing $1,650,000."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Almost):**  I've come down from $1,800,000 to $1,650,000, effectively meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers. This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a strong price.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I'm not dropping the price too drastically to avoid signaling desperation. I want to keep Bob engaged while holding firm on the value of the product.

Let's see if Bob finds this offer more agreeable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to keep the negotiations open. I am proposing a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 represents a significant profit margin above my minimum of $1,000,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging negotiations further might not yield a significantly better offer. Accepting now secures the profit.
* **Potential Risk:**  There's always a chance Bob could walk away or significantly lower his offer in later rounds. Accepting now mitigates that risk. 

While I could push for a bit more, the potential gains are outweighed by the risks of losing the current offer.  Accepting $1,600,000 is a good outcome."
