Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is too low. I'm willing to come down to $135.  I'm confident this is still a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 135}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $117.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good starting point to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm ready to pay $115 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where I don't think I can get a better price from Bob. While $115 is close to my minimum, John is offering me $150, which is significantly higher. It's time to move on and sell to John."
