{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is coming down in price, but Bob is still determined to get a better deal.  At this point, it's worth exploring if he can get even closer to his desired price range.  The risk of buying from John is still significant, making it worthwhile to keep negotiating with Alice."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is raising her price again, but Bob is still committed to securing a better deal.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** With only one round remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. Alice's offer is back to her initial price of $500,000, but Bob has already demonstrated his willingness to compromise. At this point, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product than to risk losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John for a much higher price.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price, the risk of a stalemate and having to buy from John outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation."
