"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay up to $100, and her offer is $95.
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can offer a lower price and potentially get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** You are aiming to get the price as close to Alice's $80 valuation as possible. 
* **Counteroffer:**  $85 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic considerations:**  This offer signals your seriousness about buying the product, but also shows that you're willing to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above your target price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation.** You can offer a lower price again and potentially get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If you're not satisfied with the progress, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing towards agreement:** Alice has lowered her price, so it's time to slightly raise your offer.
* **Testing the waters:** $88 is still below Alice's valuation but might be acceptable to her.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** This offer balances your desire to save money with the risk of Alice rejecting it. If she does, you can always revert to your previous offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's lowered her price again, it's still above your target price of $100. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.** You can offer a lower price and potentially get a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If the negotiations stall, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close:**  Alice is showing signs of being willing to negotiate. She's lowered her price again, and we're getting closer to your target range.
* **Small increase:**  A small increase to $89 demonstrates that you're serious about making a deal, but you're still committed to saving money. 
* **Risk and reward:** It's a calculated risk. If Alice accepts, you get a good price. If she rejects, you can try again in the next round or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  Even though she's lowered her price, it's still above your target price of $100.
* **Room for one more offer.** You can offer a lower price one more time and see if Alice will budge.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** If Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is likely your last chance to get a better price from Alice before resorting to John.
* **Meeting halfway:**  $90 is a compromise.  It's above your preferred price, but it's also significantly lower than Alice's last offer. 
* **High stakes:** If Alice rejects this offer, you'll probably have to buy from John. But, there's still a chance she'll accept and you'll get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  This is the penultimate round. You have one more chance to negotiate, but the risk of Alice rejecting your offer is high.
* **No significant progress:** Alice's offer hasn't budged much, and it's unlikely she'll go lower at this point.
* **Minimizing losses:**  Buying from John guarantees you'll get the product, albeit at a higher price. Continuing to negotiate risks getting nothing or getting a price that's only slightly better than John's offer. 

It's better to secure the product now and avoid the risk of a last-minute breakdown in the negotiations."
