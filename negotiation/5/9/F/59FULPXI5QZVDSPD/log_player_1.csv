Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the price I've been considering all along. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. What do you say?
