"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** You're getting a $3,000 discount from your maximum value, but there's potential to save more.
* **You have time to negotiate.**  You can reject the offer and make a counteroffer without immediately losing the deal. 
* **John is a backup option.** You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail. This gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.**  Her offer of $11,500 is closer to your initial counteroffer of $10,500. 
* **You are saving a significant amount.**  You'll be paying $3,500 less than your maximum value of $15,000.
* **There's a risk of losing the deal.**  If you continue to reject, Alice may become less willing to negotiate, and you could end up paying more or having to buy from John.

While you could potentially try to negotiate further, accepting the current offer secures a good deal without unnecessary risk."
