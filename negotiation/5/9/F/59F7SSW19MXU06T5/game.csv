"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is too far below the product's value to me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I believe the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However,  $1,050,000 is still slightly below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which would be a great price for both of us.  Let's reach a deal that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand you're close to your target, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
