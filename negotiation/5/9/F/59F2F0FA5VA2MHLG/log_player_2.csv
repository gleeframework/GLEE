"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $9,500. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or simply buy it from John for less."
