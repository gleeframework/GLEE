"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm confident it's a great opportunity, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low. I'll try to negotiate a better price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $600,000 simply wouldn't cover the value I've put into this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll see the value in acquiring it for your business. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $925,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825000. I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting frustrating. Bob is not willing to budge much, and I'm worried I'll run out of rounds before getting a good price. It's time to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John and move on."
