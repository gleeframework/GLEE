"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product for a one-time price of $1,200,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly exceptional, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John is offering. Rejecting this offer opens up the possibility of a better deal from Alice or allows you to purchase from John at a lower price."
