Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it very valuable, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being positive and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob. This creates a more collaborative tone and increases the chance of acceptance.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to answering questions, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's reasonable, I may accept. If not, I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **If negotiations stall:**  I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob is interested, his initial offer shows he's willing to negotiate. I can likely get a higher price by counter-offering.
* **John is a Safe Backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum, aiming for a compromise. I will be careful not to get too close to John's offer as I want to incentivize Bob to close the deal with me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $700,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $850,000? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer ($700,000) but still significantly higher than his offer and closer to my minimum ($1,000,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my position.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable, emphasizing the benefit of the deal for Bob.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, highlighting that the price is still a good deal for him.

**Strategy:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price for the product.
* **If Bob Rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make another counteroffer. If Bob's counteroffer gets closer to my minimum, I may be willing to accept it. 
* **If Negotiations Stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is a fair compromise. It's close to my previous counteroffer of $850,000 and within my acceptable range.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, it risks further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could take more time, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit close to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Future Negotiations:**  I can leverage this negotiation experience to potentially get better prices in future deals."
