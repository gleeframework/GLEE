Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the potential value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which still reflects a strong profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's get this done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and his valuation is significantly higher than our safety net with John.  While he's holding at $1,050,000, we still have room to negotiate and likely secure a better price than John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's settle this right now. How about $1,075,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By calling it my ""final offer"" I introduce a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This price splits the difference between his last offer and my previous one, showing a willingness to find a true middle ground."
