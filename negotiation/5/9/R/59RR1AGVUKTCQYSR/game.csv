"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  While I see the potential value in the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which still reflects a strong profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,050,000 undervalues it. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's get this done.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. Let's settle this right now. How about $1,075,000? That's my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
