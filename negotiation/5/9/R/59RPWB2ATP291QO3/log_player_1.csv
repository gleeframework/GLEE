Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you aim to get as close to that as possible with Bob. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating upwards. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" adds a subtle pressure for Bob to decide quickly."
