# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your backup plan to maximize your savings."
